                "75. A legitimate expectation must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope and be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision. The hope that a long-extinguished property right may be revived cannot be regarded as a “possession”; nor can a conditional claim which has lapsed as a result of a failure to fulfil the condition (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no. 39794/98, §§ 69 and 73, ECHR 2002-VII). Further, no “legitimate expectation” can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant’s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts (see Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 50, ECHR 2004-IX). At the same time, a proprietary interest recognised under domestic law – even if revocable in certain circumstances – may constitute a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Beyeler, cited above, § 105)."

Prior to the retirement age, the disability pension is an exceptional benefit granted to individuals on the ground of their disability.

The Government added that, had the law not been amended, she would once again have become eligible when her health impairment was again assessed as exceeding the relevant threshold in 2012.

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured.

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme.

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

In this line of cases, the “legitimate expectation” was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopecký, cited above, § 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v.

In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v.

Accordingly, from 2001 until 2009/10, that is, for almost ten years, the applicant fulfilled all the conditions of eligibility for receiving a disability pension as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51, quoted in paragraph 80 above). The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

Due to that legislative change, she was denied disability allowance on the ground that she was not eligible under the newly introduced contribution rules. This state of affairs was then reaffirmed in the applicant’s individual case, with authoritative force, by the final judgment of the Nyíregyháza Administrative and Labour Court, adopted on 20 June 2013 (see paragraph 23 above). It is only if her legitimate expectation continued to exist until 1 January 2012 that this legislative amendment could be considered to constitute an interference with the applicant’s possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Moreover, it was not in dispute between the parties that her medical situation would have made her eligible for the disability benefit in 2012 had the new law not entered into force earlier that year.

The change in the law effectively imposed on a certain category of insured persons, including the applicant, a condition whose advent had not been foreseeable during the relevant potential contributory period and which they could not possibly satisfy once the new legislation entered into force – a combination of elements which is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law. The Court points out at this juncture that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective” rather than theoretical and illusory (see Perdigão v. Portugal [GC], no. 24768/06, § 68, 16 November 2010).

Furthermore, whilst approving the withdrawal of the applicant’s disability pension as of 1 February 2010, the Labour Court expressly confirmed that a new medical assessment could take place in 2012 and drew her attention to the possibility of making a renewed application should her health deteriorate (see paragraph 16 above)."

The applicant company did not attempt to bring such proceedings following the prosecutor ’ s refusal of its request for return of the impounded property. The Court finds that this omission is of no consequence in the circumstances of the case, given that the applicant company ’ s complaint before the Court was about the lorry ’ s forfeiture which had been imposed with a final act at the end of the criminal proceedings against its driver. The legal possibility referred to by the Government might have only achieved the temporary release of the seized lorry to the applicant company, while the criminal proceedings were pending, but would not have affected the result of the criminal proceedings against the driver about which the applicant company complains. Those proceedings ended with a court - approved plea bargain agreement under the terms of which the lorry was forfeited with reference to the applicable criminal - law provision, Article 242 § 8 of the Criminal Code.

As to the Government ’ s suggestion that the applicant company, a third party to those proceedings, could have asked the prosecutor to seek to reopen the case with a view to the applicant company recovering its property, the Court notes that such a situation is hardly compatible with the Convention requirements of direct access to a court, given that reopening would have depended on the prosecutor ’ s will (see Stanev v.

Those proceedings were unsuccessful as the driver had no assets at the time. In any event, the Court notes that even in situations where the State confiscates the tools or proceeds of a crime, it can only deprive someone of their property in accordance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which include requisite procedural guarantees (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, § 55 and § 62, Series A no. 108, where the Court held that the applicable domestic procedures had to ensure either that reasonable account was taken of the behaviour of the applicant company or to afford it a reasonable opportunity to put its case; see also Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, § 43, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII, and Grayson and Barnham v. the United Kingdom, nos. 19955/05 and 15085/06, § 45, 23 September 2008 ). In the present case the State was at the origin of the confiscation and domestic law and practice did not provide for any procedure through which the applicant company could have its property rights defended. Consequently, the Court finds that the State cannot relieve itself of its responsibility under the Convention to provide for such a procedure by asking the person who was not tried for the criminal offence leading to the confiscation to seek recovery of their property from a third party."

                "36. According to the well-established case-law of the Court, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention comprises three distinct rules. The first rule, which can be found in the first sentence of the first paragraph and which is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that States are entitled to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to enforce laws to secure, among other things, the payment of penalties. The Court has repeatedly held that the second and third rules must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, § 48, Series A no. 108; Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, § 30, Series A no. 316 ‑ A; Bowler International Unit v.

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999-II). This means first that the measures should have a basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it be accessible to the persons concerned, precise and that the consequences of its application be foreseeable (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 109, ECHR 2000-I). The requirement of “lawfulness” within the meaning of the Convention also demands compatibility with the rule of law which includes freedom from arbitrariness (see East West Alliance Limited v. Ukraine, no. 19336/04, § 167, 2 3 January 2014 )."

                "38. Furthermore, any interference with peaceful enjoyment of possessions must strike a “fair balance” between the general interests of the community and the protection of an individual ’ s fundamental rights. Where possessions which have been used unlawfully are confiscated, such a balance depends on many factors, which include the property owner ’ s behaviour ( see Yildirim v. Italy (dec.), no. 38602/02, 10 April 2003). In such cases the national authorities are called upon to consider the property owner ’ s degree of fault or care, or at least the relationship between his or her conduct and the offence (see Yildirim, cited above). In addition, although Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirement, it has been construed to necessitate that persons affected by a measure interfering with their possessions be afforded a reasonable opportunity to put their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging those measures, pleading, as the case might be, illegality or arbitrary and unreasonable conduct (see Yildirim, cited above; see also AGOSI, cited above, pp. 18-19, §§ 54-55, and pp. 20-21, §§ 58-60, and Air Canada, cited above, p. 18, § 46; see also, mutatis mutandis, Arcuri and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 52024/99, ECHR 2001-VII, and Riela and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 52439/99, 4 September 2001). In ascertaining whether the above condition has been satisfied, the Court must take a comprehensive view of the applicable procedures (see AGOSI, cited above, § 55, Series A no. 108; Bowler International Unit v. France, no. 1946/06, §§ 44 ‑ 45, 23 July 2009; Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Denisova and Moiseyeva v. Russia, no. 16903/03, § 59, 1 April 2010 ). The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1 982, §§ 69 and 73, Series A no. 52).",

Examining whether the interference in the present case complied with the Convention requirement of “lawfulness”, the Court observes that the confiscation was the result of the application of domestic law, specifically Article 242 § 8 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 16 above). According to this provision and its interpretation by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 16, 18, 19 and 20 above), a vehicle which had served for the commission of the offence of trafficking was confiscated unless its value manifestly did not correspond to that of the drugs. On the basis of its text and related judicial practice the Court accepts that the relevant legal provision can be said to be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable."

                "42. As to the manner in which the national court applied that legal provision, the Court notes that although it can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention; in that sense the Court cannot question the way in which domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law, except in cases of flagrant non-observance or arbitrariness (see Microintelect OOD v. Bulgaria, no. 34129/03, § 39, 4 March 2014 ). It notes in this connection that in the present case the value of the lorry – about EUR 83,000 as established in an expert report during the criminal proceedings against the driver – was over three times higher than the value of the smuggled drugs (the latter having been estimated at about EUR 27,000 ). Even though the applicant company asked the court hearing the case not to confiscate the lorry, referring specifically to this legal provision (see paragraph 10 above), the national court did not respond to that request. Indeed, it does not appear that the national court assessed at any point in time whether the value of the vehicle significantly exceeded that of the smuggled drugs, although this was a requirement in domestic law."

The Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the question of lawfulness because, in any event, it finds that the confiscation of the applicant company ’ s lorry is incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on other grounds (see for the same approach in the context of other Convention provisions requiring proportionality of the interference with the aim pursued, Funke v. France, 25 February 1993, § 51, Series A no. 256 ‑ A; Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, p. 1362, § 38). The Court will examine the applicant ’ s complaints that the domestic legislation did not meet the Convention “fair balance” requirements from the perspective of whether the interference was necessary for the achievement of the legitimate aim pursued (see for a similar approach Microintelect, cited above, § 39, in which the applicant owned confiscated alcohol and had no available procedure to have its case heard; see also, mutatis mutandis, Yordanova and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 25446/06, § 108, 24 April 2012)."

            [
                "45. Assessing whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the confiscation and the aim sought to be realised, the Court observes that the national courts did not consider the legality of the confiscation under national law (see paragraph 42 above). Nor did they examine the conduct of the confiscated lorry ’ s owner or the relationship between the conduct of the latter and the offence. There is no evidence before this Court suggesting that the owner could or should have known of an offence being committed and the owner was clearly not given an opportunity to put its case. Indeed, a possibility for such an examination was not provided for in domestic law, yet it was necessary under the Convention so that the authorities could assess the proportionality of the confiscation (see paragraph 38 above). Consequently, the absence of such an analysis by virtue of the applicable law did not allow to strike a “fair balance ” between the different interests involved."
            ],
            [
                "46. Finally, and most importantly, the Government did not suggest that the confiscation was carried out according to a procedure in which the applicant company could put its case to the national authorities, or that indeed such a procedure existed at all at national level. Since the applicant company was not a victim of the offence, but a third party affected by the criminal proceedings against the driver, there was no basis for it to intervene in those proceedings. The Court considers that forfeiture would only have complied with the Convention requirements if it were carried out in accordance with a procedure offering appropriate safeguards against arbitrariness (compare and contrast the present case with Phillips, cited above, § 43, where the Court found that the confiscation order procedure was compatible with the Convention requirements of “fair trial” and “peaceful enjoyment of possessions” as it was decided by a court in judicial proceedings which included a public hearing, advance disclosure of the prosecution ’ s case and an opportunity for the applicant to adduce documentary and oral evidence; contrast it also with AGOSI, cited above, § 62, where the Court held that the British system ensured that reasonable account was taken of the behaviour of the applicant company and afforded it a reasonable opportunity to put its case). The Court refers in this connection also to its conclusion in Hentrich, cited above, § 49, where it found that the applicant “ bore an individual and excessive burden which could have been rendered legitimate only if she had had the possibility – which was refused to her – of effectively challenging the measure taken against her ... and that the fair balance which should be struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest was therefore upset”. As pointed out above, in the present case there was no procedure available domestically to the applicant company to put its case before the relevant authorities."

However, the Court notes that in the present case the applicant company complained mainly of the manner in which the national courts interpreted and applied domestic law in proceedings between two rival claimants to the same name, it being contended in particular that the courts wrongly gave retrospective effect to the Bilateral Agreement, rather than of the retrospective application of a law which deprived them of their pre-existing possessions. The Court observes that, even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies, the obligations of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right of property. In particular, the State is under an obligation to afford the parties to the dispute judicial procedures which offer the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly in the light of the applicable law. However, the Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see García Ruiz v.

Budějovický Budvar appealed against that decision to the Lisbon Court of Appeal, alleging, inter alia, a breach of Article 189 § 1, sub- paragraphs ( l ) and (j), of the Code of Industrial Property. In a judgment of 21 October 1999, the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the impugned judgment and ordered the NIIP to refuse to register “ Budweiser ” as a trade mark. The Court of Appeal did not consider that there had been a breach of Article 189 § 1 ( l ) of the Code of Industrial Property, as the expression “Budweiser” was incapable of misleading the Portuguese public as to the origin of the beer concerned. However, it found that such a registration would infringe the Bilateral Agreement and, consequently, Article 189 § 1 (j) of the Code of Industrial Property. In that connection, it noted that the Bilateral Agreement had remained in force, following an exchange of notes between the Czech and Portuguese governments (see paragraph 25 below) and had been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of Article 8 of the Constitution, which contained a clause providing for international law to take effect in the Portuguese legal system."

The applicant company also alleged that, in any event, the protected appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ” did not correspond to the German expression “ Budweiser ”, so that the Bilateral Agreement could not be used to challenge its application for registration. The applicant company argued that, even supposing that the German expression “ Budweiser ” was an accurate translation of the Czech appellation of origin, the Bilateral Agreement applied only to translations between Portuguese and Czech, not to translations into other languages. It submitted, lastly, that the Bilateral Agreement was unconstitutional owing to a formal defect in that it had been adopted by the government, not Parliament, in breach of Articles 161 and 165 of the Constitution governing parliamentary sovereignty."

In that connection, it acknowledged that the legal position of an applicant for the registration of a trade mark incontestably gave rise to financial interests, including a right of priority over subsequent applications.

In other words, the applicant company had a conditional right, which however was extinguished retrospectively for failure to satisfy the condition, namely that it did not infringe third-party rights. The Chamber therefore concluded that while it was clear that a trade mark constituted a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this was so only after final registration of the mark, in accordance with the rules in force in the State concerned. Prior to such registration, the applicant did, of course, have a hope of acquiring such a “possession”, but not a legally protected legitimate expectation. Accordingly, when the Bilateral Agreement came into force on 7 March 1987 the applicant company did not have a “possession”.

It argued that an application for registration had a pecuniary value and was therefore a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as, under the Court ’ s case -law, the concept of “possessions”, which had an autonomous meaning, was not limited to the ownership of physical goods but included certain other rights and interests that constituted assets."

The applicant company possessed such a legitimate expectation, as indeed the dissenting judges had acknowledged in their opinion appended to the Chamber judgment.

That interference with its rights was not provided for by law, since the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement was erroneous and contrary to the general principles of international law. The Portuguese courts had wrongly ruled that the Bilateral Agreement afforded protection of the appellations of origin referred to in Appendix A against translations of the names concerned into any other language, when in fact the Agreement only covered translations into Portuguese and Czech.

The domestic courts had not cited the risk of confusion alleged by the Portuguese Government between the “ Budweiser” mark and the relevant appellations of origin, but had relied instead solely on Article 189 § 1 ( j) of the Code of Industrial Property. Furthermore, the interference was disproportionate as it had failed to strike the requisite fair balance between the general interest and the right of individuals. It also pointed out in that connection that it had not received any compensation for the loss of the use of its mark, despite the fact that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify the lack of payment. Furthermore, conflicts between trade marks and indications of source were now commonplace and the means were available under international law to resolve them satisfactorily. The Supreme Court ’ s decision to give the 1986 Bilateral Agreement precedence over the prior application to register the “ Budweiser” mark was contrary to international law, in particular the TRIPs Agreement and the relevant Community directives."

In their submission, under the applicable law, a mark became a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only upon final registration. Prior thereto, an applicant for registration did not even possess a legitimate expectation.

When the application for registration was lodged on 19 May 1981 the right to use the term “ Budweiser ” had already been registered by Budějovický Budvar, which explained why the NIIP had not immediately processed the application. In that connection, the Government stressed that when the Bilateral Agreement between Portugal and the Czech Republic was signed in 1986, only Budějovický Budvar was entitled to use the term “ Budweiser ” ( as an appellation of origin ). Budějovický Budvar had, moreover, immediately contested the NIIP ’ s decision in 1995 to register the mark and had gone on to win the proceedings. The Government therefore argued that the applicant company had at no stage during that period been able to claim any “legitimate expectation” that would have entitled it to the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In point of fact, such dealings were generally the result of a dispute between two companies over an application to register a mark with the transfer of the application serving to settle the dispute. In the Government ’ s submission, that practice tended to support the view that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was not applicable to such applications."

They noted that the relevant provisions, in particular Article 7 § 1 of the Code of Industrial Property, made it clear that the competent authorities could only issue such a certificate when the judicial decision on the application for registration had become final. Although, despite this, the applicant company had inadvertently been issued with a certificate by the competent authorities, it was aware that it had no value in law and, furthermore, that its use in Portugal was an administrative offence which carried the same penalties as a minor offence under the provisions of domestic law."

In any event, the interference was provided for by law, namely the Bilateral Agreement of 1986, which formed part of Portuguese domestic law. It also pursued a legitimate aim: the Portuguese courts ’ decision under the Bilateral Agreement was primarily intended to ensure compliance with domestic law, particularly as it concerned the Portuguese State ’ s international obligations, but also to avoid risks of confusion over a product ’ s source. The Government observed in that connection that, although the Portuguese courts had not relied on Article 189 § 1 (l) of the Code of Industrial Property as a basis for refusing registration of the mark, it was apparent from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment that it had also taken into account in its reasoning the risk of confusion with the Czech appellation of origin. The Government added that any interference there may have been had been entirely proportionate. Noting that the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation when it came to defining the public interest, the Government observed that the State was entitled to determine the conditions under which a trade mark would be eligible for registration. In particular, it was at liberty to decide that third-party interests should be protected, under a procedure provided for by law. In the present case, the domestic courts had merely interpreted and applied the relevant domestic legislation.

The Court observes that, even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies, the obligations of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right of property. In particular, the State is under an obligation to afford the parties to the dispute judicial procedures which offer the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly in the light of the applicable law.

The reason for this is that in the present case the very question whether the legislation was retrospectively applied is in itself in issue whereas, in the above - mentioned cases, not only was the retrospective effect of the legislation indisputable, it was also intentional. Indeed, it has not been established that the applicant company had a right of priority in respect of the “ Budweiser ” mark when the Bilateral Agreement, which is alleged to have been applied retrospectively, came into force. In this connection, the Court points out that the only effective registration in existence when the Bilateral Agreement took effect on 7 March 1987 was of the appellations of origin that had been registered in Budějovický Budvar ’ s name under the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1 958.

In this connection, it does not appear that the lorry was adapted for smuggling drugs, nor were there any previous incidents caused by a failure on the part of the applicant company to prevent illegal shipments from being transported by its vehicles which would raise the question of the applicant company ’ s own responsibility for the commission of the criminal offence in question (see, by contrast, Air Canada, cited above, §§ 6 and 44). This, coupled with the fact that the lorry driver was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to nine years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 11 above), hardly allows for the conclusion that the lorry might be used again for transporting illegal substances (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilevski, cited above, § 58). In the light of the above, the Court fails to see what adverse effects might be expected to result from the return of the lorry to its owner. This is particularly true if, as argued by the Government, the applicant company was in any event able to buy the lorry back at public auction. Also, assuming that it was indeed the applicant company that bought the lorry at the auction, the Court would point out that this cannot be considered to have remedied the damage caused to it by the confiscation because the reacquisition of the vehicle was contingent on the payment of the price attained at auction."

On 21 May 2009 the Maribor Higher Court modified the first-instance judgment and, relying on Sections 73(3) and 186(5) of the Criminal Code, ordered the confiscation of the lorry. It held that the legislative framework provided for mandatory confiscation in cases of drug-related criminal offences since the nature of their commission, their magnitude and the dangerous consequences thereof called for the extension of coercive measures to persons who were not the perpetrators of the criminal offence, irrespective of whether or not the owners of the vehicle knew what the perpetrator had been transporting. The Higher Court explained that in accordance with Section 73(2) of the Criminal Code, objects used in the commission of a criminal offence could be confiscated even when they did not belong to the perpetrator, in so far as the third party ’ s right to claim damages from the perpetrator was not thereby affected. Moreover, Section 73(3) provided for the possibility of mandatory confiscation in cases provided for by the statute. Thus, Section 186(5) of the Criminal Code implemented those two provisions by providing mandatory confiscation of the means of transport used for transportation and storage of illegal substances."

It complained in particular that it had not known that the lorry was being used for illegal purposes, adding that the first-instance court had explicitly established its non-involvement in the commission of the criminal offence at issue. Claiming that it had not had an effective possibility to prevent the abuse of its property for criminal purposes, the applicant company stressed that the lorry had been subject to regular controls concerning possible vehicle modifications and hidden compartments. Thus, according to the applicant company, the measure complained of constituted a punishment and an unjustified and disproportionate interference with its property and that it had not had the opportunity to participate in the criminal proceedings."

In reviewing the contested legislation, the Constitutional Court confirmed the Higher Court ’ s view that Section 186 of the Criminal Code provided for mandatory confiscation of vehicles used for the transportation and storage of drugs or illegal substances in sport, regardless of their ownership. According to the Constitutional Court, drug-related criminal offences sanctioned under Section 186 of the Criminal Code represented a great evil and an extremely high degree of threat not only from the perspective of the individual, but also from the perspective of society as a whole; the purpose of the impugned measure was to prevent the commission of such criminal offences in the future and thus to protect important legal values in society, such as health and life – especially of young people. The Constitutional Court stressed that the nature of the criminal offences in question, the manner in which they were committed and their consequences justified the interference with the ownership rights of all owners of the means of transport used for drug-trafficking, regardless of their potential involvement in the criminal activities at issue, adding that a different regulation governing the confiscation of goods would diminish considerably the possibilities for effectively preventing the criminal offences in question."

In this connection, the Constitutional Court pointed out that legal certainty required that every instance of legally recognised damage be adequately protected. Thus, by virtue of Section 73(2) of the Criminal Code, the confiscation did not affect the right of third parties to claim compensation from the offender. Under the general rules of tort law, the injured owner had the possibility and the right to exact compensation from the person responsible for the damage. The Constitutional Court added that it was for the regular courts to establish in each individual case whether all the elements required for recognition of the alleged damage and thus for payment of compensation were fulfilled."

The applicant company ’ s argument that the lorry should have been confiscated only if it had had a specially adapted space for the transportation and storage of drugs was therefore not correct.

The Government stressed that the criminal offences referred to in Section 186 of the Criminal Code constituted a great evil posing an extremely serious threat to the health and life of individuals. It was in the public interest to prevent the commission of this type of criminal offence by enacting effective measures. With the measure at issue the legislator wanted to prevent the commission of this type of criminal offence in order to reduce the threat to the most important values in society – human health and life. The perpetrators of such criminal offences were not discouraged by the fact that they did not own the means of transport that they used in order to conceal illegal drugs. An interference with the property of third persons inevitably formed part of the fight against organised crime to protect the highest values and goods of human society. The nature of such criminal offences, the manner in which they were committed and the consequences they had for people ’ s health and lives justified the mandatory confiscation of means of transport, regardless of the ownership of the vehicle(s) concerned. It could reasonably be expected that any regulatory arrangement (e.g. mandatory confiscation only if the means of transport was owned by the perpetrator) different from that applied would considerably have reduced the possibilities for effectively preventing these criminal offences."

Therefore, it constituted an instance of control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which authorises States to enact “such laws as [they deem] necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest” (see, for example, Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, §§ 33 and 34, Series A no. 316 ‑ A, and Yildirim v. Italy ((dec.), no. 38602/02, 10 April 2003). However, it is noted that those judgments concerned temporary restrictions on the use of property (see Air Canada, cited above, § 33), or a possibility of restitution of ownership (see Yildirim, cited above). By contrast, in the present case the confiscation involved a permanent transfer of ownership and the applicant company had no realistic possibility of recovering its lorry. In this connection, the Court considers that confiscation of an instrument for the commission of criminal offences from a third party does not involve the same level of urgency as confiscation of proceeds or objects of a criminal offence, viewed from the perspective of policy responses in the general interest. Thus, it may in certain circumstances be examined under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which covers deprivation of property. In fact, in a similar case of Andonoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no. 16225/08, § 12, 17 September 2015 ), which included the confiscation of the applicant ’ s car used in committing a criminal offence, the Court decided that the permanent nature of the measure which entailed a conclusive transfer of ownership, without the possibility of recovery, amounted to a deprivation of property (ibid., § 30). The Court considers that the same approach should be adopted in the present case.",

According to the Court ’ s case-law, an interference for the purposes of that paragraph must be prescribed by law and must pursue one or more legitimate aims; in addition, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim or aims sought to be realised. In other words, the Court must determine whether a balance was struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individual or individuals concerned (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, §§ 69 and 73, Series A no. 52, and James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 50, Series A no. 98). In doing so it leaves the State a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see AGOSI, cited above, § 52, and Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v.

In this connection, the Court notes that the Higher Court and Constitutional Court both considered that the then applicable legislation, notably sections 73(3) and 186(5) of the Criminal Code provided for mandatory confiscation of the means of transport used for the transport of drugs (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). In its decision, the Constitutional Court expressly confirmed that transporting illegal drugs resulted in mandatory confiscation of a vehicle in which the drugs were found (see paragraph 14 above), and found the measure to be consistent with the Constitution. Indeed, in the Court ’ s opinion, the provision of Section 186(5) of the Criminal Code, as applicable at the material time, read in conjunction with Section 73(3) which allowed for mandatory confiscation of objects used in the commission of a criminal offence (see paragraph 18 above), does not support the applicant company ’ s allegation that the confiscation of its lorry was tainted by arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 108, ECHR 2000 ‑ I). The interference was thus in accordance with the domestic law of the respondent State."

The Court must consider whether the applicable procedures in the present case were such as to enable reasonable account to be taken of the degree of fault or care attributable to the applicant company or, at least, of the relationship between the company ’ s conduct and the breach of the law which undoubtedly occurred; and also whether the procedures in question afforded the applicant company a reasonable opportunity of putting its case to the responsible authorities ( ibid. § 55).

However, contrary to the above-mentioned cases, the higher instances interpreted the relevant domestic legislation as entailing mandatory confiscation of any vehicle used for drug trafficking, regardless of the diligence and good faith displayed by the owner. As a result, even though there was no indication that the applicant company had been involved in the commission of the alleged criminal offence or that it had any knowledge about the illegal activities of its driver or that it had failed to carry out regular controls of the vehicle, it did not have any effective possibility of securing the return of its lorry (see paragraphs 11-15 above). The relevant domestic legislation (Section 186(5) of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with Section 73(3)) thus took no account of the relationship between the applicant company ’ s conduct and the offence (see Vasilevski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 22653/08, § 57, 28 April 2016)."

In the Court ’ s opinion, there can be no doubt that the protection of human health and life – the grounds cited as justification for the measure – requires decisive action on the part of the Contracting States to reduce drug related criminal offences. That said, the confiscation of property used in the commission of such offences may, as in the present case, impose a significant burden on the third parties to whom the property belongs. The exercise of balancing the general interests of crime prevention and the protection of the affected individual ’ s rights (see paragraph 39 above and Air Canada, cited above, § 36) in these circumstances thus means that imposing such a burden on the owner of the property concerned can be justified only if his interest in having the property returned to him is outweighed by the risk that its return would facilitate drug trafficking and undermine the fight against organised crime."

In this connection, it does not appear that the lorry was adapted for smuggling drugs, nor were there any previous incidents caused by a failure on the part of the applicant company to prevent illegal shipments from being transported by its vehicles which would raise the question of the applicant company ’ s own responsibility for the commission of the criminal offence in question (see, by contrast, Air Canada, cited above, §§ 6 and 44). This, coupled with the fact that the lorry driver was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to nine years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 11 above), hardly allows for the conclusion that the lorry might be used again for transporting illegal substances (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilevski, cited above, § 58). In the light of the above, the Court fails to see what adverse effects might be expected to result from the return of the lorry to its owner. This is particularly true if, as argued by the Government, the applicant company was in any event able to buy the lorry back at public auction. Also, assuming that it was indeed the applicant company that bought the lorry at the auction, the Court would point out that this cannot be considered to have remedied the damage caused to it by the confiscation because the reacquisition of the vehicle was contingent on the payment of the price attained at auction."

Moreover, relying on Section 73(2) of the Criminal Code, the Government maintained that the domestic legislation provided the applicant company with an effective opportunity to obtain compensation for its pecuniary loss by seeking it from the driver convicted of drug trafficking, who was the party responsible for the damage the company sustained. However, in a similar situation the Court has previously held that a compensation claim of this nature entailed further uncertainty for a bona fide owner of confiscated property because the offender might be found to be insolvent. The compensation claim was not held to offer bona fide owners sufficient opportunity for bringing their cases before the competent national authorities (see Bowler International Unit v. France, no. 1946/06, §§ 44-45, 23 July 2009, and, mutatis mutandis, Vasilevski, cited above, § 59).

In this connection, it does not appear that at the time that the complaint was lodged, which is approximately eight months after the new Criminal Code became applicable, there was established domestic case-law on the question of whether in cases of drug trafficking, also the means of transport belonging to third parties were to be mandatorily confiscated. It rather seems that the applicant company ’ s constitutional complaint provided the first opportunity for the Constitutional Court to rule on the issue and clarify the scope of the third-party owners ’ options with regard to confiscation of their vehicles in the criminal proceedings involving drug trafficking. The Court, reiterating that the only remedies which an applicant is required to exhaust are those that relate to the breaches alleged and which are at the same time available and sufficient (see Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 39, ECHR 1999-III), thus takes the view that the applicant company ’ s choice of legal remedies was reasonable. This being so, the Court considers it excessive to require the applicant company to embark on another set of proceedings against the driver of the confiscated lorry with the aim of recovering a loss that resulted from the actions of the domestic authorities. Therefore, the Government ’ s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed."

The Regional Court found that the fact that the applicant had been fully unfit for farm work was undisputed and acknowledged by the defendant (the Fund). Moreover, referring to the medical report dated 18 June 2010 ordered for the purpose of the pending court proceedings and issued by experts in internal medicine, orthopaedics, neurology and psychiatry, the court established that the applicant had been completely unfit for farm work throughout the whole period starting from the end of March 2008 – that is to say from the day on which he had stopped receiving the above mentioned pension. The forensic experts – of whom at least two (the neurologist, a certain J.W., and the orthopedist, a certain J.B.) – had also issued their respective medical reports for the purpose of the previous set of proceedings in which the applicant ’ s disability pension had been discontinued, had prepared their latest reports on the basis of the medical documentation previously available to them, as well as on the medical files relating to the applicant ’ s treatment in the Szczecin Neurosurgical Clinic in December 2009. The court noted that they had indicated, without providing further details, that during the previous set of proceedings they had not had at their disposal the complete medical documentation and procedural files concerning the applicant ( dokumentacja orzecznicza ). Thus, in the reports issued for the purposes of the second set of proceedings they had reached a conclusion contrary to their previous findings, even though the applicant ’ s state of health had not improved and he had been completely unfit for farm work for the whole time.

The District Court established that the medical experts had confirmed that they had not had at their disposal the complete relevant medical documentation and procedural files when they had issued the first medical report concerning the applicant. As a result, their second medical report had contained conclusions contrary to their previous evaluation of the applicant ’ s state of health. Nevertheless, it held that it could not override the final and legally binding judgment of 26 November 2011 issued by the Szczecin Court of Appeal, neither with respect to the appellate court ’ s legal assessment nor the underlying factual findings, owing to the scope of the principle of res iudicata, as provided in Article 365 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Kodeks postępowania cywilnego ), which precluded it from ruling anew on the issue of whether the applicant had been completely unfit for farm work after 31 March 2008.

The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many authorities, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, § 48, Series A no. 108, and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

This provision places no restriction on the Contracting State ’ s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit ‑ whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions ‑ that legislation must be regarded as generating possessions falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 54, ECHR 2005-X)."

In particular, the requisite “fair balance” will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, §§ 69-74, Series A no. 52, and Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], cited above, § 78). Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant ’ s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence.

The Government submitted that such properties, held under special privileges and immunities, did not come within the concept of property or possessions protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On the other hand, the private property of European monarchs was not treated differently in any way from the property of ordinary citizens. It was acquired, used and transferred in accordance with the ordinary rules of domestic civil law, as applied to all transactions between private individuals.

                "52. In the present case the Government submitted that the most significant special feature of the legal status of the alleged “royal property” of the Greek Crown was that it had always had a sui generis and quasi-public character. This was demonstrated by various facts. First, the three contested estates had not been acquired by the former royal family in accordance with the general provisions of Greek civil law, but because of the functions of the beneficiaries. A substantial part of these properties were donated to the former Greek kings by the Greek State as a sign of respect towards the royal institution. Second, whenever a succession to the throne occurred, the general rules of inheritance law did not apply. On the contrary, a special law was always enacted to avoid the ordinary order of succession and settle the relevant disputes. Third, the alleged properties enjoyed full tax exemption, including exemption from inheritance tax. Had inheritance tax been applied in each of the four successions to the Greek throne from 1913 to 1964, the relevant tax burden would have exceeded the current market value of the contested estates. Fourth, the property in question had not only been assimilated to State property for procedural purposes (for example special time-limits, award of State privileges for the recovery of debts, prohibition of provisional forced execution), but had also benefited from substantial State prerogatives (non-prescription of claims, plain prohibition of usucaption, criminalisation of trespass, etc.). Therefore, no matter how each of the contested estates had been acquired, the land, which included constitutionally protected forests, historical and archaeological sites, had only been kept wholly intact and even added to because of the privileges attached to the monarchs' public status. No ordinary Greek citizen would ever have succeeded in legally acquiring and transferring this land."

The applicants replied that there was manifestly no foundation whatever, as a matter of historical fact or Greek law, for the Government's novel and bizarre argument that the property which was the subject of their claim never belonged to the royal family. The applicants stressed that this argument had never been advanced by any Greek government except in the course of the proceedings before the Convention organs. The fact that individual members of the royal family had owned private property had been consistently recognised by Greek public authorities throughout the period of the so-called “crowned democracy” which had been established when the first applicant's ancestor, George I, was elected King in 1863. It had also been consistently recognised after the creation of the Republic. Such private property had always been recognised as being distinct from any property that was made available to the royal family by virtue of the constitutional status of the King, for example, the Royal Palace in Athens, which was not and had never been the private property of the royal family. As regards certain privileges which were historically afforded in respect of their property, the applicants considered that those privileges had no bearing on the status of the royal family's private property. In any event, maintenance payments by the State some fifty years earlier had been made in recognition of the damage which had been caused to the properties during the period when they were in the possession of the State and had been neglected. As for the tax exemption, the applicants invited the Court to bear in mind that the King had paid all of the very considerable expenses incurred by him in the exercise of his official duties in his capacity as Head of State. Until 1949, the King had also had to pay all the maintenance and running costs of the palaces made available to him by the State in his capacity as Head of State out of the Civil List."

The applicants further submitted that the fact that the royal family owned private property had been clearly recognised even during the period of the unconstitutional military dictatorship between 21 April 1967 and 24 July 1974. The 1968 Constitution included a provision (Article 134 § 3), which provided for a unique legislative measure to be enacted to expropriate or confiscate the movable and immovable property of the former King and his family. A legislative decree (no. 225/1973) had subsequently been issued by the dictatorship to confiscate the property of the royal family. These measures would have served no purpose if the royal property had always belonged to the State. After the fall of the dictatorship, a legislative decree of 1974 had recognised that the property confiscated by the dictatorship belonged to the royal family, on whose behalf it was administered by a special committee. In 1979 the movable property was handed over to the royal family. Protocols governing the handing over of the immovable and movable property had been duly signed by the appropriate governmental authorities and by the special committee. The status of the property had in no way been affected by the outcome of the referendum of 8 December 1974 which had resulted in the establishment of a presidential parliamentary republic. The status of the property of the royal family had simply not been in issue in that referendum. Nor had the status of the property been affected by the enactment of the 1975 Constitution. If this had been the case, the State would not have returned the movable property to the royal family in 1979, thus recognising their rightful ownership."

This agreement was concluded on the basis that he was the owner of the property in question; otherwise it would have served no purpose.

Furthermore, the applicants stressed that the 1994 Law expressly mentioned Legislative Decree no. 225/1973 enacted by the military dictatorship, under which the property of the royal family had been confiscated.

On 28 September 1992 the Division of Scientific Studies of the Greek parliament issued a report on a draft bill ratifying this agreement, which stated, inter alia, that Legislative Decree no. 225/1973 was repealed by Legislative Decree no. 72/1974 and that the property thereby “reverted to its former ownership status” (see paragraphs 38-39 above)."

That was the reason why, after the abolition of the monarchy in 1924, the Bafi land came ipso jure and without any compensation to the State.

The estate was subsequently added to through the acquisition by King George I from the Greek State of an area of land known as the Bafi forest (see paragraph 9 above). Notwithstanding the manner of acquisition of these lands, disputed by the parties, their ownership status was settled as follows: In 1924 Tatoi, including the Bafi forest, was compulsorily expropriated by the Greek State without payment of any compensation. In 1936, following the restoration of the monarchy, a law returned Tatoi to the ownership and possession of King George II. This reinstatement of property included the Bafi land except an area of 3,785,000 sq. m. which had in the meantime been allotted to homeless refugees.

However, it notes that, according to the ordinary provisions of Greek civil law, property rights may be acquired by a variety of ways, as by transfer from a previous owner, and that donation is undoubtedly one of the valid ways of transferring and acquiring property rights. Moreover, the Court considers that the Government have failed to substantiate their argument that the capacity of King George I as Head of State was the only causa traditionis of Mon Repos. Furthermore, it notes that the estate was subsequently enlarged by successive purchases of land belonging to third parties, and that the State does not seem to have been involved in the relevant contracts. In 1937 a law transferred the estate in full ownership and possession to Prince Andreas. Following a chain of transfers, the first applicant acquired full ownership of Mon Repos, by virtue of his father's holograph will (see paragraph 20 above)."

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see the Amuur v.

The first had remained in force after the restoration of democracy and the second was voted in Parliament following an open and democratic debate. Undeniably, both these laws had an individual character. However, the circumstances of the case were unique: in any recent republic there was only one former royal family. Such a family was not in a position comparable to that of any other family. Legislation relating to their property would, by definition, relate to that family alone; still, that could not deprive the legislation of its legitimacy."

As for Legislative Decreeno. 225/1973, the applicants submitted that it amounted to an arbitrary act of confiscation by the military dictatorship, which was in any event completely irrelevant to the taking of their property in 1994."

It is true that in the present case the applicants have contested the constitutionality of this Law before the domestic courts and the Convention organs and have argued that the challenged provisions, being unconstitutional, did not offer a valid legal basis for the deprivation of property of which they complain. However, the applicants' complaints of the unconstitutionality of Law no. 2215/1994 have been examined and rejected by the Special Supreme Court in its judgment of 25 June 1997 (see paragraph 46 above). The Court observes that it is in the first place for the domestic authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law and to decide on issues of constitutionality. Having regard to the judgment of the Special Supreme Court, the Court cannot find that Law no. 2215/1994 was unconstitutional.

History showed in all abolished European monarchies that, with the exception of the private property of King Manuel II of Portugal, the private possessions of all former monarchs or emperors were in one way or another expropriated without compensation or without full compensation. Moreover, the reason why the Law of which the applicants complained had been enacted only in 1994 was simply that complicated legal and political issues took a long time to resolve."

The applicants claimed that the taking of their property was not part of any national economic or social programme and that the 1994 Law did not itself explain why it was necessary. In particular, as regards the allegation that the taking of their property was motivated by the need to protect the forests and the archaeological sites within the three estates in question, the applicants maintained that during all the years when the relevant forests and archaeological sites were in the possession of the royal family, there had never been any complaint as to the way in which they were looked after; in the applicants' eyes that argument by the Government wholly lacked credibility. Furthermore, they considered that the Government had not explained how the public interest was served by a taking of the private property of the former monarch. The private property of a former monarch and his family was by definition unconnected with his former role as Head of State, and was in no way linked to the constitutional transition from a monarchy to a republic. And, in any event, this transition took place in 1975, almost twenty years before the enactment of Law no. 2215/1994. The applicants stressed that the former King had on several occasions formally acknowledged the Hellenic Republic, to which he presented no threat whatsoever. Moreover, there had been no disputes between the applicants and the Greek State concerning the applicants' property or any other matters at the time of the enactment of the 1994 Law.",

                "87. The Court is of the opinion that because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.",
                "Furthermore, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p. 32, § 46). The same applies necessarily, if not a fortiori, to such fundamental changes of a country's constitutional system as the transition from a monarchy to a republic."

On the other hand, it does not doubt that it was necessary for the Greek State to resolve an issue which it considered to be prejudicial for its status as a republic. The fact that the constitutional transition from a monarchy to a republic took place in 1975, namely almost twenty years before the enactment of the contested Law, might inspire some doubt as to the reasons for the measures, but it cannot suffice to deprive the overall objective of Law no. 2215/1994 of its legitimacy as being “in the public interest”.",

Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, § 69). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see the Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, § 38).",
                "Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. In this connection, the Court has already found that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances (see the Holy Monasteries v. Greece judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, p. 35, § 71)."

Having regard to the fact that it has already been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary, the lack of compensation does not make the taking of the applicants' property eo ipso wrongful (see, a contrario, the Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece ( Article 50 ) judgment of 31 October 1995, Series A no. 330-B, pp. 59-60, § 36). It remains therefore to be examined whether in the context of a lawful expropriation the applicants had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden."

That was because there was no requirement of “necessity” in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and decisions in this area commonly involved the assessment of political, economic and social questions on which opinions within a democratic society might genuinely and reasonably differ widely. The margin of appreciation was especially wide when, as here, the former royal family had come into possession of the relevant properties for reasons based on their royal status. The democratic legislature was entitled to consider that, as part of the constitutional settlement, the former royal family had no right to demand compensation (far less full compensation) for what they had acquired because of their royal duties. In other words, exceptional circumstances – such as the ways in which the property was acquired and used, the privileges which were in the past afforded to the former royal family, the tax exemptions for the royal estates and the maintenance of the latter at the expense of the Greek State – justified the absence of any compensation."

In this way, the former royal family had been spared payment of substantial tax debts. Furthermore, Legislative Decree no. 225/1973, which the 1994 Law maintained in force, provided for pecuniary compensation as well, amounting to GRD 120,000,000. This sum had been placed at the disposal of the applicants but was never collected by them, no doubt for political reasons associated with their wish to remain on the throne."

Both Tatoi and Polydendri were forest land, therefore subject to a special protected status: their use could not be changed and they would always remain forests; they could not be divided up into smaller parcels of land; their exploitation was under the supervision of the State. Consequently, there was no buyer interest in them and their real commercial value was insignificant. Moreover, the restrictions on their exploitation, in connection with the high cost of maintaining, guarding and operating them, reduced their real market value. Their commercial value was further reduced by the fact that they included archaeological sites, which could not be commercially exploited by private citizens. In this connection, the Government stressed that at the Mon Repos estate there was an extensive archaeological site, Paleopolis, which was believed to have been the capital of the Phaecians in Antiquity. For this reason, the Ministry of Culture had already designated 23 ha of the estate as a protected area."

They considered that, as a matter of legal principle and logic, the manner of acquisition of a property had no bearing on the extent to which proportionality required that there should be compensation for its taking. The fact that a person had acquired a piece of property as a gift, or by inheritance, did not mean that the property had no value for the owner, so that it could be taken without compensation. The requirement of proportionality demanded that the owner be fairly compensated for what he had lost, regardless of how he (or his predecessors in title) had acquired the property which had been taken."

This was so a fortiori in relation to privileges or tax exemptions which might have been available to the applicants' predecessors, but which had not been afforded to the applicants themselves; further, since 1974, the applicants had had no tax privileges whatsoever. In any event, this was not a case in which there were cross-claims as between a creditor and a debtor, which could properly be set off against each other so as to extinguish or reduce the creditor's claim.

                "In the first place, the Court points out that at least part of the expropriated property was purchased by the applicants' predecessors in title and paid out of their private funds. Moreover, compensation was provided for the last time the property was expropriated, in 1973. Therefore, the Court considers that the applicants had a legitimate expectation to be compensated by the Greek legislature for the taking of their estates.",

Nor can the circumstances to which the Government refer be regarded as payment of compensation. In this respect the Court agrees with the applicants when they argue that in the context of the expropriation in question there are no reciprocal or mutual debts to be set off against each other. The privileges afforded in the past to the royal family or the tax exemptions and the writing off of all the taxes owed by the former royal family have no direct relevance to the issue of proportionality, but could possibly be taken into account in order to make an accurate assessment of the applicants' claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention."

However, in the present case the plaintiff undoubtedly has no possibility of inspecting the premises or safes of the former Public Security Regional Administration in Bratislava as he is not allowed to enter those premises. By insisting that the applicant should show that the coins are at the last known place, the Court would impose a burden of proof on him which it is practically impossible to fulfil.

In particular, the Regional Court noted that, in accordance with the relevant practice, the confiscated property should have been handed over to the public prosecutor and, after the relevant judgment had became final, to the financial department of the competent local government authority. The Regional Court therefore examined the criminal file concerning the case of the applicant ’ s father. It further established that the archives of the Senica District Office, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Bank of Slovakia and the State Regional Archives in Bratislava contained no document relating to the coins in question. The Regional Court also heard a witness who had worked at the Myjava District Office of the Ministry of the Interior in 1958; the latter had no knowledge of the case, however. It did not consider it necessary to hear two other persons, one of whom had been present when the coins were inventoried and taken over by the Regional Administration, as those persons had been dismissed from service in 1958 and in 1960 respectively.

By way of contrast, the hope of recognition of a property right which it has been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.

In particular, the Court reiterates that the Convention imposes no specific obligation on the Contracting States to provide redress for wrongs or damage caused prior to their ratification of the Convention. Similarly, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be interpreted as restricting the freedom of the Contracting States to choose the conditions under which they agree to return property which had been transferred to them before they ratified the Convention (see paragraph 35 above)."

In the majority ’ s view, the finding of the Senica District Court (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above) indicated that the applicant could claim, at least on arguable grounds, that he met the relevant requirements for the restitution of his father ’ s property. There thus existed a “genuine dispute”. The applicant ’ s claim was not therefore unsubstantiated or devoid of any prospect of success, and the applicant had a “legitimate expectation” of having his claim satisfied which justified considering it as a possession within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 28 and 29 of the Chamber judgment referred to above)."

Ireland (judgment of 29 November 1991, Series A no. 222, p. 23, § 51). In that case, the Court found that a “legitimate expectation” arose when outline planning permission had been granted, in reliance on which the applicant companies had purchased land with a view to its development. The planning permission, which could not be revoked by the planning authority, was “a component part of the applicant companies ’ property”."

The Court found that the applicant had to be regarded as having at least a “legitimate expectation” of exercising the option to renew and this had to be regarded, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as “attached to the property rights granted to him ... under the lease” (see Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 35, 24 June 2003 )."

In the above cases, the persons concerned were entitled to rely on the fact that the legal act on the basis of which they had incurred financial obligations would not be retrospectively invalidated to their detriment. In this class of case, the “legitimate expectation” is thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which has a sound legal basis and which bears on property rights."

                "48. Another aspect of the notion of “legitimate expectation” was illustrated in Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium (judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 21, § 31). The case concerned claims for damages arising out of accidents to shipping allegedly caused by the negligence of Belgian pilots. Under the domestic rules of tort, such claims came into existence as soon as the damage occurred. The Court classified the claims as “assets” attracting the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It then went on to note that, on the basis of a series of decisions of the Court of Cassation, the applicants could argue that they had a “legitimate expectation” that their claims deriving from the accidents in question would be determined in accordance with the general law of tort.",
                "The Court did not expressly state that the “legitimate expectation” was a component of, or attached to, a property right as it had done in Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others and was to do in Stretch (see references in paragraphs 45 and 46 above). It was however implicit that no such expectation could come into play in the absence of an “ asset ” falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, in this instance the claim in tort. The “ legitimate expectation ” identified in Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others was not in itself constitutive of a proprietary interest; it related to the way in which the claim qualifying as an “asset” would be treated under domestic law and in particular to reliance on the fact that the established case-law of the national courts would continue to be applied in respect of damage which had already occurred."

                "49. In a line of cases the Court has found that the applicants did not have a “legitimate expectation” where it could not be said that they had a currently enforceable claim that was sufficiently established. In a case against the Czech Republic where the applicants ’ claim for restitution of their property under the 1991 Act failed because they had not met one of the essential statutory conditions (nationality of the respondent State), the claim was not sufficiently established for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. There was a difference, so the Court held, between a mere hope of restitution, however understandable that hope may be, and a “legitimate expectation”, which must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope and be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova, cited above, § 73)."

Similarly, no legitimate expectation can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant ’ s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts. In Jantner ( cited above, §§ 29-33), the applicant ’ s restitution claim was dismissed as the national courts found that he had not established his permanent residence in Slovakia within the meaning of the relevant law and practice. That finding was contested by the applicant, who considered that he had met all the statutory requirements for his restitution claim to be granted. The Court held that under the relevant law, as interpreted and applied by the domestic authorities, the applicant had neither a right nor a claim amounting to a “legitimate expectation” within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law to obtain restitution of the property in question."

                "51. In Gratzinger and Gratzingerova and Jantner, which concerned claims for restitution of property, it may be considered that what was in fact in issue was not so much a “legitimate expectation” according to the principles defined in Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others (see paragraphs 45 -47 above), but rather whether or not the applicants had a claim amounting to an “asset” as defined in Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others (see paragraph 4 8 above). In the two above- mentioned restitution cases, it could not be said that the applicants had any property rights which had been adversely affected by their reliance on a legal act. Moreover, as they failed to fulfil a statutory condition for the restitution of property, there was, unlike the situation in Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others, no sufficiently established proprietary interest to which a “legitimate expectation” could be attached."

In the light of the foregoing, it can be concluded that the Court ’ s case-law does not contemplate the existence of a “ genuine dispute ” or an “ arguable claim ” as a criterion for determining whether there is a “ legitimate expectation ” protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court is therefore unable to follow the reasoning of the Chamber ’ s majority on this point. On the contrary, the Court takes the view that where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “ asset ” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it.",

In the light of the above analysis of the case-law, the Court has still to consider whether there was nevertheless a sufficient legal basis in support of the applicant ’ s claim to warrant its being regarded as an “asset” in the Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others sense."

Accordingly, the principal question for the Court is whether there was a sufficient basis in domestic law, as interpreted by the domestic courts, for the applicant ’ s claim to qualify as an “asset” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this respect, the only point in dispute is whether the applicant could be said to have satisfied the requirement that he show “where the property [ was ] ”, as laid down in section 5(1) of the 1991 Act. For his part, the applicant considered that, contrary to the findings of the Bratislava Regional Court and of the Supreme Court, he had fulfilled that requirement by showing when and how the property had been transferred to the State, as the competent authority was unable to explain what had subsequently happened to the coins."

In their respective decisions, the Bratislava Regional Court and the Supreme Court held that section 5(1) of the 1991 Act included an obligation to show where the movable property in question had been on 1 April 1991, when the Act had come into force. The Supreme Court further found that a claim for restitution of movable property under section 5(1) of the 1991 Act could only concern the very property which had actually been taken over by the State, and not different objects of the same nature. This decision was consistent with its earlier finding on a similar claim (see paragraph 24 above). The Regional Court and the Supreme Court held that the evidence submitted by the applicant and the further evidence taken by the Regional Court itself did not constitute sufficient proof that in 1991 the Ministry of the Interior still possessed the coins which had been taken away from his late father in 1958."

At present it is very difficult to make such an estimation. ... In practice, every legal successor [of a Bug River claimant] could, and can, obtain a certificate – at present, a decision – [confirming the right to] a share in the abandoned property. What should be the criteria according to which the number of satisfied and unsatisfied claims is to be estimated? Should it be the number of applications made, including [several] applications by legal successors regarding one property abandoned by one owner ( testator), or should it be the number of properties abandoned beyond the State's borders?",

This situation creates conditions in which the entitled persons may abuse their rights – a fact of which governors and mayors have notified us. They accordingly suggest that a register ... of the certificates issued confirming the entitlement to ... compensatory property be kept. At present, however, there is no single, comprehensive system for the registration of certificates and decisions entitling claimants to [compensatory property].",

                "“The first issue to be dealt with concerns the empowerment of the [communist authorities that concluded the Republican Agreements] to enter into international agreements. There is no doubt that the Polish Committee of National Liberation cannot be considered a constitutional entity of a sovereign State, with corresponding democratic legitimacy and capable of taking sovereign decisions in the name of the State.",
                "The scope of compensation set out for repatriated persons in the Republican Agreements was in no way equivalent or proportionate to the scope of compensation that the States with which these Agreements were concluded took upon themselves as an obligation. In most cases the repatriation was de facto in one direction, as most evacuees were former Polish citizens from the territories lost by the Polish Republic as a result of the Second World War. As a consequence, despite a considerably greater material burden of resettlement and repatriation, Poland, by virtue of the 1952 Pact, was obliged to pay the USSR the substantial sum of 76 million roubles (Article 2 of the 1952 Pact). As in the case of the change in Poland's borders, this type of obligation can certainly not be treated as a sovereign decision by the Polish State authorities.",
                "It should be mentioned at this point that similar burdens in connection with the consequences of the war were also borne by other States, but in no case, with the exception of Germany, was the weight of the burden comparable to the one the Polish State had to bear. It is worth recalling that meeting these obligations was further complicated by the considerable material losses suffered during the war and immediately afterwards. Under these conditions, it was evident that the process of affording satisfaction to the repatriated persons, as set forth in the agreements with the USSR and the Soviet Republics concerned, had to be moderate and spread over time. This also means that it is necessary to take into consideration the difficult financial situation of the State and, above all, the situation of groups of citizens other than the Bug River repatriates. Undoubtedly, the consequences of the war were felt by Polish society as a whole. In this connection, it cannot be argued that, for example, compensation that is incomplete, subject to time - limits or taking a specific form is automatically in contradiction with the principle of justice. This view also applies to mechanisms providing only partial compensation for losses suffered as a result of acts of war and territorial changes.”"

                "82. The judgment, which contained extensive reasons, was based on the following main grounds:",
                "“ ( 1) The Republican Agreements gave rise to a specific type of State obligation to award compensation, through appropriate domestic law, to persons who had lost property in connection with the delimitation of Poland's borders after the Second World War. The Republican Agreements did not constitute a direct basis for repatriates to lodge compensation claims, as the legislature was left free to determine how the compensation machinery would be set up. The State's responsibilities in this regard, as undertaken in successive legal regulations, are matters left for an independent decision by the legislature.",
                "( 2) The right to credit, which provides for the possibility of offsetting the value of property lost by Polish citizens after being abandoned outside the present territory of the State against the sale price of immovable property or against fees for the right of perpetual use, constitutes a specific surrogate for the lost property rights, which is not solely a legal expectation of compensation but rather a property right recognised in the Republic's legal order as part of its public law. As such, this right enjoys the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution).",
                "( 3) The creation of legal frameworks for given institutions cannot be entirely abstracted from the factual circumstances and the economic realities in which the legal institutions thus established are to function. As a matter of principle, therefore, the legislature may not narrow down the possibility of benefiting from a general right granted to an individual so severely that the ultimate result is essentially a nudum ius, so that the property becomes an immaterial right devoid of any pecuniary value in practice. In the case of the so-called right to credit, its nominal value does not, however, correspond to its actual value. The depreciation of the value of this right has occurred as a result of the legislature excluding specific categories of immovable property, which has fundamentally limited the possibility of enjoying this right.",
                "( 4) All property rights within the legal order are subject to constitutional protection. An interference with the sphere of an entity's legally protected property interests, when it occurs without the formal removal of the entity's legal title, amounts to de facto expropriation, within the meaning adopted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Consequently, the assessment of provisions that eliminate the possibility of benefiting from a right in practice leads to the conclusion that they are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution.",
                "( 5) Legal solutions limiting the possibility of benefiting from the right to credit, within the framework determined by the law, and resulting in those rights being stripped of their substance, cannot be considered necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law, and are not functionally related to any of the values set out in Article 31 § 3 [of the Constitution] (the principle of proportionality).",
                "( 6) The requirement of respect for the principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the principle of the rule of law (Article 2 of the Constitution), entails a prohibition on enacting laws that would create illusory legal institutions. This principle therefore requires that the obstacles which prevent [persons] from benefiting from the right to credit be eliminated from the legal system. From the point of view of the confidence principle, in the case of the right to credit it is the means of protecting this right that is subject to assessment, rather than its substance. The lack of opportunity to benefit from this right, within the framework set out by the legislature, shows that an illusory legal institution has been created, and thereby constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the Constitution.”"

That term has already entered legal usage and has frequently been referred to in many subsequent judicial decisions and various legal texts.",
                "The court considered that even though that right originated in the provisions of the Republican Agreements, section 212 constituted the actual legal basis for it. In that regard, it held that those agreements did not constitute part of the domestic legal order since, even though they had been ratified, they had not been published in the Journal of Laws and could not be regarded as a source of law within the meaning of Article 91 of the Constitution.",

In the opinion of the Constitutional Court, it constitutes a specific surrogate for property rights rather than a mere expectation of the right to compensation, and for this reason it should be recognised as enjoying the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2). In the assessment of the Constitutional Court, it is justified to hold that the right to credit is a special property right of a public - law nature. It is not a proper ownership right, but neither can it be reduced to the category of a potential right in the sense of a maximum formulated expectation [ ekspektatywa maksymalnie ukształtowana ]. Even though materialisation of the right depends on action by the entitled person, it would not be justified to conclude that this right does not exist until the time of its realisation resulting from winning a bid, in which the entitled person may offset the value of abandoned property against the value of acquired property or against fees for perpetual use. ...",

                "In the present legal circumstances, one can identify a peculiar functional paradox in that a general right laid down in the legislation in force cannot be materialised in practice. Consequently the right to credit is becoming more and more of an'empty obligation'and is turning into a nudum ius. Maintenance of the present trend, in which various types of State Treasury land are excluded from the application of the right to credit will mean that there is no hope of this right materialising in the future. This state of affairs is already resulting in an unfavourable and paradoxical situation: entitled persons who have been waiting for years to be able to participate in competitive bids and, subsequently, in the course of such bids, being aware of how difficult it is to realise their right to credit,'push up'the price of the property to a level considerably exceeding its market value.",
                "In the present circumstances, in order to assess the possibility of taking advantage of the right to credit, one must take into consideration not only the limitation of the availability of certain types of property, with varying degrees of justification, but also the actual opportunities for enforcement of this right and its economic value.",
                "The statutes restricting repatriates'access to State Treasury property essentially result in de facto expropriation, whereby it is impossible to enjoy the right to credit either at present or in the future, in the sense in which this concept is used in the European Court of Human Rights'case-law cited above. ...",
                "The unconstitutionality of the limitations set out in section 212 ( 1 ) and section 213 of the Land Administration Act 1997, in section 17 of the 1993 Amendment, and in section 31 ( 4 ) of the 1996 Act, consists precisely in the fact that the general right (the right to credit) was formulated in such a way that it could not be materialised in the existing legal environment, so that it has become illusory and a mere sham. Moreover, it is not just a question of temporary impossibility, conditioned by certain factual and legal circumstances, but rather a question of the creation of legal constructions that exclude this possibility ex thesi. In the case at hand, assessment of the possibility of this right materialising is all the more essential in that the legislature, in accepting the principle of the State's obligations towards repatriates on the basis of the international agreements, failed at the same time to establish any alternative compensation mechanism. For several decades, the right to credit has been the only available de lege lata solution allowing for compensation of the material losses suffered by Polish citizens as a result of territorial changes in the 1940s. ... ”"

                "“[T]he protection of property rights does not mean that it is completely impossible to interfere with their substance, or that they are absolutely inviolable ... What is necessary is to remain within the constitutional framework which sets out the boundaries for constitutional protection of a given property right [references to the relevant judgments of the Constitutional Court ]. Such limitations are introduced by the Constitution in Article 31 § 3. In the Constitutional Court's case-law it has been indicated on many occasions that this provision provides tests for determining the conditions for the admissibility of limitations on the enjoyment of constitutional rights and freedoms. ...",
                "In this context, it is important to note the Constitutional Court's position expressed in the judgment of 12 January 2000, [references], according to which the scope of such limitations must not cause annihilation of the fundamental components of the general right, resulting in its being'stripped'of its real substance and turned it into a legal fiction. Such a situation leads to a constitutionally unacceptable violation of the fundamental substance or the essence of that right. ...",
                "In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be recognised that all the provisions referred to in the Ombudsman's application, which limit the actual scope of property in respect of which the procedure set out in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 can be applied, are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.",
                "Such limitations are not justified in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. The aims set out in section 17 of the 1993 Amendment, and the grounds provided for limiting the right to credit in the case of property entrusted to the Military Property Agency, namely the need for funds to modernise the armed forces, must not be pursued in a manner that deprives only a specific group of persons of the possibility of realising property rights vested in them.",

This type of solution can never be recognised as necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Neither is there any functional connection between that limitation and the pursuance of the aims referred to in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution. The need to introduce limitations could arise if the realisation of the right to credit were to make it impossible to satisfy the legally protected interests of other persons. In particular, the existence of the right to credit does not lead to a situation in which the rights of other persons might be violated (for example, the rights of former owners who have been given priority or persons with a right of pre-emption).",
                "At the same time, it should be stressed that the unconstitutionality of these provisions is not connected with a legislative omission consisting of the lack of certain regulations regarding compensation for the Bug River repatriates. Rather, it arises from the defective legal formulation of the provisions governing the question of compensation, which causes an inadmissible systemic dysfunction. It must be stressed that in creating a general property right, the State may not at the same time arbitrarily introduce, by taking advantage of the attributes of State power, such limitations which, by excluding substantial stocks of property from the compensation procedure, de facto paralyse the possibility for beneficiaries to derive any economic advantage from these rights. ”"

                "“This principle means, first and foremost, the need to protect and respect properly acquired rights and to protect interests that have not yet been vested ... but it also encompasses a prohibition against the legislature creating legal constructions that cannot be implemented and constitute an illusion of law, and hence a pretence of protecting those property interests that are functionally connected with the substance of the established general right.",

For it must be stressed yet again that in the case of the so-called'right to credit,'its nominal value does not correspond to its real value. This depreciation occurs precisely because the possibility of realising this right has been limited to a significant extent through legislation excluding certain categories of property. ...",
                "The imperative of adherence to the principle of maintaining confidence in the State, which encompasses, as indicated above, a prohibition against creating law that introduces fictional legal institutions, requires the elimination of legal obstacles that make it impossible to enjoy the right to credit. The Constitutional Court cannot assess to what extent a properly functioning right to credit could repair the damage caused by the loss of'property beyond the Bug River'. The resolution of this problem, which is part of the general issue of redress for the losses sustained by particular groups of the population as a result of the country's historical territorial changes and changes in ownership introduced several decades ago, lies within the competence of the legislature. ...",
                "Essentially, then, the important point here is the implementation of the postulate that legal regulations should be formulated in such a way as to secure to the individual not only legal certainty, but also complete foreseeability as to the extent to which their implementation will affect the individual's legal position in particular legal situations. The compensation mechanism introduced for persons who were deprived of their property as a result of territorial changes resulted in the development of legitimate expectations, on the part of those concerned, that this problem would be definitively resolved in the future, with due consideration for the interests of all persons in whom this right to credit was vested. The opinion that there has been a violation of the principle of maintaining confidence in the State and the law made by it, is further strengthened by the lack of alternative forms of compensation in the legal system. ...",
                "Elimination from the legal system of the limitations introduced by sections 212 and 213 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and by the other individual provisions, would make it possible for the remainder of the credit mechanism to become a real, and not, as hitherto, fictional instrument of compensation. This Court has not assessed the advisability of selection by the legislature of specific means of satisfying the repatriates'property interests, since the determination of concrete institutional solutions is within the legislature's independent sphere of competence. Therefore, it is the compensation machinery already set out in legislation that has been subjected to assessment from the point of view of constitutional guarantees.",
                "It should be pointed out in passing that, in addition to the compensation procedure directly established by section 212 of the Land Administration Act, the legislature recently introduced a new possibility for the realisation of the right to credit in the Law of 5 December 2002 on amendments to the Law on the exercise of the State Treasury's powers, the Law on commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises and other statutes, which enters into force on 14 January 2003, and which adds a third subsection to section 53 of the Law of 30 August 1996 on the commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises. On the basis of this provision, the persons referred to in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 have been given the possibility of crediting the value of abandoned property against the sale price of a privatised enterprise, corresponding to the value of rights to certain items of immovable property included among the assets of the enterprise, or against the sale price of such rights not included among the assets. This is a new form of the right to credit and it is to be expected that it will broaden the possibility of obtaining actual compensation for lost property. However, the new regulation does not in principle change the assessment of the right to credit, as formed by the provisions contested in this case. For the existence of a new form of the right to credit ... does not free the legislature from ensuring that the compensation machinery, as examined in the present case, is designed in such a way as to be a genuine instrument for the protection of the individual's property rights and not just a legal fiction.",

The court established that from 1991 to 1998 the Cracow District Office [9] had organised twenty-two auctions for the sale of property in which Bug River repatriates could participate. In certain auctions only those persons who had made applications for compensation before 26 May 1990 had been able to make bids. In 2002 the mayor of the Cracow District had begun to hold auctions, but throughout that year there had been only two such auctions.",

Also, there were situations where the State Treasury's Agricultural Property Agency organised auctions from which, under the relevant provisions, persons from beyond the Bug River were excluded.",
                "Particular attention should, however, be given to situations where auctions did not exclude persons from beyond the Bug River. These occurred extremely rarely. In such situations a large group of persons who had entitlements to compensation would participate. These people, concerned that, owing to the small stock of property set aside to satisfy their claims, they would not be able to obtain any satisfaction, would increase their bids for the property in such a way that the price of the property for sale was several times higher than its market value. It was symptomatic that only persons from beyond the Bug River took part in these auctions, although the organisers also permitted the participation of persons who were able to buy the property in cash. In one of the auctions a property whose reserve price, assessed in line with market valuations, was 115,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 700,000 zlotys. In another auction a plot with a building that had been used as a dissecting room, and which had a reserve price of just over 200,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 1,500,000 Polish zlotys. In the context of the above situation, it suffices to say that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, that is, within the territory of the former Cracow Province and part of the Nowy Sącz Province, only about twenty entitled persons out of a total of some 300 having certificates or administrative decisions took advantage of their right to credit and, of these, nobody obtained full compensation for their entitlement. It should be added that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, 3,600 persons tried to obtain certificates confirming their right to receive an equivalent to the abandoned property.”",
                "The court further found that the plaintiffs, or their predecessors, had earlier refused to accept two offers of compensatory property. It considered the refusal justified since the condition for obtaining the first property, a plot of land, had been to construct a house on it within four years, whereas the plaintiffs had not had the means for such an investment. The second offer had been to choose one of three tenement houses in another town, but those houses had been in a catastrophic state."

In this way, finding themselves in a highly pressured situation, they lost a large part of their entitlement. The severe limitations placed on the possibility of satisfying their entitlements in effect brought about its elimination. This situation, where the State has created the circumstances described above, is in effect a totally unjustified expropriation [and amounts to] taking from persons from beyond the Bug River property rights to which they are entitled. Even the creation of such a situation should be considered a state of lawlessness with regard to the rights of repatriated persons.",

If the legislature does not fulfil the above conditions, it is in breach of Article 64 § 2 of the Constitution and enacts lawlessness. ...",

While the legislature, in section 81 of the 1985 Act and in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, gave persons from beyond the Bug River the right to credit the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of building plots or the price of buildings or premises situated on land belonging to the State Treasury, the subsequent acts rendered ineffective any possibility of this social group satisfying that entitlement.",
                "In essence, the damage sustained by repatriated persons, and also by the plaintiff in the context of the present case, consists of the difference between what they should have been able to have within the value of their entitlement, pursuant to section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and what they actually have in practice, as a result of the wrongful manner in which the State has implemented the law. ...",
                "In accordance with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, everyone has the right to obtain compensation for unlawful acts carried out by a public authority. The liability of the State Treasury follows from Article 417 of the Civil Code, linked as it is with the functioning of a public authority as a whole, rather than with specific persons connected to that institution, bearing in mind that responsibility arises if there is an unlawful act. Furthermore, the functioning of the public authorities should be taken, in a wider sense, as an act or omission, as specific actions, or as orders, judgments, administrative decisions, quasi-normative statutes and, finally, legislative activity. ...",

                "It is completely understandable that the plaintiffs, after obtaining the certificates that confirmed their entitlements as laid down in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, did not participate in auctions organised by the [authorities], since the number of auctions of which they could have been aware was very small. However, in the context of the number of repatriated persons who were entitled to take part in auctions, any possible participation in an auction could result in their losing a significant proportion of their entitlement.",

Moreover, no pecuniary compensation was provided in section 212, which laid down another specific procedure for the discharge of the State's obligation. The plaintiffs could have obtained compensation only if they had proved that it had been impossible for them to obtain any compensatory property within the entire territory of Poland. In that context, the court stressed that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all means available under domestic legislation. They had not participated in auctions and had refused to buy the compensatory property offered to them by the authorities. Only through their active participation in the auctions could the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they had difficulty in satisfying their claim. The Court of Appeal also held that there was no basis for attributing tortious liability to the State, in particular liability for the alleged legislative inactivity.

However, it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court's judgment ... concerned, as mentioned above,'the elimination of restrictions from the system'; hence there are no grounds for adopting the position expressed in the communiqués made available to the public on the Internet. As a result, this possibility [of satisfying claims] remains illusory for the Bug River people.",

In the light of the constitutional provisions cited above, it therefore cannot constitute a source of law, since it did not come within the domestic legal order. Consequently, this agreement cannot be applied directly or relied on as a basis for the plaintiffs'claims. A similar opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 19 December 2002, which has already been mentioned in connection with the findings of fact made in the present case. ...",

The basis expressed for this opinion was that, in the opinion of the Minister, the agreement had been executed inter partes, and therefore terminated, given the conclusion of the 1952 Pact with the government of the USSR. ...",

But then one must ask the question why, for example, the Supreme Court in its case-law, quoted so extensively in the present case, has bothered over the last fifty years with the issue of agreements which were no longer in force? For instance, in the well - known resolution of seven Supreme Court judges of 30 May 1990 (III CZP 1/90, ...), the Supreme Court ruled not only on section 88(1) of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1985, which set out the right to credit, but also on the Republican Agreements of 1944, and considered the substance of Article 3 § 6 [11]. ...",

To put it in precise terms, the public authority refrained from acting, despite a statutorily formulated duty to do so, and hence it acted in breach of the law (objective unlawfulness). Hence the first of the conditions of liability required by Article 417 of the Civil Code, read in conjunction with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, is fulfilled. ...",
                "In its findings of fact, this Court found that the plaintiffs could not satisfy their claims under the Land Administration Act 1997, since the State Treasury, as represented by the mayor, had not made it possible for the right to credit to be enjoyed, given that it had not offered any immovable property for auction, and that this situation had lasted for years. In these circumstances, as rightly pointed out by the Constitutional Court, this right had become illusory.

But this absence is the result of an unlawful omission by the executive power, which neglected to publish the Agreement in the Journal of Laws.",

This pecuniary damage consists in the fact that it is impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy their claims through a civil action based on Article 3 § 6 of the Agreement, given that the result of such a process is prejudged at the present time (rejection of the claim, or, as in the present proceedings, an indication that such a basis is unfounded).

Some civil courts considered that the State was liable for damage sustained by the Bug River claimants on account of both the fact that it had imposed unjustified restrictions on the exercise of the right to credit and the fact that it had failed to fulfil its positive obligations to protect property rights and duly to publish the Republican Agreements (see paragraphs 9 8 and 10 2 above).

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 79, ECHR 2000- XII, with further references, and Iatridis, cited above, § 58).",

The principle of a “fair balance” inherent in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 itself presupposes the existence of a general interest of the community. Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.",

It is also true that, pursuant to the January 2003 and the August 2003 Ordinances, the Bug River claimants were exempted from the payment of a security before an auction for the sale of State Treasury and municipal property, and that the offsetting of the value of their entitlement against the price of property sold at such auctions could no longer be excluded (see paragraphs 90 and 92 above).",

To begin with, on the date of entry into force of that judgment, the State Treasury's Agricultural Property Agency and the Military Property Agency issued official communiqués, disseminated via the Internet. Both communiqués were worded similarly and announced that the agencies had suspended all auctions for the sale of State property because, allegedly, they could not be held before numerous amendments to the legislation had been introduced (see paragraphs 30-32 above ). This policy resulted in the effective suspension of the execution of the judgment because the provisions restoring State agricultural and military property to the pool of property available to the Bug River people could not be implemented in practice. It was strongly condemned by the judicial authorities, most notably the Supreme Court, which deemed such acts to amount to constitutional torts. However, neither the executive nor the legislative power reacted to the agencies'conduct (see paragraphs 30-32, 98, 102 and 110 above).",

On the contrary, it is capable of undermining the credibility and authority of the judiciary and of jeopardising its effectiveness, factors which are of the utmost importance from the point of view of the fundamental principles underlying the Convention and which, in the context of the present case, must prevail over any conceivable considerations of economic or social policy that might have been behind the Polish State's failure to rectify the policy of the agencies concerned.",

The minimal number of auctions organised in the Cracow District in the 1990s and the large number of claimants, with similar yet unsatisfied claims, demonstrated that, as established by the Cracow Regional Court, it had been almost impossible for him to enforce his right to credit.

The same applied to the auctions mentioned by the Government, at which the land in question had been sold for sums several times in excess of the reserve prices and, also, significantly exceeding the value of his entitlement, as stated in the valuation report supplied to the Court by the Government."

It went on to find that “the lack of opportunity to benefit from this right, within the framework set out by the legislature, show[ed] that an illusory legal institution [had] been created”. It held that, in consequence, the existing compensation machinery had become a “fictional instrument of compensation” (see paragraphs 82-86 above).",

It cannot be said that the applicant was responsible for, or culpably contributed to, the state of affairs of which he is complaining.

The choice of measures may necessarily involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value. Thus, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances (see James and Others, cited above, p. 36, § 54 ).",

In the context of the present case, it was incumbent on the Polish authorities to remove the existing incompatibility between the letter of the law and the State-operated practice which hindered the effective exercise of the applicant's right of property. Those principles also required the Polish State to fulfil in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner, the legislative promises it had made in respect of the settlement of the Bug River claims. This was a matter of important public and general interest ( see paragraph 150 above). As rightly pointed out by the Polish Constitutional Court (see paragraph 82 above), the imperative of maintaining citizens'legitimate confidence in the State and the law made by it, inherent in the rule of law, required the authorities to eliminate the dysfunctional provisions from the legal system and to rectify the extra - legal practices."

Furthermore, the applicant's situation was compounded by the fact that what had become a practically unenforceable entitlement was legally extinguished by the December 2003 legislation, pursuant to which the applicant lost his hitherto existing entitlement to compensation. Moreover, this legislation operated a difference of treatment between Bug River claimants in so far as those who had never received any compensation were awarded an amount which, although subject to a ceiling of PLN 50,000, was a specified proportion (15%) of their entitlement, whereas claimants in the applicant's position, who had already been awarded a much lower percentage, received no additional amount (see paragraphs 115 and 118-19 above).",

This applies particularly to situations in which the compensatory entitlement does not arise from any previous taking of individual property by the respondent State, but is designed to mitigate the effects of a taking or loss of property not attributable to that State. What Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires is that the amount of compensation granted for property taken by the State be “reasonably related” to its value (see paragraph 176 above). It is not for the Court to say in the abstract what would be a “reasonable” level of compensation in the present case. However, given that – as acknowledged by the Government (see paragraph 35 above) – the applicant's family had received a mere 2 % of the compensation due under the legislation as applicable before the entry into force of the Protocol in respect of Poland, the Court finds no cogent reason why such an insignificant amount should per se deprive him of the possibility of obtaining at least a proportion of his entitlement on an equal basis with other Bug River claimants."

In James and Others, the issue was whether, in the context of leasehold - reform legislation, the conditions empowering long-term leasehold tenants to acquire their property struck a fair balance. The Court found that they did, holding that the context was one of social and economic reform in which the burden borne by the freeholders was not unreasonable, even though the amounts received by the interested parties were less than the full market value of the property.",
                "In Lithgow and Others (cited above) the Court examined an issue relating to the nationalisation of companies engaged in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries, as part of the economic, social and political programme run by the party that had won the elections, which was intended to provide a sounder organisational and economic footing and bring to the authorities a desirably greater degree of public control and accountability. The Court held that, in this context, the arrangements for compensating the shareholders concerned were fair and not unreasonable as compared with the full value of the shares.",

The State has a wide margin of appreciation when enacting laws in the context of a change of political and economic regime ( see, in particular, Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004-IX). The Court has reaffirmed this principle in Broniowski ( cited above, § 182), in the context of the country ’ s transition towards a democratic regime, and has specified that rules regulating ownership relations within the country “ involving a wide-reaching but controversial legislative scheme with significant economic impact for the country as a whole ” could involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value. The Court has also reiterated these principles regarding the enactment of laws in “ the exceptional context of German reunification ” ( see Von Maltzan and Others v. Germany (dec.) [GC], nos. 71916/01, 71917/01 and 10260/02, §§ 77 and 111- 12, ECHR 2005 -V, and Jahn and Others, cited above ).",
                "Lastly, in Papachelas (cited above ), the issue concerned the expropriation of more than 150 properties, including part of the applicants ’ property, for the purposes of building a major road. The Court held that the compensation awarded to the applicants had not upset the fair balance between the opposing interests, since it was only 1, 621 Greek drachmas per square metre less than the value of the land as estimated by the Association of Sworn Valuers.",

Furthermore, no one at all, in particular the courts, may rely on provisions that have been declared unconstitutional to assess a given situation, even if that situation arose prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality ( see, on this point, judgment no. 49 of 2 April 1970 and decisions no. 271 of 1985, no. 329 of 1985 and no. 94 of 1986).",

The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...",
                "As stipulated in section 2 ( 1 ) of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the ‘ violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the “ reasonable time ” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ’. In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said Court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.",
                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",
                "7. In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of compensation for non-pecuniary damage payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable - time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (Court HR, 27 March 2003, Scordino v.

Moreover, although Article 6 of the Convention guaranteed the right to a fair trial, it did not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or its assessment, which was therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law by the domestic courts.

Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution.

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes – payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision – the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal.

There are already dozens of applications before the Court that have been lodged by persons affected by an expropriation of property to which the impugned compensation criteria apply.

In theory it is not for the Court to determine what may be the appropriate measures of redress for a respondent State to take in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. However, having regard to the systemic situation which it has identified, the Court would observe that general measures at national level are undoubtedly called for in the execution of the present judgment, measures which must take into consideration the large number of people affected. Furthermore, the measures taken must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court ’ s finding of a violation, so that the system established by the Convention is not compromised by a large number of applications arising out of the same cause. Such measures must therefore include a mechanism for providing injured persons with compensation for the violation of the Convention established in the present judgment concerning the applicants. In that connection the Court ’ s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a malfunction found in the national system of human rights protection. Once such a deficiency has been identified, the national authorities have the task, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, of taking – retrospectively if necessary (see Bottazzi, § 22, and Di Mauro, § 23, both cited above, and the Interim Resolution of the Committee of Ministers ResDH(2000)135 of 25 October 2000 ( Excessive length of judicial proceedings in Italy : general measures ); see also Brusco, cited above, and Giacometti and Others v.

The Court recognises that in that case it found, in view of the convincing social - justice reasons put forward by the national authorities in the exceptional context of German reunification, that the absence of compensation did not upset the “fair balance” to be struck between the protection of property and the requirements of the general interest (ibid. , § 117), but it would emphasise that it was the unique nature of the general political and legal context – and not simply the exceptional nature of the circumstances – that secured its acceptance of expropriation without compensation.

According to the judgment, the expropriation was not based on the General Expropriation Act, as the applicants had claimed, since the measure in question had been decreed in the context of the Latvian land reform, and thus the special Law of 30 October 1997 was to be applied. Section 4 of the special Law provided that the mere existence of the law and the payment of compensation for the expropriation sufficed for the statutory transfer of title to the State. Noting in the present case that the corresponding sums had been paid into the applicants ’ accounts, the Regional Court found that both of those elements were present, and that by registering the State as the new owner of the land in question, the Land Registry Court had acted in accordance with the law."

In their view, this had not been the case, as, in particular, no expert ’ s report had been ordered for the purpose of determining the actual value of the disputed land (section 16 of the General Expropriation Act). The applicants did not challenge the Regional Court ’ s finding that the Law of 30 October 1997 constituted a lex specialis in relation to the general law; they argued, however, that the said law could not be construed as derogating from the normal expropriation procedure and that, consequently, by recognising the State ’ s title without having received a copy of a judgment determining the amount of the compensation, the Land Registry Court had acted illegally."

Addressing the applicants ’ objection to the compensation awarded, it pointed out that the amounts had been determined in accordance with Article 2 of the above-mentioned Supreme Council decision. If the applicants had considered that the calculation by the State ’ s Land Authority had been erroneous and that the relevant coefficients had been incorrectly applied, they could have challenged the calculation in separate proceedings, but they had not done so."

If such proceedings had taken place, they would have been able to provide the court with evidence of their investments in respect of the land in question; they pointed out that they were not entitled to initiate such proceedings themselves, as section 9 of the Act reserved that right for the State authorities."

The first applicant challenged this before the Ziemeļu District Court of First Instance, which upheld his claim and annulled the reassessment. The City Council appealed before the Riga Regional Court, which, in a judgment of 10 January 2003, upheld the annulment of the reassessment. In its judgment the court found that, as the land tax was attached to a plot of land and not to a specific individual, it could be paid by someone other than the owner. It noted that the tax had already been paid by the public corporation responsible for the port ’ s management which was using the land on the basis of a servitude.

The City Council appealed and on 26 February 2002 the Riga Regional Court annulled the judgment of the Court of First Instance, finding that the second applicant ’ s land was not part of that for which the public corporation had paid land tax. That judgment was upheld in cassation proceedings. However, in September 2003 the Senate of the Supreme Court reopened the proceedings on account of newly discovered facts. The case file was sent to the Administrative Court of Appeal, which, in a judgment of 15 July 2005, upheld the second applicant ’ s claim and annulled the disputed reassessment on the ground that the port management company had already paid land tax for the land in question.

In its judgment, the Chamber analysed the case in the light of the three conditions that must traditionally be fulfilled, according to the Court ’ s case-law, for an expropriation to be compatible with the Convention. As regards the first condition, namely that the expropriation must be carried out “subject to the conditions provided for by law”, the Chamber observed, like the Latvian courts, that the ordinary expropriation procedure in Latvia at the material time was governed by a general law, but that a special law enacted in 1997, providing for a derogation from the ordinary procedure, had been applied in the applicants ’ case. Whilst recognising that, before the enactment of the special law, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation would be carried out in the conditions provided for in the general law, the Chamber was of the view that this fact in itself was not sufficient to call into question the lawfulness of the special provisions that were applicable to them. Accepting the Government ’ s argument that the impugned expropriation had been part of the denationalisation process following Latvia ’ s restoration of independence, the Chamber accepted that, in this type of situation, a special law could lay down specific conditions for one or more individuals without infringing the requirement of lawfulness, and that the legislature should be afforded particularly broad discretion, in particular to rectify, on grounds of fairness and social justice, any loopholes or injustices created by the denationalisation. The Chamber did not find anything unreasonable or manifestly in breach of the fundamental objectives of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the special Law of 30 October 1997."

Lastly, as to the third condition, requiring a “fair balance”, the Chamber noted an extreme disproportion between the current cadastral value of the properties and their 1940 value, on the basis of which the compensation had been calculated, being some 350 times lower than the cadastral value. However, it analysed this disproportion in the light of a certain number of considerations, noting firstly that the very significant increase in the value of the properties concerned reflected the development of the port facilities and the complete evolution of the land ’ s strategic importance between 1940 and 1990, these being objective factors to which the applicants had not contributed in any way; secondly, that the applicants had acquired the properties free of charge and had possessed them for only three years without investing in them or paying taxes in respect of the land; thirdly, that the applicants had benefited from a “windfall”, receiving rent arrears of about EUR 85,000 and about EUR 593,150 respectively; and fourthly and lastly, they had been afforded appropriate procedural guarantees. Taking into account these facts as a whole and the above- mentioned considerations relating to the need to rectify any injustices created by the denationalisation process, the Chamber accepted that, in the very specific circumstances of the case, the compensation received by the applicants had not been disproportionate. It accordingly found that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "71. The applicants began by challenging any attempt to call into question the manner in which they had acquired the properties at issue. In their submission, the reason why the contracts of donation had been signed almost simultaneously was because the operation of the land registry had been resumed only at the end of 1993 and until that time it had been impossible to register any transfers of title. They further recognised that they had themselves initially decided to indicate minimal values for the properties in question, but pointed out that cadastral values did not exist at that time and that, under the legislative provision then in force (see paragraph 64 above ), the sole basis for the calculation of the registration tax was the sale price, which in this particular case could not be determined objectively. They explained that in those circumstances, which were outside their control, they had paid the minimum fee necessary for the registration of their title in the land register and that purely for the sake of form had they indicated the relevant sums in the contracts of donation. Alleging that they could not have known that in future the compensation due to them for the expropriation of their land might depend on the amount of the fee paid for the registration of their title, they argued that it would be unfair to use this against them."

                "72. As to compliance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the applicants first argued that their case could not be examined in the context of the restitution laws, because they did not belong to the category of former property owners to whom the State had returned property confiscated by the USSR. They contended that the reservation made by Latvia when ratifying Protocol No. 1, to the effect that Article 1 thereof did not apply to “ the laws ... which regulate the restoration or compensation to the former owners or their legal heirs of property nationalised, confiscated, collectivised or otherwise unlawfully expropriated during the period of Soviet annexation”, could not be invoked against them because they had acquired the land in question under ordinary civil contracts entered into with individuals who were already registered as owners of the land, thus indicating in their view that the land reform had already been finalised in respect of the properties in question. In this connection they referred to a judgment of the Administrative Division of the Supreme Court Senate in which it was stated that “the property reform is a single measure that is completed with the transfer of the real estate concerned to private ownership”. They inferred from this that, at the time when they acquired the land in question, it had become as freely disposable as any other private property and that it would be erroneous to regard their case as falling within the context of the land reform."

They observed that, within the meaning of the Court ’ s settled case-law, the notion of “lawfulness” necessarily implied the foreseeability of the legal consequences of the provision in question and that such foreseeability had been lacking in the present case. In this connection they first asserted that the Latvian authorities had not applied the ordinary procedure provided for by the General Expropriation Act, under which compensation had to be determined by agreement and to correspond to the value of the expropriated property, and, secondly, that the final sum had not been decided by the competent court but by the State Land Authority."

Moreover, they argued that the 1996 law amending Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 1992 had to be regarded as an ad personam measure specially intended by the legislature to apply to their specific situation. In support of this argument they pointed out that the law had not been enacted until December 1996, at a time when they had already owned their land for two years, that they alone fell within the scope of the new wording of the last paragraph of Article 2 and that they had effectively been the only ones to have been affected by that provision. In this connection they referred to the wording of section 19 ( 5 ) of the Ports Act, as amended in 2002, which entitled owners of land situated on the territory of ports to compensation calculated on the basis of the current value of their land and not the 1940 value ( see paragraph 48 above ), and observed that this amendment had been made after the impugned expropriation, with the result that nobody else could have been subjected to the same treatment as themselves.

Whilst recognising that the national legislature had a wide margin of appreciation in matters of economic and social policy, they found that it was manifestly unreasonable in the present case to invoke a “public interest” when the measure had an exclusively commercial purpose. In this connection they observed that ultimately only the public domain had benefited from the transaction because it was the State, not themselves, that was now receiving rent in return for the use of the land by the company currently operating thereon – a situation that was of no benefit to any social group or society in general."

Moreover, they challenged the relevance of the example, given by the Government and referred to in the Chamber judgment, of the land expropriated for Riga ’ s international airport, observing that the situation in question was by no means comparable to their own. In this connection they argued that an airport fulfilled a public -service function that was clearly intended to satisfy the interests of various social groups, whereas the Free Port of Riga was akin to a large private corporation pursuing commercial aims. In addition, they argued that the land occupied by Riga Airport had in 1940 been exclusively agricultural and that its significant increase in value could be explained solely by the development of the airport infrastructure, whereas that of the expropriated land at issue was related more to its location and natural qualities. They observed that, unlike historical monuments, religious buildings or other real estate of similar kinds, their land did not form part of any cultural heritage in respect of which the State would be justified in arguing that there was a “public interest”."

In their submission, the sums that they had received in compensation, respectively over 1, 000 and 350 times lower than the cadastral value of the expropriated land at the time the expropriation procedure was initiated, were manifestly inadequate in relation to the actual value of the land in question. They compared their case to that of Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic ( no. 36548/97, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII), where compensation amounting to one-fifth of the expropriated property ’ s market value had been considered unacceptable."

They argued, however, that the amount of the compensation awarded by the State always had to remain reasonably related to the value of the expropriated land and that this had manifestly not been the case. In their submission, the State could not infringe this principle solely on the ground that the property had been acquired by donation. Moreover, it was incomprehensible that the 1940 cadastral value had been taken into account in the present case, and all the more illogical as the rent ceiling for land situated within the Free Port of Riga was based on the current cadastral value."

Firstly, disagreeing with the applicants ’ view, they asserted that the impugned measure had to be assessed in the general context of the land- reform legislation and the restitution of property illegally nationalised by the Soviet regime. In this connection, they referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 30 April 1998 finding that “[l]and reform is a continuous and complex process which does not end with the return of the real property concerned to the former owners or their heirs, but with the completion of the restructuring of legal, social and economic relations” ( see paragraph 61 above ), and to the Court ’ s settled case-law affording the State a particularly broad margin of appreciation in such contexts."

            [
                "82. Secondly, they argued that in assessing the compliance of the impugned measure with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 it was necessary to take into account Latvia ’ s economic situation during the first half of the 1990s, characterised as it was by a lack of sufficient budgetary resources following the radical change of political regime that the country had undergone. Like other central and eastern European States, during this transition period Latvia had initiated a real social and economic restructuring process that had led to a struggle with inflation, rising unemployment, poverty, general economic stagnation and an extremely serious banking crisis."

            [
                "83. As regards the lawfulness of the impugned expropriation, it was first necessary to look back at the history of land reform and denationalisation in Latvia. The initial wording of the Latvian Cities Land Reform Act had contained an anomaly, as it had allowed the restitution to former owners or their heirs of land occupied by infrastructure of strategic importance for the State that had been built over a half- century of Soviet administration. In order to resolve that problem the legislature had subsequently amended the initial wording of the Act such that former owners or their heirs who had not yet recovered their property were no longer able to have that type of land returned to them but would, however, be able to claim an equivalent plot of land or compensation."

Shortly afterwards, the legislature had been obliged to revise the legislation concerning the expropriation of real estate and the compensation mechanism applicable thereto, in order to eliminate discrepancies. Accordingly, on 19 December 1996 Parliament had amended Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 15 September 1992 by stipulating that compensation in cases of expropriation would not exceed the 1940 value of the expropriated property. In this connection, the Government pointed out that the State was free to amend existing legislation or to enact new laws in order to prevent any contradiction with other existing laws or to fill in any legal gaps in the latter, especially where the requisite amendments were made within the context of a complex and comprehensive land reform."

The Government then referred to the findings of the domestic courts to the effect that the Law of 30 October 1997, which had been applicable in the present case, could be regarded as a lex specialis derogating from the provisions of the General Expropriation Act. The law in question, which had been accessible to the applicants and perfectly foreseeable as to its effects, contained an express reference to Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision, as amended by the Law of 19 December 1996 and approved by the Constitutional Court. According to the Government, it was quite clear from that Article that land occupied by transport infrastructure, and, a fortiori, land acquired by way of donation, was subject to a specific expropriation procedure. Consequently, the applicants could reasonably have expected this specific procedure to be applied to them. Moreover, the provisions of the Law of 30 October 1997 had been rigorously adhered to by the authorities responsible for implementing them."

The aim of the law ’ s drafters had been to create a legal environment that ensured social justice, in particular for persons falling under the denationalisation scheme, without creating a disproportionate financial burden for the struggling State budget. Moreover, the legislation in question had remained in force well after the expropriation of the applicants ’ land, such that they were not justified in claiming that the relevant measure was specifically directed against them."

                "88. The Latvian authorities had struck a “fair balance” between the requirements of the general interest of the community and the applicants ’ fundamental rights in fixing the amount of compensation for the expropriation. The legislature had legitimately considered it necessary, in certain very specific cases, to limit the amount of compensation to the cadastral value of the relevant land at 22 July 1940. Such limitation had been applied on two occasions, first to the former owners of the twenty-three plots of land occupied by Riga Airport, then to Mr Vistiņš and Mr Perepjolkins. In 1940 the cadastral value of all the land in question had been minimal. It had only subsequently gained in value as a result of major investments to which its lawful owners had not contributed in any way, and after independence that value had been multiplied several times over. In those circumstances, the use of the 1940 cadastral value for the determination of compensation was not as such open to criticism as it corresponded to the general principle of public international law restitutio in integrum and was the result of careful consideration by the legislature."

Moreover, the applicants themselves had decided to indicate a minimal value for the land in the contracts of donation. Secondly, the applicants had not invested in the development of the land, and there was nothing to indicate that they had any plans for investment or property development that might increase its value. In those circumstances it had to be concluded that the applicants ’ sole intention was to enrich themselves at the expense of the State and society, with their sole “economic” activity consisting in receiving substantial rent arrears. Thirdly and lastly, the applicants had not paid any taxes in respect of the land. Accordingly, their situation was not comparable to that of the applicants in Pincová and Pinc ( cited above ), to which the applicants had referred. Instead, the Government were of the view that the present case was objectively on a par with that of Jahn and Others v. Germany ([GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI ), where, in the unique context of German reunification, the Court had accepted, on an exceptional basis, that the deprivation of property without compensation had been justified."

If the applicants had invested in the development of the land at issue – which was not the case – they could have sought reimbursement by challenging the amount of the compensation due to them in separate proceedings before the courts."

These rules are not, however, unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and are therefore to be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 78, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 48, 19 February 2009 )."

The Court must therefore ascertain whether the impugned deprivation was justified under that provision. To be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 an expropriation measure must fulfil three conditions: it must be carried out “subject to the conditions provided for by law”, which excludes any arbitrary action on the part of the national authorities, must be “in the public interest”, and must strike a fair balance between the owner ’ s rights and the interests of the community. The Court will examine whether each of those three conditions has been fulfilled in the present case.",

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is a notion inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC] (merits), no. 25701/94, § 79, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 147, ECHR 2004 ‑ V )."

In addition, the legal basis must have a certain quality, namely it must be compatible with the rule of law and must provide guarantees against arbitrariness. In this connection it should be pointed out that when speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term (see, for example, Špaček, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 54, 9 November 1999)."

Italy, no. 58858/00, §§ 82-83, 8 December 2005 ). As to the notion of “foreseeability”, its scope depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, mutatis mutandis, Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy, no. 75909/01, § 109, 20 January 2009). In particular, a rule is “foreseeable” when it affords a measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities ( see Centro Europa 7 S. r. 1. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 143, 7 June 2012 ). Similarly, the applicable law must provide minimum procedural safeguards commensurate with the importance of the principle at stake ( see, mutatis mutandis, Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, § 88, 14 September 2010 )."

The General Expropriation Act, enacted in 1923 and as applicable at the material time, subjected any expropriation of real estate to the following procedure : first the Government submitted to Parliament an expropriation proposal that had to satisfy certain criteria; then, on the basis of that proposal, Parliament enacted a special law ordering the expropriation of the property concerned; lastly, it was for the expropriating public authority to enter into negotiations with the owner for the purpose of reaching a friendly agreement as to the amount of the compensation, failing which the authority would refer the matter to the competent court for settlement of the dispute and determination of the final sum to be paid in compensation. The Court notes that the law which superseded the General Expropriation Act of 1923 retained the mechanism that applied where the State and the owner could not reach a friendly settlement ( see paragraph 5 2 above )."

Far from being specific to Latvia, the practice of expropriation by means of ad hominem laws ( see, in particular, Ruiz-Mateos, cited above, together with, mutatis mutandis, Gorraiz Lizarraga, cited above, § 58) is part of a nineteenth-century liberal tradition with the aim of ensuring the protection of ownership against abuse by the executive by subjecting any expropriation to parliamentary approval on a case-by-case basis. Illustrations of this can be found in section 3 of the French Public Interest Expropriation Act of 3 May 1841, which obliged the legislature to record in a special legislative instrument the public interest of any major public works, and in the Belgian laws of 17 April 1835 and 27 May 1870, under which the public interest of major public works had in some cases to be established by Parliament in the form of a statute. In its judgment of 16 December 2005 the Latvian Constitutional Court emphasised that this feature of Latvian expropriation law was protective of the right of ownership ( see paragraph 62 above ). In any event, the Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the domestic courts to rule on the constitutionality of domestic law ( see Jahn and Others, cited above, § 86). For its part, it finds that the general principles and objectives of the expropriation system set up by Latvian law do not, as such, raise any issue of “lawfulness” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In the present case, however, the Court notes that on 5 August 1997 the Cabinet, acting by virtue of its delegated legislative power, adopted Regulation no. 273 ordering the expropriation of all the properties at issue in the present case. That Regulation, together with the Law of 30 October 1997 by which it was confirmed, was interpreted by the domestic courts as providing for a derogation from the General Expropriation Act of 1923, making it possible to disregard the usual expropriation procedure in the case of the applicants and to limit the amount of the compensation by reference to Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 1992. Prior to the adoption of Regulation no. 273 and the enactment of the Law confirming it, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation of their property would be carried out in accordance with the 1923 General Expropriation Act. Admittedly, the special Law of 30 October 1997 was on a par with the 1923 Act in the legislative hierarchy and the applicants have never argued that, in Latvian constitutional law, Parliament cannot derogate from an ordinary law by a subsequent law of equal rank. For their part, the domestic courts found that the legal basis for the impugned expropriation was compliant with Latvian law."

In this connection, the Court reiterates that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Furthermore, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, § 87; James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98; and Beyeler v.

The Court has already held that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference. In many cases of lawful expropriation, such as a distinct taking of land for road construction or other “ public interest” purposes, only full compensation may be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property (see Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC] (just satisfaction), no. 25701/94, § 78, 28 November 2002; see also, mutatis mutandis, Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ II; and Efstathiou and Michailidis & Co.

Motel Amerika, cited above, § 29). As to the amount of the compensation, it must normally be calculated based on the value of the property at the date on which ownership thereof was lost.

Legitimate objectives of “public interest”, such as pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see James and Others, cited above, § 54); in such cases, the compensation does not necessarily have to reflect the full value of the property in question."

This principle applies all the more forcefully when laws are enacted in the context of a change of political and economic regime, especially during the initial transition period, which is necessarily marked by upheavals and uncertainties; in such cases the State has a particularly wide margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Jahn and Others, cited above, § 116 (a); and Suljagić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27912/02, § 42, 3 November 2009 ).

The Court reaffirmed that principle in Broniowski (cited above, § 182), in the context of a property restitution and compensation policy, specifying that a scheme to regulate property, being “wide-reaching but controversial ... with significant economic impact for the country as a whole”, could involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value. The Court has also reiterated these principles regarding the enactment of laws in “the exceptional context of German reunification” (see Maltzan and Others v. Germany (dec.)

The first estimation was made in 1994 when the land was acquired by the applicants in the form of a donation; the value indicated by the parties in the contracts of donation was LVL 500 or LVL 1,000 for each plot of land. The Court thus notes that the applicants themselves initially decided to assess their properties at an exceptionally low value and the parties agreed that this assessment was to be used solely for the calculation of the registration tax.

Slovakia, no. 74258/01, §§ 123 -124, 27 November 2007 ). In the Court ’ s view, such disproportionate awards are almost tantamount to a complete lack of compensation. As the Court has already indicated above, only very exceptional circumstances may justify such a situation. It is accordingly for the Court to ascertain whether such circumstances existed in the present case, by examining in turn the two points raised by the Government in this connection, namely the applicants ’ personal situations and conduct, together with the general historical and political background to the impugned measure."

Turkey, no. 37451/97, § 39, ECHR 2005 ‑ X ). Whilst the Government have appeared to call into question before the Court the circumstances in which the applicants became the owners of the land at issue, the Court finds that the Latvian authorities never took legal action to challenge the validity of the 1994 contracts of donation, whereas they could have done so based on the relevant provisions of the Civil Code ( see paragraph 59 above ). On the contrary, they formally recognised the applicants ’ right of ownership by registering the land in their names and by paying them rent. In those circumstances the Court does not find any reason to question the conformity of the donations with the requirements of Latvian law or the validity of the applicants ’ right of ownership."

It would therefore be incorrect, strictly speaking, to assert that the property in question was acquired “free of charge”. In any event, a donation being definable as a transaction entered into with an animus donandi, the manner in which the applicants acquired their property cannot be held against them (see paragraph 115 above). Similarly, whilst it is true that the applicants possessed their land for only about three years, that fact does not affect the value of the property and does not by itself justify a significant reduction in compensation. Consequently, the Court concludes that the applicants ’ personal circumstances and conduct did not in themselves justify the award of such minimal sums."

Even though the measure was not formally taken under the legislation on denationalisation or land and real- estate reform – which was removed from the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of the reservation made by Latvia ( see Kozlova and Smirnova v.

However, it finds that by the time of their expropriation, all the disputed plots of land had already, with final effect, been denationalised and allotted to individuals. In this connection, the Court cannot equate individuals who had not yet recovered their property with those who were already in possession of a valid title deed ( see, in this connection, Kopecký, cited above, §§ 53-61)."

The Court observes that the Government relied on its judgment in the case of Jahn and Others ( cited above ), but would point out that the latter concerned the rectification ex post facto, by legislation, of manifestly unfair situations that had been created by the property restitution process. The Court recognises that in that case it found, in view of the convincing social - justice reasons put forward by the national authorities in the exceptional context of German reunification, that the absence of compensation did not upset the “fair balance” to be struck between the protection of property and the requirements of the general interest (ibid. , § 117), but it would emphasise that it was the unique nature of the general political and legal context – and not simply the exceptional nature of the circumstances – that secured its acceptance of expropriation without compensation. In the Court ’ s view the background to the two cases is fundamentally different, in particular as regards the three points that led it to find that the Jahn and Others case was exceptional in nature (ibid. , § 116)."

            [
                "124. First, the circumstances of the enactment of the relevant legislation in the present case and in Jahn and Others are not really comparable. The Modrow Law at issue in Jahn and Others had been enacted by a parliament that had not been democratically elected, during a transitional period between two regimes that was inevitably marked by upheavals and uncertainties. In those circumstances, even if the applicants had acquired formal title, they could not be sure that their legal position would be maintained (ibid., § 116 (a)). However, in the present case the laws were enacted by a democratically elected parliament and there was no reason why the applicants could not maintain their rights, except in the event of fraudulent enrichment to the detriment of the former owners, but, as the Court has already noted, neither the validity of the contracts of donation nor the good faith of the applicants has been called into question by the Latvian authorities. In addition, unlike that of the applicants in the Jahn and Others case, the status of Mr Vistiņš and Mr Perepjolkins as property owners was unquestionably sound and the claims deriving from the enjoyment of their possessions had been further strengthened by the Free Commercial Port of Riga Act, which had subjected their land to profitable servitudes ( see paragraph 56 above )."
            ],
            [
                "125. Secondly, the time taken by the legislature is a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing proportionality (see Althoff and Others v. Germany, no. 5631/05, § 71, 8 December 2011 ). In the case of Jahn and Others a fairly short period of time (two years) had elapsed between German reunification and the enactment of the second Property Rights Amendment Act. Having regard to the huge task facing the German legislature when dealing with, among other things, all the complex issues relating to property rights raised by the transition to a democratic, market-economy regime, the Court acknowledged that it had intervened within a reasonable time to correct the – in its view, unjust – effects of the Modrow Law and that it could not be criticised for failing to realise the full effect of that Law on the very day on which German reunification had taken effect (ibid., § 116 (b)). In the present case, however, all the events at issue took place more than three years after the final re-entry into force of the democratic Constitution of 1922 and more than five years after the restoration of independence of Latvia, that is to say, well after the end of the period of historic upheaval (see, in this respect, Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § § 18-27, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ). It follows that, whilst it was still open to the Latvian legislature, in 1997, to correct any errors that may have been committed during the land reform, it could nevertheless be expected to uphold the principle of legal certainty and to refrain from imposing excessive burdens on individuals."
            ],
            [
                "126. Thirdly and lastly, in the case of Jahn and Others the objectives of the second Property Rights Amendment Act were legitimate, and the Court therefore recognised that the Federal Republic of Germany ’ s parliament could not be deemed to have been manifestly unreasonable in considering that it had a duty to correct the effects of the Modrow Law for reasons of social justice. Likewise, the balancing of the relevant interests carried out by the German Federal Constitutional Court, in examining the compatibility of that amending Law with the Basic Law, had not been arbitrary. Given the “windfall” from which the applicants had benefited as a result of the Modrow Law, the fact that the relevant correction had been made without paying any compensation was not disproportionate. In particular, the second Property Rights Amendment Act did not benefit the State alone, but in some cases also provided for the redistribution of land to farmers (ibid., § 116 (c)). By contrast, the Court questions whether “social justice” may be invoked in the present case, where the expropriation at issue was of benefit solely to the State, which did not redistribute any of the property to individuals."
            ],
            [
                "127. In sum, unlike the case of Jahn and Others, the present case is not one where a manifestly unjust situation that emerged in the process of denationalisation had to be remedied by the legislature ex post facto within a relatively short time in order to restore social justice. As the general context and the specific circumstances of the two cases are fundamentally different, the Jahn and Others judgment cannot usefully be relied upon to justify the lack of sufficient compensation observed in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "128. Moreover, the Court notes that shortly after being deprived of their property, the applicants received significant amounts from the Free Commercial Port of Riga for the rent arrears due to them and the servitudes to which their land was subjected. Those amounts – calculated this time on the basis of the current value, and not that of 1940 – were respectively 95 times higher than the compensation granted to the first applicant and 40 times higher than that granted to the second applicant. The Court, noting that the rent arrears due to the applicants derived from a separate legal basis from that of the compensation awarded to them, is unable to agree with the Government ’ s argument that the former sufficed to make up for the insignificance of the latter. In any event, the disproportion between the rent arrears and the compensation awarded confirms that the compensation was unreasonably low."
            ],
            [
                "129. Lastly, the Government failed to show that the legitimate aim relied on, namely that of optimising the management of the infrastructure of the Free Port of Riga in the general context of the State ’ s economic policy, could not be fulfilled by less drastic measures than expropriation compensated for by purely symbolic sums. Whilst the Court recognises that the Government are entitled to invoke the State ’ s budgetary difficulties, these do not, however, constitute an imperative capable of justifying the adoption of such exceptional measures. In principle, it is not for the Court to indicate to the Contracting Parties what concrete legislative or regulatory measures should be taken in order to comply with their obligations. That being said, an exchange of land or a reduction in the rent due to the applicants – for as long as the State did not have the requisite budgetary resources to expropriate their land in return for fair compensation – are readily conceivable examples of such measures. Furthermore, the authorities could have calculated the compensation on the basis of the cadastral value of the land at the date on which the applicants had actually lost their title instead of using the cadastral value from 1940 ( see Guiso-Gallisay (just satisfaction) [GC], cited above, § 103). However, there is no evidence in the file that such measures were discussed or even envisaged at national level."

In those circumstances, even though Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not, in the present case, require the reimbursement of the full cadastral or market value of the expropriated properties, the Court finds that the disproportion between their current cadastral value and the compensation awarded – resulting, moreover, from a retrospective legislative amendment which created an inequality to the State ’ s advantage and to the applicants ’ disadvantage – is too significant for it to find that a “fair balance” was struck between the interests of the community and the applicants ’ fundamental rights ( see, mutatis mutandis, Urbárska Obec Trenčianske Biskupice, cited above, § 126, and Althoff, cited above, § 73)."

It has not been established, or even alleged by the applicants moreover, that the undrained portion of this land had ever been removed from the action of the tide. The investigation shows, moreover, that the dyke is the result of land draining carried out prior to the entry into force of the above- mentioned Act of 28 November 1963 [ the Maritime Public Property Act] ... and that, notwithstanding the various authorisations of temporary occupancy granted by the authorities, as this was not done in the manner prescribed for concessions for the construction of a dyke it has not had the effect of bringing this part of the land thus removed from the action of the tide outside the category of maritime public property. In accordance with the principles of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property, the submissions by Mr and Mrs Depalle to the effect that the house was built legally and its occupancy accepted by the authorities for a very long time and tolerated even after expiry of the last authorisation to occupy it do not alter the fact that the property falls within the category of maritime public property.",

In the absence, since that date, of a lawful title of occupancy, the prefect of Morbihan is justified in requesting an order against the occupants to restore the site – if they have not already done so – to its original state prior to construction of the house on maritime public property. In disputing that obligation, the applicants cannot properly rely on the long period of occupancy of the premises or on the fact that the authorities have tolerated the continuation of that occupancy since 31 December 1992 and proposed draft occupancy agreements in order to regularise the situation, which, moreover, they have not taken up. ...",

                "The prefect of Morbihan based his decision not to grant Mr and Mrs Depalle the requested concession to build a dyke on the guidelines set out in the circular of 3 January 1973 issued by the Minister for Economic Affairs and the Minister for Regional Development on the use of public property other than commercial or fishing ports.

Accordingly, as stated above, the plot of land in question is State-owned public property. There is no evidence in the case that the prefect, before reaching his decision, either failed to examine the particular circumstances of Mr and Mrs Depalle ’ s request or made a manifest error of assessment in concluding that there was no special feature or general-interest consideration in the case justifying an exemption from the above-mentioned rules. ”"

The principle of inalienability of public land, which was established in the case-law and then incorporated into the Code of State Property (Article L. 52) and the CGPPP ( Article L. 3111-1), is inextricably linked to the notion of public land. The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use. As long as it remains thus designated, and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property, no transfer of land can be authorised. It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law, hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability. Accordingly, in its Cazeaux judgment, on the subject of plots of land situated close to the seashore in the Arcachon Basin, the Conseil d ’ Etat found :",
                "“ ... while the public authorities have authorised various building works on this land and on several occasions waived their right to apply the rules governing public land ..., neither the founders of the société du domaine des prés salés nor the company itself have been able to acquire any property right over the land, which, being part of public land, was inalienable and imprescriptible ... ”"

The Constitutional Council has stated that inalienability is limited to precluding the transfer of public property that has not first been reclassified as private property (CC, no. 86-217 DC of 18 September 1986, Freedom of communication ). It has not, however, recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status (CC, dec. no. 94-346 of 21 July 1994, Rights in rem over public property ). The Conseil d ’ Etat has recently reiterated that “ where property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus, it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property”. Accordingly, it has held that the question whether or not short-stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact “ that these short-stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private-law contracts” (CE, Société Lucofer, 26 March 2008 )."

The effect of the principle of inalienability is that any transfer of public land that has not been “reclassified” is null and void, so third-party purchasers have a duty to return the land even if they have purchased it in good faith. Moreover, the fact that public land is inalienable means – in theory – that no rights in rem can be established over it. However, the legislature has departed from this principle by passing two Acts, one of 5 January 1988 which creates long administrative leases, and the other of 25 July 1994 on the constitution of rights in rem over public land, thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property. The Act of 5 January 1988 concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof. The Act of 25 July 1994 relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity (Article L. 34-1 of the Code of State Property and Article L. 2122-6 of the CGPPP). In its above-mentioned decision of 21 July 1994, the Constitutional Council held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the Constitution as public services were maintained and public property protected under the Act of 25 July 1994. However, it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond seventy years unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority ’ s right to the automatic return, free of charge, of any constructions and therefore undermine the “ protection due to public property”."

The conditions of occupation of public property are determined either in unilateral concessions granted by the authorities (of the type referred to above in Article L. 28 of the Code of State Property ) or in contracts signed with the occupant. The latter are called concessions to occupy public land, which – on maritime public property – may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke. By means of this concession, the State authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide. In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in 1807, traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred (former Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property): the concessionaire was authorised to drain land, which, once removed from the action of the tide, no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the State. That arrangement, which was originally used to build agricultural polders, has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas, reclaimed from the sea. Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore, a circular was issued in 1973 prohibiting such arrangements – a prohibition later confirmed by the Coastal Areas Act, which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore. It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred. This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these ( source: www.mer.gouv.fr, consulted on 3 February 2010 )."

Awareness of the economic importance of the seashore and of the degree to which it is coveted made it necessary to introduce a rule of overriding legal force that would arbitrate between the many uses of coastal areas. It is in this spirit that the Coastal Areas Act of 3 January 19 86 (consolidated on 7 August 2007) was unanimously passed by Parliament. Section 1 of the Act provides that coastal areas are “ geographical entities which call for a specific policy of development, protection and enhancement ”.

In all these States maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed-term concessions. And in all these States illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties. In particular, the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation. This type of measure also exists in Sweden, where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea."

Having been kept in the dark for a long time about the possible demolition of his house, the applicant referred to the decades spent peacefully in a strong social and family environment.

According to the Government, the house was an insuperable obstacle to the public right of way. Restoring the land to its original state would reinstate public access to maritime property and to a site listed in the local land- user plan under a zoning system for the protection of specific natural areas."

The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which guarantees in substance the right of property, comprises three distinct rules (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98): the first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, are to be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see Bruncrona v. Finland, no. 41673/98, §§ 65-69, 16 November 2004, and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 134, ECHR 2004-V)."

Regarding whether or not there has been an interference, the Court reiterates that, in determining whether there has been a deprivation of possessions within the second “rule”, it is necessary not only to consider whether there has been a formal taking or expropriation of property but to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective”, it has to be ascertained whether the situation amounted to a de facto expropriation ( see Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, § 76, ECHR 1999 -VII, and Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, §§ 63 and 69-74, Series A no. 52)."

Malta, no. 4251/02, §§ 34 ‑ 35, 8 November 2005; by contrast, Allard v. Sweden, no. 35179/97, § 50, ECHR 2003 -VII, and N.A. and Others, cited above, §§ 31 and 38)."

The Court considers that the non-renewal of the decisions authorising private occupancy of the public property, which the applicant must have anticipated would one day affect him, and the resulting order to demolish the house can be analysed as control of the use of property in accordance with the general interest. Indeed, the rules governing public property, in so far as they designate it as being for public use, fall into this category. Furthermore, the reasons given by the prefect for refusing to renew authorisation were based on the provisions of the Coastal Areas Act relating to the protection of the natural state of the seashore ( see, mutatis mutandis, Hamer, cited above, § 77)."
            ],
            [
                "81. The Court cannot agree with the applicant ’ s submission that the aim of the interference was not in the general interest, namely, the protection of the property ’ s designation as public property and of the environment. It accepts that the domestic courts analysed the interference with the property in question only from the standpoint of its classification as public property. It observes, further, that by issuing successive decisions authorising occupancy, the State de facto weakened the protection of the property ’ s designation as land for the benefit of the public. However, it is since the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act – section 1 of which provides that “ the coast is a geographical entity that requires a specific development, conservation and enhancement policy ” – that authorisations have no longer been renewed, with the aim of protecting the seashore and more generally the environment. The Court reiterates that environmental conservation, which in today ’ s society is an increasingly important consideration ( see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), 18 February 1991, § 48, Series A no. 192), has become a cause whose defence arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and consequently the public authorities. The Court has stressed this point a number of times with regard to the protection of the countryside and forests ( see Turgut and Others, cited above, § 90; Köktepe, cited above, § 87; and Şatır, cited above, § 33). The protection of coastal areas, and in particular beaches, which are “ a public area open to all”, is another example ( see N.A. and Others, cited above, § 40) of an area where an appropriate planning policy is required. The Court therefore considers that the interference pursued a legitimate aim that was in the general interest: to promote unrestricted access to the shore, the importance of which has been clearly established ( see paragraphs 46 - 49 and 51 and 54 above )."

                "83. According to well-established case-law, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is to be read in the light of the principle enunciated in the first sentence. Consequently, an interference must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999 - III). The requisite balance will not be achieved if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden."

The Court has, moreover, often reiterated that regional planning and environmental conservation policies, where the community ’ s general interest is pre-eminent, confer on the State a margin of appreciation that is greater than when exclusively civil rights are at stake ( see, mutatis mutandis, Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, § 70, ECHR 2004-III; Alatulkkila and Others v. Finland, no. 33538/96, § 67, 28 July 2005; Valico S.r.l. v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 70074/01, ECHR 2006- III; and Fägerskiöld v.

                "85. The Court observes that the applicant did not build the house himself but purchased it by notarial deed in 1960 (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above). Since then he has occupied and maintained the house, and paid the taxes and charges on it. The Court also observes that the house was apparently built over a century ago on public land drained for that purpose without any concession authorising the construction (see paragraph 24 above). In the Court ’ s view, the question of whether the house was legally built should not be a matter for consideration in the present case. In any event, the alleged illegality of the building should not be held against the applicant, particularly as it is not disputed that he acquired his “possession” in good faith. His situation is therefore clearly different from that of an individual who has knowingly erected a building without a permit (see, by contrast, Öneryıldız; Saliba; and Hamer, all cited above). The house in question is not therefore comparable with those that have recently been illegally built along the coast."
            ],
            [
                "86. At all events, since the applicant purchased the “ possession ”, or possibly even since it was built, the authorities have been aware of the existence of the house because it has been occupied on the basis of a decision authorising occupancy which specified that “the dyke cannot interfere in any way with navigation rights ... or maritime coastal traffic on condition that it is accessible to the public at all times”. Each prefectoral decision authorising occupancy specified the length of the authorisation and, in accordance with former Article A 26 of the Code of State Property, that the authorities could modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary, on any ground whatsoever, without the permittee thereby acquiring any right to claim compensation. Furthermore, it was specified that the permittee must, if required, restore the site to its original state by demolishing the constructions built on the public property, including those existing on the date on which the decision was signed. The Court concludes from this that the applicant had always known that the decisions authorising occupancy were precarious and revocable and considers that the authorities cannot therefore be deemed to have contributed to maintaining uncertainty regarding the legal status of the “possession” (see, by contrast, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 119, ECHR 2000- I ).",
                "Admittedly, the applicant has had peaceful enjoyment of the “possession” for a long time. The Court does not, however, see any negligence on the part of the authorities, but rather tolerance of the ongoing occupancy, which has, moreover, been subject to certain rules. Accordingly, there is no evidence to support the applicant ’ s suggestion that the authorities ’ responsibility for the uncertainty regarding the status of the house increased with the passage of time ( see paragraph 60 above ). The exceptional length of the occupancy and certain hesitations on the part of the authorities ( see paragraphs 14 and 29 above ) should be viewed in the context at the relevant time, when development and environmental concerns had not yet reached the degree witnessed today. It was not until 1986 that the applicant ’ s situation changed, following the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act which put an end to a policy of protecting coastal areas merely by applying the rules governing public property. In any event, the above - mentioned tolerance could not result in a legalisation ex post facto of the status quo."

The Court notes the applicant ’ s submission that the measure was not appropriate to the general-interest aim of protecting coastal areas and that the house was perfectly integrated into the landscape, was even part of the national heritage and did not impede access to the shore. The Court reiterates in this connection, however, that it is first and foremost for the national authorities to decide which type of measures should be imposed to protect coastal areas. These will depend on urban and regional planning policies, which are, by definition, evolutive, and are, par excellence, spheres in which the State intervenes, particularly through control of property in the general or public interest (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others, cited above, § 70, and Galtieri v.

It is true that in the past the authorities were perhaps less strict about private occupancy of public land. Furthermore, prior to the Coastal Areas Act, the applicant did not request a concession to build a dyke at a time when he could perhaps still have done so. However, the State started reacting as early as 1973 to the risk of public property being used for private ends ( see paragraph 43 above)."

The refusal to renew authorisation of occupancy and the measure ordering the applicant to restore the site to its condition prior to the construction of the house correspond to a concern to apply the law consistently and more strictly, having regard to the increasing need to protect coastal areas and their use by the public, but also to ensure compliance with planning regulations. Having regard to the appeal of the coast and the degree to which it is coveted, the need for planning control and unrestricted public access to the coast makes it necessary to adopt a firmer policy of management of this part of the country. The same is true of all European coastal areas.",

Moreover, the applicant has not provided proof of any inconsistency on the part of the authorities in applying such a policy, either by showing that neighbours in a similar situation have been exempted from the obligation to demolish their house or by referring to any overriding higher interest, be it architectural and /or dictated by a concern to protect the national heritage."

The Court shares the opinion of the Government Commissioner of the Conseil d ’ Etat that the proposal in question could have provided a solution reconciling the competing interests ( see paragraph 27 above ). It did not seem an unreasonable offer, having regard to the length of the occupancy and the applicant ’ s “ sentimental attachment ” to the house and the time sometimes required to implement an Act. The same solution has, moreover, been adopted when implementing recent coastal laws in other coastal countries (see, for example, Spain, paragraph 53 above)."

Greece, no. 35332/05, § 45, 21 February 2008). In the instant case, having regard to the rules governing public property, and considering that the applicant could not have been unaware of the principle that no compensation was payable, which was clearly stated in every decision issued since 1961 authorising his temporary occupancy of the public property (see paragraph 14 above ), the lack of compensation cannot, in the Court ’ s view, be regarded as a measure disproportionate to control of the use of the applicant ’ s property, carried out in pursuit of the general interest."

The Court considers that the situation of which the applicants complain falls to be dealt with under the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 because the impugned measures undoubtedly restricted the applicants’ rights to use their possessions."

It could be argued, of course, that they cannot complain about the building freeze between 13 September 1987 and 1 March 1988 because they could have obtained the annulment of the prefect’s decision of 31 July 1987 (although the Government do not plead non-exhaustion in this respect, the failure of the applicants to use appropriate procedures to defend their rights can influence the merits, see the above-mentioned Katte Klitsche de la Grange v.

On 1 March 1988 the applicant’s property was expropriated and on 16 November 1989 the First Instance Court of Athens fixed provisionally the amount of the relevant compensation. However, as compensation was not paid within the time-limits provided for by law, the Court of Appeal of Athens declared the Prefect’s decision concerning the expropriation revoked ipso jure on 8 November 1991. On 21 May 1990 the Prefect amended the town plan of Neo Psihiko and this amendment was considered to amount to a new expropriation. On 19 August 1993 a fresh expropriation was ordered, which would have been in accordance with the Convention, if the applicants had been paid adequate compensation. This involved allowing the applicants use of the underground area of their plot for the construction of a carpark and compensation for the use of the surface which would have been transformed into a parking building (see paragraph 25 above). However, that alternative fell through and the applicants remained deprived of the use of their plot, having also regard to the events and the attitude of the competent authorities since 9 July 1997 (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 44 above)."

This principle is of even greater importance in the context of administrative proceedings concerning a dispute whose outcome is decisive for a litigant’s civil rights. By lodging an application for judicial review with the State’s highest administrative court the litigant seeks not only annulment of the impugned decision but also and above all the removal of its effects. The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities’ part to comply with a judgment of that court. The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice. Where administrative authorities refuse or fail to comply, or even delay doing so, the guarantees under Article 6 enjoyed by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose (judgment of Hornsby v. Greece of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ II, §§ 40 ‑ 41)."

As a result, the Court considers that, despite the two subsequent expropriations, the first expropriation still remains in force not having been officially revoked by the Prefecture.

They contended that they had lost the possibility of selling their properties at normal market prices. They added that they would have run too great a risk had they incurred expenditure on their properties and that if all the same they had had work carried out after obtaining a building permit, they would have been obliged to undertake not to claim - in the event of expropriation - any indemnity for the resultant capital appreciation.

Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are \"practical and effective\" (see the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 12, par. 24), it has to be ascertained whether that situation amounted to a de facto expropriation, as was argued by the applicants.",

The Court notes in this connection that the permits granted to the City of Stockholm were granted for five years in the case of the Sporrong Estate - with an extension for three, then for five and finally for ten years - and for ten years in the case of Mrs. Lönnroth. In the events that happened, they remained in force for twenty-three years and eight years respectively. During the whole of this period, the applicants were left in complete uncertainty as to the fate of their properties and were not entitled to have any difficulties which they might have encountered taken into account by the Swedish Government. The Commission ’ s report furnishes an example of such difficulties. Mrs. Lönnroth had requested the Government to withdraw the expropriation permit. The City Council replied that the existing plans did not authorise any derogation; the Government, for their part, refused the request on the ground that they could not revoke the permit without the Council ’ s express consent (see paragraph 21 above).",

                "71. The Court notes that as in Apap Bologna, cited above, and Portanier v. Malta (no. 55747/16, 27 August 2019), in the present case the constitutional jurisdictions and in particular the Constitutional Court did not order the eviction of the tenant. There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 67 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the case ‑ law relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the first ‑ instance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., § 86)."
            ],
            [
                "72. In Apap Bologna, § 88, the Court, noting that it was not for it to interpret domestic law, also expressed regret at the interpretation given by the constitutional jurisdictions as to their impossibility of awarding a higher future rent. According to the Court, such an order would constitute a measure vis ‑ à ‑ vis an individual applicant, which would provide for an end to the violation without affecting the tenant. The same was reiterated in the more recent Portanier judgment, § 48, which noted that this course of action has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, and where the Court reiterated that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite the less weighty legitimate aim, an adequate future rent in the light of that aim, could nonetheless bring the violation to an end. Moreover, the future rent would have had to be established only until 2028 date when the lease will no longer be protected under Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court did not take that approach."
            ],
            [
                "73. The Court notes that in the present case, while none of the above actions were taken, the Constitutional Court took an alternative action. It ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law provisions to retain title to the property. From the domestic case ‑ law brought to the Court ’ s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become customary, at least since 2016. In Portanier the Court maintained that it still had doubts as to this approach, and reiterated its reservations about the fact that the Constitutional Court, whose role is to bring a violation to an end and to redress the upheld violation, abdicates the responsibility assigned to it by the Constitution of Malta and refers applicants to yet another remedy despite it having the power and authority to grant such redress ( § 51). In that case, while having set out a number of considerations, in view of the parties ’ limited submissions and the fact that the applicant had been successful in evicting the tenants, the Court refrained from adjudicating on the effectiveness of that approach in general ( §§ 52 ‑ 54). Similar considerations apply in the present case in relation to the parties ’ limited submissions, and for, inter alia, those same reasons the Court will refrain from adjudicating on the matter in general. The Court will however adjudicate on the effectiveness of such a measure in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "74. Firstly, the Court notes that it has not been informed that eviction proceedings were undertaken and if so that they have been concluded. Nor has the Court been informed that the tenants have voluntarily vacated the property since they now (as a result of the Constitutional Court judgment) no longer have title to it (in the absence of the relevant protection of law). It follows that the inaction of both parties has led to the status quo remaining that which existed on the date of the Constitutional Court judgment, more than three years ago. In this connection the Court makes reference to its case ‑ law to the effect that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction ( Musci v. Italy [GC], no. 64699/01, § 90 ECHR 2006 ‑ V (extracts)). That reasoning appears to be relevant to the situation in the present case, and echoes the concerns expressed by the Court in Portanier concerning a further set of eviction proceedings."

            [
                "75. However, leaving that matter open, the Court notes that, unlike the situation in other similar cases against Malta where the interferences had been justified by the legitimate aim of providing social housing, in the present case the interference applied in favour of a commercial entity, namely a bank. Moreover, as the law stood at the time of the Constitutional Court proceedings, the bank would in any event lose the protection of the law and therefore would have to vacate the property when the lease comes to an end in 2028. It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, there seems to be no particular justification for delaying redress and continuing to perpetrate the violation established. Thus, in the absence of an award covering future rent until 2028, the Court considers that the only remedy capable of giving adequate and speedy redress to the applicants in the situation of the present case was for the Constitutional Court to order eviction – a course of action it failed to undertake, as is its normal practice (see paragraph 71 above)."

The Court reiterates that, just like an award for pecuniary damage under Article 41 of the Convention, an award for pecuniary damage made by a domestic court must be intended to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have enjoyed had the breach not occurred. It transpires from the information and cases brought before the Court that this is often not the case. Such pecuniary awards are also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non-pecuniary damage and/or an order for the payment of the relevant costs (ibid. § 90 and Grech and Others, cited above, § 62). No domestic case-law dispelling such conclusions has been brought to the Court ’ s attention in the present case."

Malta (no. 55747/16, 27 August 2019), in the present case the constitutional jurisdictions and in particular the Constitutional Court did not order the eviction of the tenant. There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 67 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the case ‑ law relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the first ‑ instance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., § 86)."

In Apap Bologna, § 88, the Court, noting that it was not for it to interpret domestic law, also expressed regret at the interpretation given by the constitutional jurisdictions as to their impossibility of awarding a higher future rent. According to the Court, such an order would constitute a measure vis ‑ à ‑ vis an individual applicant, which would provide for an end to the violation without affecting the tenant. The same was reiterated in the more recent Portanier judgment, § 48, which noted that this course of action has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, and where the Court reiterated that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite the less weighty legitimate aim, an adequate future rent in the light of that aim, could nonetheless bring the violation to an end. Moreover, the future rent would have had to be established only until 2028 date when the lease will no longer be protected under Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court did not take that approach."

It ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law provisions to retain title to the property. From the domestic case ‑ law brought to the Court ’ s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become customary, at least since 2016. In Portanier the Court maintained that it still had doubts as to this approach, and reiterated its reservations about the fact that the Constitutional Court, whose role is to bring a violation to an end and to redress the upheld violation, abdicates the responsibility assigned to it by the Constitution of Malta and refers applicants to yet another remedy despite it having the power and authority to grant such redress ( § 51). In that case, while having set out a number of considerations, in view of the parties ’ limited submissions and the fact that the applicant had been successful in evicting the tenants, the Court refrained from adjudicating on the effectiveness of that approach in general ( §§ 52 ‑ 54). Similar considerations apply in the present case in relation to the parties ’ limited submissions, and for, inter alia, those same reasons the Court will refrain from adjudicating on the matter in general. The Court will however adjudicate on the effectiveness of such a measure in the present case."

                "74. Firstly, the Court notes that it has not been informed that eviction proceedings were undertaken and if so that they have been concluded. Nor has the Court been informed that the tenants have voluntarily vacated the property since they now (as a result of the Constitutional Court judgment) no longer have title to it (in the absence of the relevant protection of law). It follows that the inaction of both parties has led to the status quo remaining that which existed on the date of the Constitutional Court judgment, more than three years ago. In this connection the Court makes reference to its case ‑ law to the effect that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction ( Musci v. Italy [GC], no. 64699/01, § 90 ECHR 2006 ‑ V (extracts)). That reasoning appears to be relevant to the situation in the present case, and echoes the concerns expressed by the Court in Portanier concerning a further set of eviction proceedings."

However, leaving that matter open, the Court notes that, unlike the situation in other similar cases against Malta where the interferences had been justified by the legitimate aim of providing social housing, in the present case the interference applied in favour of a commercial entity, namely a bank. Moreover, as the law stood at the time of the Constitutional Court proceedings, the bank would in any event lose the protection of the law and therefore would have to vacate the property when the lease comes to an end in 2028. It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, there seems to be no particular justification for delaying redress and continuing to perpetrate the violation established. Thus, in the absence of an award covering future rent until 2028, the Court considers that the only remedy capable of giving adequate and speedy redress to the applicants in the situation of the present case was for the Constitutional Court to order eviction – a course of action it failed to undertake, as is its normal practice (see paragraph 71 above)."

The Court reiterates that, just like an award for pecuniary damage under Article 41 of the Convention, an award for pecuniary damage made by a domestic court must be intended to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have enjoyed had the breach not occurred. It transpires from the information and cases brought before the Court that this is often not the case. Such pecuniary awards are also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non-pecuniary damage and/or an order for the payment of the relevant costs (ibid. § 90 and Grech and Others, cited above, § 62).

In the light of the above considerations, the Court concludes that although constitutional redress proceedings are an effective remedy in theory, they are not so in practice, in cases such as the present one.

As regards length-of-proceedings cases, the Court reiterates that a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 183, ECHR 2006 ‑ V). However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective. The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria are as follows:",
                "– an action for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time;",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable;",

                "– the rules regarding legal costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified;",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Valada Matos das Neves v. Portugal, no. 73798/13, § 73, 29 October 2015, and Brudan v. Romania, no. 75717/14, § 69, 10 April 2018 )."

                "83. On this last criterion, the Court indicated that, with regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine the existence and quantum. The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There is a strong, although rebuttable, presumption in favour of non-pecuniary damage being occasioned by the excessive length of proceedings. However, there may also be situations where no such damage, or only minimal damage, has been ascertained – for instance where an applicant ’ s conduct has entirely or partly caused the procrastination or where the delay has been caused by circumstances independent of the authorities (see Rutkowski and Others v. Poland, nos. 72287/10 and 2 others, § 182, 7 July 2015, and the case ‑ law cited therein )."

Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore that it has repeatedly found (in the context of cases relating to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) that compensation awards are reduced or even absorbed by an order for the payment of costs (see, as recent examples, Zammit and Vassallo v. Malta, no. 43675/16, § 42, 28 May 2019, and Portanier, cited above, § 55 ). The same occurred in the present case, where in proceedings where the applicants ’ claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 in connection with the length of proceedings were upheld, the Constitutional Court nevertheless ordered the applicants to pay 3/5 of the costs of the proceedings (see paragraph 25 above). Thus, while it has not been argued that such costs impede access to such a remedy, they, at the very least, often have an impact on the compensation awarded."
            ],
            [
                "87. The Court observes that there existed no limit on the amount of compensation which could be granted to an applicant in such proceedings. The redress to be awarded is based solely on the exercise by the domestic court judges ’ of their discretion as to what might constitute appropriate pecuniary redress in the circumstances of the particular case. The mere fact that an amount of compensation awarded is low, or that no amount is awarded at all, does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court ’ s assessment of the applicant ’ s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, and Śliwiński v. Poland, no. 40063/06, § 36, 5 January 2010 respectively). In the present case the Constitutional Court denied the applicants any compensation whatsoever without giving sufficient reasons ( see paragraph 47 - 48 above). Moreover, the two cases relied on by the applicants and one of the cases put forward by the Government, as well as the applicants ’ own case, suggest that the Maltese Constitutional Court far too often fails to award any compensation at all for such breaches. Even when they do make an award, the cases brought forward by the Government indicate that the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap Bologna, cited above, § 89, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases ). Indeed, the Court observes that in around two thirds of the cases relied on by the Government the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40 % of the amount), or even manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 2 and 5 % of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, or even no compensation at all, as happened in the present case."

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 123, 10 September 2010, and the case ‑ law cited therein ). In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that the parties have not elaborated on this matter.

It has also considered the legitimate purpose of the restriction suffered, bearing in mind that legitimate objectives in the “public interest”, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see, inter alia, Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, § 18 and 20, 17 July 2008). In the present case however, the Court keeps in mind that the property was not used for securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (compare, Fleri Soler and Camilleri v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 35349/05, § 18, 17 July 2008).

The Secretary of State informed the applicant that the refusal was the result of an ‘error in processing’ by the local authority where the fact that the applicant’s home had been specially adapted was not taken into account when the decision to refuse DHP was made."

It considered that the relevant Regulations did discriminate against those who had a need to occupy accommodation with a greater number of bedrooms than they were entitled to because of their own disability or that of a family or household member. However, they considered that there was no “precise class of persons” who could be identified as affected by the measure, by reason of their disability. Moreover, such discrimination would only breach Article 14 taken together with Article 8 and/or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention, if it were “manifestly without reasonable foundation”, and that test was not satisfied in the case."

The Court of Appeal considered whether it should be classified as direct or indirect discrimination although in its view the type of discrimination was not material in light of the Strasbourg case-law.

First, because the applicant did not form a very limited class, and to include an imprecise class to whom the Regulations would not apply would introduce more complexity into the assessment and be administratively intensive and costly. Second, discretionary payments were suitable to deal with disability-related needs as they can be imposed for shorter periods and demanded more rigorous financial discipline from local authorities. Third, the Secretary of State was entitled to take the view that there were certain groups of persons whose needs for assistance with payment of their rent are better dealt with by discretionary payments rather than Housing Benefits."

It concluded that the Regulations were prima facie discriminatory on grounds of gender but that the discrimination was justified. In its judgment, the High Court examined the system of Sanctuary Schemes, summarised as follows:",
                "A Sanctuary Scheme provides for the adaption of a property to make it secure. In particular there may be a secured room or space. The safe room provides a place to which the person can retreat if violence occurs or they are in fear of attack whilst they call the police and wait for assistance. The address is ‘tagged’ on police computer systems to ensure a quick response to a 999 call or the activation of a panic button. Specialist, tailored support is also provided, and A has (what is termed) a \"complex package of multi-agency support\".",
                "10. These Schemes have been successfully established across the country since 2006. Even a brief explanation of their aims and scope are sufficient to demonstrate what a good idea they are. One of the obvious benefits is that victims of domestic violence and the like can remain in their own homes (if they want to) rather than being forced out by the fear of violence. Leaving their home as a result of domestic violence can have serious consequences for the stability of their lives. Government statutory homelessness statistics show that domestic violence is consistently reported as the main reason for the loss of a last settled home for 12-13% of homelessness acceptances in England; see the witness statement of [ P.N.] of Women’s Aid at [C4]. [the applicant’s representative] submitted that Sanctuary Schemes are a means of homelessness prevention. Whilst the work costs money, it avoids the expense and upheaval of re-housing and (as A’s case well illustrates) of losing the support network of friends and neighbours that takes years to build up and which is so important for the continued safety and general wellbeing of people in A’s position. It is these people who help provide her with the day to day friendship and sense of community that she needs.",
                "16. None of that is particularly controversial. However, there is one further piece of evidence provided by the replies to these requests which was the subject of some argument. Local authorities were asked for the number of households in Sanctuary Schemes affected by the under-occupancy provisions. The answer was 120. The average gap in funding was £16.70 per week (above the average figure). Of that group of 120, the number receiving DHPs was 24 (or 20%). The Claimant relies upon that statistic to show that DHPs are not being provided to 80% of households in Sanctuary Schemes which are affected by these regulations and who should be receiving DHPs. The Defendant says that it proves nothing of the sort. [...] I observed during the course of argument that I would need to know more about the 80% before I could draw any conclusions from these figures. That remains my view. The statistic shows that DHPs are being paid to people in Sanctuary Schemes. Indeed that is A’s experience. What we do not know is why they are not being paid. It may be that it is because applications are being refused. Or it may be because claimants are bridging the gap in other ways.”"

It cannot seriously be disputed that A and those in a similar position, who are within the Sanctuary Schemes and in need of an adapted \"safe\" room, are few in number and capable of easy recognition. There would be little prospect of abuse by including them within the defined categories in Regulation B13 and little need for monitoring. Moreover, with careful drafting, Regulation B13 could be amended to identify them as a discernible and certain class.",

We acknowledge in particular that DHPs are discretionary, but that that discretion has to be exercised lawfully and in accordance with the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. If they were to be withheld inappropriately, the decision would be subject to review. We acknowledge that the evidence shows that the DHPs would cover the full deficit in Housing Benefit. We acknowledge that, even though the fund for DHPs is capped and may in theory be insufficient, there is no clear evidence that it will be; on the contrary, so far it has been sufficient. Thus, the evidence is that A has received what she would have received had those in her position been brought within a defined class in Regulation B13; she has not been disadvantaged. But that was the position in Burnip, and the same justification was not accepted.",

I leave aside the question debated in the evidence about whether some people in a sanctuary scheme might safely be able to make use of a spare room by taking in someone else such as a family member. Likewise I do not suppose that there would be insuperable practical difficulties in drafting exemptions to meet other categories of people who may justifiably claim to have a need to remain where they are for reasons unconnected with the size of the accommodation, but this would again require an evaluative process. ”"

Reducing her Housing Benefit by reference to the number of bedrooms puts at risk her ability to stay there. Because of its special character, it will be difficult if not impossible for her to move elsewhere and that would certainly put the State to yet further expense. Given these very special circumstances, I am tempted to regard this as an interference with her and her son’s right to respect for their home. But in any event, denying her the benefit she needs in order to be able to stay there is discrimination in the sense described in Thlimmenos v Greece 31 EHRR 15: treating her like any other single parent with one child when in fact she ought to be treated differently.",

The Secretary of State accepts that she needs to stay in a Sanctuary Scheme and probably in this very house.

But if the discretionary housing payment scheme is not good enough to justify the discrimination against the [other] households, it is not good enough to justify the discrimination against Ms A’s household either. Its deficiencies were acknowledged in the Court of Appeal’s decision in Burnip v Birmingham City Council [2012] EWCA Civ 629; [2013] PTSR 117, para 46. They are well-summed up by Mr Drabble QC [...]: it is discretionary, cash-limited and produces less certainty; it has a stricter means test; it offers different and less attractive routes of judicial challenge; it can be onerous to make applications; and it encourages short term, temporary and conditional awards. For a woman in a Sanctuary Scheme to have to endure all those difficulties and uncertainties on top of the constant fear and anxiety in which she lives cannot be justified. This is not a question of the allocation of scarce public resources: it is rightly acknowledged that public resources will have to meet this need one way or another.”"

The Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay and Hooper LJJ and Henderson J) held that the claimants had established a prima facie case of discrimination under Article 14 of the ECHR, and that the Secretary of State had failed to establish objective and reasonable justification for the discriminatory effect of the statutory criteria (paragraph 24 of Maurice Kay LJ’s judgment). Henderson J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) held that DHPs could not be regarded as a complete or satisfactory answer to the problem (paragraphs 46 and 64). He also held in paragraph 64 that there was no question of a general exception from the normal bedroom test for disabled people of all kinds. The exception was sought for only a very limited category of claimants, namely those with a disability so severe that an extra bedroom is needed for a carer to sleep in, or in Gorry’s case where separate bedrooms were needed for children whose disabilities were so severe they could not be reasonably expected to share a single room. He made clear that such cases were by their very nature likely to be relatively few in number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse, and unlikely to undergo change or need regular monitoring.”"

This is particularly so in the case of a severely disabled person, because of the difficulty in finding suitable accommodation and the probable need for substantial physical alternations to be made to the property in order to adapt it to the person’s needs. Before undertaking such a commitment, therefore, a disabled person needs to have a reasonable degree of assurance that he will be able to pay the rent for the foreseeable future, and that he will not be left at the mercy of short term fluctuations in the amount of his housing-related benefits. For the reasons which I have given, [DHP’s] cannot in practice provide a disabled person with that kind of reassurance.”"

The national authorities are better able to judge this because of their “direct knowledge of their society and its needs” (see Stec, para 52). It does not follow that national courts should accord a similarly wide discretion to national governments (or even Parliaments).

This latter requirement had been expressed in Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden 5 EHRR 35, at para 69, as “whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights” (see James, para 50).

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed, taking account of both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In the context of allegations of discrimination, the question of what amounts to a ‘significant disadvantage’ for an applicant requires particularly careful scrutiny. Moreover, an alleged violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage without affecting an applicant’s pecuniary interest. It may also be that, even in the absence of a “significant disadvantage”, a question of principle raised by an application is of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention, such that, under the terms of the second element in Article 35 § 3 (b), “respect for human rights defined in the Convention ... requires an examination of the application on its merits” (see Daniel Faulkner v. the United Kingdom, no. 68909/13, § 26, 6 October 2016, with further references)."

With reference to the Court’s case-law it considered that it was well-established that victims of domestic violence have a right to physical and moral integrity under Article 8 of the Convention. The Centre referred to the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention emphasising that this imposes an obligation on states to provide protection to victims. Finally, it underlined that domestic violence frequently raises issues of gender based discrimination and that there is a uniform acceptance of the fact that women and girls are the predominant victims of serious and life threatening forms of violence."

Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 83, ECHR 2009 and Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § 112, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV).

Only differences in treatment based on the grounds enumerated in that Article are capable of resulting in discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 ( see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010 and Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, §§ 56-57, 13 July 2010). Thus, the prohibition enshrined in Article 14 encompasses differences of treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or “status”, (see Fábián v. Hungary [GC], no. 78117/13, § 113, 5 September 2017, with further references). In this regard, the Court has already held that a person’s health status, including disability and various health impairments, fall within the term “other status” in the text of Article 14 of the Convention (see Guberina, cited above, § 76 with further references). The Court has also considered that a discriminatory treatment of a person on account of the disability of his or her child, with whom he or she has close personal links and for whom he or she provides care, is a form of disability-based discrimination covered by Article 14 of the Convention (ibid., § 79). The Court has further held that victims of gender based violence may be able to invoke the protection of Article 14 in conjunction with the relevant substantive provisions of the Convention (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, ECHR 2009; Bălșan v. Romania, no. 49645/09, 23 May 2017)."

Thus, the Contracting States must refrain from subjecting persons or groups to different treatment where, under the above principles, such treatment would qualify as discriminatory. However, this is not the only facet of the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14. The right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is also violated when States, without an objective and reasonable justification, fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different (see Thlimmenos, cited above, § 44; Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, § 35, 10 May 2007; D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, § 175; Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 48420/10, 15 January 2013; and Kurić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], no. 26828/06, § 288, ECHR 2012).

The Court has also held that a policy or measure that has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group may be considered discriminatory, regardless of whether the policy or measure is specifically aimed at that group. Thus, indirect discrimination prohibited under Article 14 may arise under circumstances where a policy or measure produces a particularly prejudicial impact on certain persons as a result of a protected ground, such as gender or disability, attaching to their situation. In line with the general principles relating to the prohibition of discrimination, this is only the case, however, if such policy or measure has no “objective and reasonable” justification (see, among other authorities, S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 161, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, §§ 175 and 184-185)."

Moreover, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article (see Thlimmenos, cited above, § 44; Stec and Others, cited above, § 51; D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, § 175)."

In the context of Article 1 of Protocol 1 alone, the Court has often held that in matters concerning, for example, general measures of economic or social strategy, the States usually enjoy a wide margin of appreciation under the Convention (see Fábián, cited above, § 115; Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 109, ECHR 2014; Andrejeva, cited above, § 83). Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature’s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation”."

However, as the Court has stressed in the context of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 Protocol 1, although the margin of appreciation in the context of general measures of economic or social policy is, in principle, wide, such measures must nevertheless be implemented in a manner that does not violate the prohibition of discrimination as set out in the Convention and complies with the requirement of proportionality (see Fábián, cited above, § 115, with further references). Thus, even a wide margin in the sphere of economic or social policy does not justify the adoption of laws or practices that would violate the prohibition of discrimination. Hence, in that context the Court has limited its acceptance to respect the legislature’s policy choice as not “manifestly without reasonable foundation” to circumstances where an alleged difference in treatment resulted from a transitional measure forming part of a scheme carried out in order to correct an inequality (see Stec and Others, cited above, §§ 61-66; Runkee and White, cited above, §§ 40-41 and British Gurkha Welfare Society and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44818/11, § 81, 15 September 2016)."

Switzerland, no. 13444/04, § 84, ECHR 2009), and that because of the particular vulnerability of persons with disabilities such treatment would require very weighty reasons to be justified (see Guberina, cited above, § 73). The Court has also considered that as the advancement of gender equality is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before such a difference of treatment could be regarded as compatible with the Convention ( Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 127, ECHR 2012).",

This applied to all beneficiaries under the scheme without any distinction by reference to their characteristics such as disability or gender. In the present case, the applicants have been treated in the same way as other recipients of the Housing Benefit in that their entitlements have been reduced on the same grounds and according to the same criteria as those of other recipients.

As regards the effects of the measure, the Court observes that it was an anticipated consequence of the reduction of the Housing Benefit that all benefit recipients who experienced such a reduction could be at risk of losing their homes. Indeed, the Government argued that this precarity was the intention of the scheme; to incentivise families to move (see paragraph 74 above). The Court accepts the applicants’ arguments that in this respect, they were in a significantly different situation and particularly prejudiced by the policy because they demonstrated they had a particular need to be able to remain in their specifically adapted homes for reasons directly related to their status. In the case of the first applicant, loss of her home would cause exceptional hardship given her daughter’s severe mental and physical disabilities. In the case of the second applicant, loss of her home would risk her personal safety. Thus, for these reasons, the consequence of the measure was much more severe for the applicants than for others whose entitlement to Housing Benefit was reduced."

However, the Court notes that because of their vulnerable status the applicants were significantly less able than other Housing Benefit recipients to mitigate their loss by taking in tenants or by working (see paragraphs 8 and 71 above). Accordingly, they did not have the same possibilities available to them to mitigate their loss as other recipients of Housing Benefit."

The Court acknowledges that the DHP scheme had a number of significant disadvantages which were identified by the domestic courts, namely that the awards of DHP were purely discretionary in nature; their duration was uncertain; they were payable from a capped fund; and their amount could not be relied upon to replace the full amount of the shortfall (see paragraph 41 above). On the other hand, the scheme had some advantages in that it allowed local authorities to take individualised decisions, which the Court has identified as an important element to ensure proportionality (see a contrario Guberina ¸ cited above, § 93). Moreover, the awards of DHP are made subject to certain safeguards, in particular the requirement on local authorities to take their decisions in light of the Human Rights Act and their Public Sector Equality Duty which in the Court’s understanding would prevent them from refusing to award DHP where that could mean the applicant’s need for appropriately adapted accommodation was not met. The Court observes that the first applicant has in fact been awarded DHP for several years following the changes to the Housing Benefit Regulation. Whilst the DHP scheme could be characterised as not ensuring the same level of certainty and stability as the previous, unreduced Housing Benefit, its provision with attendant safeguards, amounts to a sufficiently weighty reason to satisfy the Court that the means employed to implement the measure had a reasonable relationship of proportionality to its legitimate aim.

In the absence of any information from that employer that the applicant had indeed been employed between 1963 and 1967, the Fund concluded that the data regarding her employment for the above - mentioned period had been erroneously entered in its records."

Holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. It would also be unfair to other individuals contributing to social security funds – in particular those denied a benefit because they failed to meet the statutory requirements. Lastly, it would amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest ( see, for example, Čakarević v.

France [GC], nos. 25088/94 and 2 others, § 100, ECHR 1999 ‑ III).

That assessment may involve the conduct of the parties, including the means employed by the State and their implementation. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Tunnel Report Limited v.

On 1 August 2011 the applicant, relying on Article 417 of the Civil Code ( Kodeks cywilny ), brought a civil action for compensation against the Zielona Góra Farmers ’ Social Security Fund. He considered that he should have been paid a disability pension for the whole period of his incapacity to perform farm work, starting from 1 April 2008. Thus, he demanded a payment of 13,850 Polish zlotys (PLN – approximately 3,462 euros (EUR)) covering the twenty-one months during which he had been deprived of his social benefits, together with and PLN 1,260 (approximately EUR 315) by way of reimbursement of the cost of the medical examination that he had undergone at his own expense and which had confirmed his incapacity for work."

On 29 February 2012 the Sulęcin District Court ( Sąd Rejonowy ) refused to grant the applicant the demanded compensation, finding that the requirements set out in Article 417 of the Civil Code had not been met – that is to say the activities of the Fund as a State representative had not been illegal ( bezprawne ). The District Court established that the medical experts had confirmed that they had not had at their disposal the complete relevant medical documentation and procedural files when they had issued the first medical report concerning the applicant. As a result, their second medical report had contained conclusions contrary to their previous evaluation of the applicant ’ s state of health. Nevertheless, it held that it could not override the final and legally binding judgment of 26 November 2011 issued by the Szczecin Court of Appeal, neither with respect to the appellate court ’ s legal assessment nor the underlying factual findings, owing to the scope of the principle of res iudicata, as provided in Article 365 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Kodeks postępowania cywilnego ), which precluded it from ruling anew on the issue of whether the applicant had been completely unfit for farm work after 31 March 2008. The court also referred in this regard to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 18 February 2003 (file no. II UK 139/02). Thus, the District Court found itself bound to disregard the experts ’ report issued during the second set of disability-pension proceedings instituted by the applicant to the extent to which it contradicted the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Moreover, it held that the courts in the previous sets of proceedings had not made any flagrant mistakes in their interpretation and application of the relevant legal principles that could have triggered the liability of the State Treasury."

Moreover, the court considered that the applicant had failed to prove that the lack of the complete medical documentation and procedural files had resulted from a failing on the part of the Fund. Additionally, the Regional Court examined the case under Article 417 2 of the Civil Code, which allowed the granting of compensation even in the event that the actions of the State representative in question had been legal, the condition for qualifying for such compensation being here a bodily injury ( szkoda na osobie ). The court, however, also refused to award compensation on those grounds, holding that the damage suffered by the applicant had been purely pecuniary in nature.

The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many authorities, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, § 48, Series A no. 108, and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

This provision places no restriction on the Contracting State ’ s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme.

In particular, the requisite “fair balance” will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, §§ 69-74, Series A no. 52, and Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], cited above, § 78). Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant ’ s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 38, Series A no. 332, and The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, § 89). Thus, the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a “disproportionate burden” (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v.

In that connection, the Court finds it significant that he was unemployed and evidently had difficulties pursuing gainful employment due to his disability ( see, mutatis mutandis, Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 123). That vulnerability was precisely what the disability benefit in question was meant to address. The Court further notes that the applicant had been dependent on the waiting period allowance he had been receiving on a regular basis for more than six years (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). Even if he had certain savings (see paragraphs 35 and 38 above), they appeared to have played no role in his eligibility for the disability benefit and moreover were clearly insufficient to provide for his long-term subsistence. The Court also observes that the decrease in the applicant ’ s disability benefit, which seriously affected his means of subsistence (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 74, 15 September 2009, and, by contrast, Valkov and Others v.

However, those disabled workers whose health had deteriorated after 1 January 2003 and were unable to find employment, like the applicant, had to bear the disproportionate burden of losing a significant portion of their disability benefit and, as observed in the report of the Institute for Economic Research submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 30 above), found themselves in a particularly precarious situation."

In the case under consideration, this implied that the beneficiary could no longer receive the waiting period allowance but was instead entitled to disability allowance. The Supreme Court further confirmed that beneficiaries of the rights based on a remaining capacity to work (namely category II and III) continued to enjoy their rights acquired under the 1992 Act only if, at the time of reassessment of their rights, the factual situation, which was the basis for the decision granting rights under the 1992 Act, remained unchanged.",

In particular, the Court has held that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 imposes no restriction on the Contracting States ’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. However, if a Contracting State has legislation in force providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 82 ).

In addition, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires that any interference be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised. The requisite fair balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden ( ibid ., § 115). In considering whether that is the case, the Court must have regard to the particular context of social security schemes, which are an expression of a society ’ s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 116, and Stefanetti and Others v. Italy, nos. 21838/10 and 7 others, § 55, 15 April 2014 )."

In a number of cases the Court has endeavoured to assess all the relevant elements against the specific background, attaching importance to such factors as the discriminatory nature of the loss of entitlement, the absence of transitional measures, the arbitrariness of the condition, as well as the applicant ’ s good faith (see Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 11 7, with references therein). An important consideration in this context is whether the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the social-insurance scheme in question has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his or her rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 118).",

That, as inferred from the provisions of the 1999 Act and confirmed in the Supreme Court ’ s case-law (see paragraph 28 above), meant that beneficiaries were in such cases no longer entitled to the rights provided for in the 1992 Act.

            [
                "46. The Court now turns to the issue at the centre of the present case − whether the interference imposed an excessive individual burden on the applicant. It observes that he had been receiving a monthly waiting period allowance of about EUR 390 until February 2011, on the basis of a decision by the regional ZPIZ ( see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The applicable legislation, both before the legislative reform in 1999 and afterwards, made the granting of a disability benefit dependent, inter alia, on the condition of having a limited capacity to work on medical grounds. The legislation also stipulated that beneficiaries were obliged to inform the authorities of any change in circumstances (see paragraphs 10 and 26 above). After the applicant sustained a shoulder injury and the regional ZPIZ, in 2011, reassessed his level of disability, finding that his capacity to work had further reduced, his waiting period allowance was replaced with a disability allowance of around EUR 19 0 per month, which is less than half of the amount he was receiving under the provisions of the 1992 Act (see paragraph 10 above). That was not because he no longer met the relevant eligibility criteria (compare and contrast Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, §§ 67-74, 8 December 2009, and Iwaszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 30614/06, § 56, 26 July 2011 ), but because of changes in the law (see, mutatis mutandis, Lakićević and Others v. Montenegro and Serbia, nos. 27458/06 and 3 others, § 70, 13 December 2011, and Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 - IX ) which were applicable to those who had either become disabled after 1 January 2003 or whose disability had worsened after that date (see section 397 of the 1999 Act, cited in paragraph 25 above, and the Supreme Court ’ s position, cited in paragraph 28 above )."

Though little information was submitted by the parties on that point, it would appear that the waiting period allowance and subsequent disability allowance were not directly related to any contributions paid by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above). Rather, they were essentially provided based on the principle of solidarity (see paragraph 41 above) and were therefore likely to be altered in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance (see, among many other authorities, Wieczorek, cited above, § 67, and, mutatis mutandis, Iwaszkiewicz, cited above, § 50 )."
            ],
            [
                "48. That said, the Court cannot ignore that the legislature stipulated in the 1999 Act that those who had acquired rights under the 1992 Act would continue to enjoy them after the new legislation came into force (see section 397 ( 1 ) of the 1999 Act, cited in paragraph 25 above). That reinforced the applicant ’ s legitimate expectation of continuing to receive a waiting period allowance after the legislative reform and, provided that he remained unemployed, until his retirement (see paragraphs 8 and 24 above). It was only when his disability was found to have deteriorated − a fact which he could have hardly predicted and prepared for − that he became affected by the new legislation. In the Court ’ s view, this differential treatment of two groups of unemployed disabled workers – those whose disabilities remained unchanged and those whose disabilities had deteriorated after 1 January 2003 – which resulted in the applicant being suddenly divested of half of his disability benefit while being at the same time further limited in working opportunities, carries great weight in the assessment of the proportionality issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatits mutandis, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 43)."

                "49. Other important considerations for the Court ’ s assessment relate to the nature of the benefit and the effect the impugned measure had on the applicant ’ s particular situation. In that connection, the Court finds it significant that he was unemployed and evidently had difficulties pursuing gainful employment due to his disability ( see, mutatis mutandis, Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 123). That vulnerability was precisely what the disability benefit in question was meant to address. The Court further notes that the applicant had been dependent on the waiting period allowance he had been receiving on a regular basis for more than six years (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). Even if he had certain savings (see paragraphs 35 and 38 above), they appeared to have played no role in his eligibility for the disability benefit and moreover were clearly insufficient to provide for his long-term subsistence. The Court also observes that the decrease in the applicant ’ s disability benefit, which seriously affected his means of subsistence (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 74, 15 September 2009, and, by contrast, Valkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 2033/04 and 8 others, § 97, 2 5 October 2011), was not mitigated by any transitional measure allowing him to adapt to the new situation ( see, mutatis mutandis, Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 124 )."

It is indeed mindful of the fact that the reform in legislation concerning pension and disability insurance served a legitimate purpose, as found above (see paragraph 45 above), and also de facto resulted in the increased employment of disabled workers (see paragraph 29 above). However, those disabled workers whose health had deteriorated after 1 January 2003 and were unable to find employment, like the applicant, had to bear the disproportionate burden of losing a significant portion of their disability benefit and, as observed in the report of the Institute for Economic Research submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 30 above), found themselves in a particularly precarious situation."

In the present case, the Court observes that, whilst the applicant ’ s entitlement to the benefit in question was never called into doubt, the domestic courts, in essence, justified the denial of the benefit with reference to a lack of budgetary funds earmarked for the purpose of the St Petersburg authorities providing the eligible residents of that city with free medicines (see paragraphs 25 - 30 above). At the same time, they did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the delivery of the benefit in question conditional on any limits on the budgetary funds, that provided for any discretion on the part of the executive authorities to reduce or refuse that benefit once the limit of the allocated budgetary funds had been reached, or any similar provision, which could have formed a legal basis for such a finding. It is noteworthy in this connection that, in subsequent court decisions taken in the context of proceedings examining similar claims, it was clearly stated that that the existing legal framework established the right of those entitled to be provided with the necessary medicines not only free of charge but also without any restrictions, and that setting a maximum quantity of a particular medicine per person, or having insufficient budgetary funds allocated to a particular region could not be the basis for a refusal to provide the individuals concerned with medicines that were essential for their lives (see paragraph 43 above)."

The Court finds it important to stress that a State has a wide margin of appreciation in implementing social and economic policies, including, in particular, enacting laws in the context of a change of political or economic regime, adopting policies to protect the public purse or reallocate funds, and introducing austerity measures prompted by a major economic crisis (see Béláné Nagy, cited above, §§ 113-14, and the authorities cited therein ). It reaffirms that the fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility for payment or as to the quantum of the benefit. The Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. In present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights, and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see, recently, Baczúr v. Hungary, no. 8263/15, § 28, 7 March 2017)."

As it has been noted above, the applicant ’ s eligibility for the benefit in question was never called into doubt by any of the authorities, nor was it ever alleged that he did not satisfy any of the stipulated conditions, that his relevant status had changed, or that any legal conditions had changed so that he failed to satisfy any of those conditions. It is also of relevance that the welfare benefit in question concerned the applicant ’ s entitlement to receive the medicine necessary for the treatment of his cancer, which presupposed that uninterrupted enjoyment of that benefit was critical for the applicant ’ s life. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, a refusal to provide such a benefit to an applicant who satisfied all of the conditions was impossible to foresee and is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law."

When speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, and requires the measure complained of to be based on adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (ibid., § 74, and see also, among many other authorities, Lekić v.

At the same time, they did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the delivery of the benefit in question conditional on any limits on the budgetary funds, that provided for any discretion on the part of the executive authorities to reduce or refuse that benefit once the limit of the allocated budgetary funds had been reached, or any similar provision, which could have formed a legal basis for such a finding. It is noteworthy in this connection that, in subsequent court decisions taken in the context of proceedings examining similar claims, it was clearly stated that that the existing legal framework established the right of those entitled to be provided with the necessary medicines not only free of charge but also without any restrictions, and that setting a maximum quantity of a particular medicine per person, or having insufficient budgetary funds allocated to a particular region could not be the basis for a refusal to provide the individuals concerned with medicines that were essential for their lives (see paragraph 43 above)."

It reaffirms that the fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility for payment or as to the quantum of the benefit. The Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. In present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights, and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see, recently, Baczúr v.

It is also of relevance that the welfare benefit in question concerned the applicant ’ s entitlement to receive the medicine necessary for the treatment of his cancer, which presupposed that uninterrupted enjoyment of that benefit was critical for the applicant ’ s life.

The applicant argued that he had been ineligible, under the domestic law, for legal aid in civil proceedings, with the result that it had been meaningless to request a court to appoint him a legal aid lawyer. Nevertheless, he had submitted such a request to the first-instance court at a preliminary hearing and it had been rejected by the judge. The applicant insisted that that request had not been reflected in the transcript of the hearing. With reference to the criteria regarding legal aid in civil proceedings established in the case of Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom (no. 68416/01, § 61, ECHR 2005 ‑ II), the applicant stressed that what had been at stake in his civil dispute had been particularly important to him, given that it had concerned the provision of medicine essential for his life. He further argued that the case at hand had been legally and factually complex, given the fact that its subject matter had been governed by laws and numerous executive decisions and orders and had involved many parties. The applicant also contended that, being an old-age and disability pensioner without any legal qualifications, he had been unable to represent himself effectively in the relevant proceedings. He insisted that his experience working in a law firm, as referred to by the Government (see paragraph 84 below), had been irrelevant, as that firm had only provided consulting services and had never represented clients before a court. The applicant also stressed that during the relevant period he had been following a cancer treatment regime, and that his health condition had made it physically difficult for him to represent himself before the courts. With reference to the fact that his adversaries in the proceedings had been the State authorities, represented by professional lawyers, whilst he had had to present his case on his own without any legal assistance or advice, the applicant argued that he had been placed at a substantial disadvantage vis ‑ à ‑ vis the opposing party, which had compromised the overall fairness of the proceedings."

                "84. The Government pointed out that under the relevant legislation as in force in the relevant period, the applicant had not been eligible for legal aid in civil proceedings. They further argued that, according to the transcript of the hearings before the first-instance court, he had never requested that the court appoint him a lawyer, nor relied on any circumstances which would have demonstrated the necessity of the provision of legal aid to him. The Government also contended that, in any event, the applicant had been fully able to state his case and to present his arguments before the domestic courts. They pointed out, in particular, that the documents submitted by the applicant to the first-instance court revealed that in 2007 the applicant had been employed as a deputy director of a consulting law firm, which, in the Government ’ s view, demonstrated that he had legal knowledge and experience. His court claim, as well as his written submissions and applications, had been coherent, motivated and had contained references to the relevant domestic law. Furthermore, the applicant ’ s civil case had not been particularly complex, the case file had comprised only 226 pages, and the proceedings before the first-instance court had lasted for less than two months (from 10 December 2007 to 5 February 2008), during which period there had been four hearings. Therefore the present case was distinguishable from the case of Steel and Morris ( cited above ). On the whole, the Government insisted that the principle of equality of arms, as well as the overall fairness of the proceedings, had been respected, that the applicant ’ s written applications had been examined by the court and granted in so far as the courts had considered them relevant, and that the essence of the applicant ’ s arguments before the courts had been duly addressed."

The question whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant ’ s capacity to represent him or herself effectively (see Steel and Morris, cited above, § 61)."

The Court does not consider it necessary to address that point, as it is clear that under the domestic law as in force at the relevant time, the applicant had not been eligible for legal aid in civil proceedings ( see paragraph 47 above). It further considers that, although what was at stake for the applicant was of significant importance to him, his case does not appear to have been particularly complex either factually or legally. Indeed, neither the facts nor the law were contested by the parties. The materials in the Court ’ s possession reveal that the applicant ’ s written submissions were well ‑ developed and reasoned; that he was able to file written applications and requests, which were examined by the courts and granted, in so far as the courts considered it appropriate to do so; and that he actively participated in oral pleadings, and advanced his arguments (see paragraph 18 above). Overall, it is clear that the applicant was fully able to state his case and to represent himself effectively, and his arguments were not only addressed but also received reasoned replies. There is nothing in the case file to demonstrate that the applicant was unable to represent himself effectively or that he was deprived of a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

In the present case, the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the authorities ’ failure to provide the applicant with the medicine necessary for the treatment of his disease, even though his entitlement to that welfare benefit was sufficiently established in the domestic law. It observes that, as established by the domestic courts and acknowledged by the Government, the applicant spent EUR 1,400 on the purchase of that medicine (see paragraphs 9, 23 and 90 above). It must therefore be accepted that there is a causal link between this amount and the violation found. In such circumstances, the Court considers it appropriate to award this element of the claim for compensation for pecuniary damage. On the other hand, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the secondary element claimed in respect of pecuniary damage, namely the sum of EUR 170. Accordingly, it rejects the applicant ’ s claim in that respect.

The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities ’ part to comply with the judgment of that court. The administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice.

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of the property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem. Thirdly, confiscation measures may be applied not only to the direct proceeds of crime but also to property, including any incomes and other indirect benefits, obtained by converting or transforming the direct proceeds of crime or intermingling them with other, possibly lawful, assets.

The provision reflects the same theory that lies behind a value-based model of confiscation: what matters is not to allow the offender to enrich him or herself by illegal means.",

Primary proceeds are those assets directly obtained through the commission of the offence – e.g., a bribe of $100,000. The secondary proceeds, by contrast, refer to benefits derived from the original proceeds, like bank interest or the amount increased as a consequence of investment. In this regard, the Convention requires States Parties to provide mandatory confiscation for both the primary and secondary proceeds.",

                "82. At the outset the Government asked the Court to take note of the scale of the corruption phenomenon that had been ravaging the country prior to the launching of a vast array of anti-corruption measures by the authorities in February 2004. The corrupt environment had been particularly apparent in the Ajarian Autonomous Republic, in whose government the first applicant had occupied high-ranking posts at the material time. On the other hand, only a few years after the State had undertaken a number of crucial legislative initiatives to bolster efforts to combat corruption, of which administrative confiscation constituted a major part, a firm trend of significant reduction in corruption could be readily observed, from 2006 onwards. In 20 09 the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index had increased Georgia ’ s score from 1.8 in 2003 to 4.1, thus ranking it 66th out of 174 countries ( see paragraphs 6 9 - 73 above )."

            [
                "83. The Government emphasised that all those positive results in the fight against corruption could never have been achieved without the mechanism of administrative confiscation which had been applied in the applicants ’ case. They briefly described the nature of that legal mechanism. In particular, administrative confiscation did not constitute a part of criminal proceedings and was not of a punitive nature but, on the contrary, was of a civil-law, compensatory nature, being aimed at remedying the pecuniary damage caused either to private individuals or to the State ( see paragraphs 49-54 above). The Government stated that such a procedure – confiscation of the property in question in the absence of a final criminal conviction, with the burden of proof being shifted onto the respondent – was in full conformity with the relevant international standards. In fact, it was the Council of Europe bodies and the OECD who had been the first to insist that Georgia should introduce such a measure ( see paragraphs 6 6-70 above)."
            ],
            [
                "84. Observing that the proceedings for confiscation of the applicants ’ property had strictly followed the judicial procedure laid down for that purpose by Article 37 § 1 of the CCP and Articles 21 §§ 4 to 11 of the CAP, the Government submitted that the resulting confiscation had been lawful. Those legal provisions were readily accessible to the public and their legal consequences were clear and foreseeable to the public at large, including the applicants. Furthermore, it could not be said that the legislative amendments in question had suddenly introduced revolutionary methods in the fight against corruption in February 2004, as seven years prior to those amendments there had already existed a law providing for the principles of prevention, exposure and eradication of corruption and the need to hold corrupt officials criminally, administratively and disciplinarily liable for their illicit deeds, namely the 1997 Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service (see paragraphs 44-48 above). The Government then argued, by reference to the Court ’ s judgments in the cases of AGOSI ( cited above, § 51 ) and Raimondo (cited above, § 29), that confiscation should be considered as a measure to control the use of property."

            [
                "85. The Government firmly maintained that the introduction of the procedure of administrative confiscation served the public interest of the eradication of corruption in the public service. As to the implication of “relatives” and “connected persons”, that particular aspect was intended as a response to the well-known and widespread practice whereby corrupt public officials would hide the proceeds of their illicit deeds by fictitiously registering those proceeds in the names of their friends or relatives. In doing so, corrupt officials attempted to avoid financial accountability before the public, meaning that the legal obligation to submit financial declarations in their own names, as initially provided for by the 1997 Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service, was deprived of any real value. The confiscation of the applicants ’ property had therefore been justified by socio-legal and economic considerations, namely the need to eradicate corruption and to return the illicitly acquired property to the lawful owners or, in the absence of such, to the State budget."

            [
                "86. As to the proportionality of the confiscation, the Government argued that that requirement was satisfied by the fact that the civil dispute between the State and the applicants had been the subject of a comprehensive judicial review by an independent and objective court. However, the applicants had failed to prove, in the relevant judicial proceedings, that they had had legal incomes that were sufficient to enable them to acquire the property, which had a much higher value. In this connection the Government also stated that, given that the impugned confiscation represented a measure to control the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the respondent State enjoyed a particularly wide margin of appreciation in the context of the policy of fighting such a major crime as corruption.",

                "88. With regard to the subject matter of the present case, the applicants confined their arguments to complaining about the major constituent elements of the administrative confiscation procedure as such. In particular, they stated that the confiscation of their property had been arbitrary, the authorities having claimed that it had been obtained as a result of the first applicant ’ s corrupt activities, without first having a final conviction against him proving his involvement in the commission of the impugned activities. In that regard they stated that the first applicant had been convicted of the offences with which he had been charged on 25 August 2004 (see paragraph 9 above); the launching of that criminal case had acted as a spur to the initiation of the administrative confiscation proceedings, as late as January 2010, that is, five years after the confiscation order had become final (see paragraph 36 above; no copy of the first applicant ’ s conviction was submitted). The applicants also complained that the burden of proof in the confiscation proceedings had been shifted onto them, arguing that, according to the general principles of criminal procedure, it was always the public prosecutor who should carry the burden of proving a defendant ’ s guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
            ],
            [
                "89. The applicants also argued that the confiscation of their property had not been a provisional measure but, on the contrary, an irreversible act, which thus could not be characterised as control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, but should be treated as de facto expropriation of their property. Maintaining that the confiscation measure in their case amounted to a criminal sanction, the applicants also complained that the amendments of 13 February 2004 to the Code of Administrative Procedure had been applied retroactively in their case, since the property confiscated had in reality been acquired between November 1997 and May 2004. In that connection they added that the amendments in question had not been sufficiently clear and understandable to them as persons without any meaningful legal education."

                "90. The applicants ’ further submissions were aimed at calling into question the factual findings of the domestic courts. In particular they asserted, without submitting any evidence in that regard, that the majority of the confiscated property had in reality been financed from the personal savings of the first applicant ’ s wife, a Russian national, and her distant relatives living and doing business in Russia. They complained that those facts had not been taken into account by the Supreme Court of Georgia during the relevant cassation proceedings. As to the reasons for the first, third and fourth applicants ’ failure to attend the court hearings, the applicants explained that the first applicant had by that time already fled from Georgia to Russia for fear of criminal prosecution, whilst the remaining two applicants had simply had no trust in the country ’ s judicial system."

The subject matter of the applicants ’ complaints is the compatibility of the so-called administrative confiscation procedure, under which some of their property was forfeited in favour of either third persons or the State, with the right to protection of property. Having regard to the relevant domestic legislative framework (see paragraphs 49-54 above) and comparing it with the relevant legal concepts employed by the international community (see paragraphs 55-64 above), the Court notes that the disputed procedure, despite the terminology used to describe it in domestic law, is far from being a purely administrative confiscation but, on the contrary, is linked to the prior existence of a criminal charge against a public official and thus represents by its nature a civil action in rem aimed at the recovery of assets wrongfully or inexplicably accumulated by the public officials concerned and their close entourage.",

The first one, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property in general. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, Immobiliare Saffi v.

As to which exactly of the three above-mentioned property rules should apply to the applicants ’ situation, the Court reiterates that where a confiscation measure has been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” ( within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, amongst many other authorities, Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, § 34, Series A no. 316 ‑ A; Riela and Others v.

An essential condition for interference to be deemed compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that it should be lawful : the second paragraph recognises that States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Furthermore, any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate public (or general) interest. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 27265/95, § 85, 17 October 2002, and Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, § 59, 8 December 2009)."

                "97. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 also requires that any interference be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised. In other words, a “fair balance” must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. The requisite balance will not be found if the person or persons concerned have had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, amongst many other authorities, The Former King of Greece and Others v.

Furthermore, a wide margin of appreciation is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of political, economic or social strategy, and the Court generally respects the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Azienda Agricola Silverfunghi S.a.s. and Others v.

Having regard to the wording of those provisions, the Court considers that there cannot be any doubt about their clarity, precision or foreseeability (see, for instance, Khoniakina v. Georgia, no. 17767/08, § 75, 19 June 2012, and Grifhorst v. France, no. 28336/02, § 91, 26 February 2009 )."

As to the applicants ’ argument that it was arbitrary to extend retrospectively the scope of the confiscation mechanism to the property that they had acquired prior to the entry into force of the amendment of 13 February 2004, the Court observes at the outset that the amendment in question was not the first piece of legislation in the country which required public officials to be held accountable for the unexplained origins of their wealth. Thus, as far back as 1997 the Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service had already addressed such issues as corruption offences and the obligation of public officials to declare and justify the origins of their property and that of their close entourage, subject to possible criminal, administrative or disciplinary liability the exact nature of which was to be regulated by separate laws governing breaches of those anti ‑ corruption requirements (see paragraphs 44-48 above). That being so, it is clear that the amendment of 13 February 2004 merely regulated afresh the pecuniary aspects of the existing anti-corruption legal standards. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the “lawfulness” requirement contained in Article of Protocol No. 1 cannot normally be construed as preventing the legislature from controlling the use of property or otherwise interfering with pecuniary rights via new retrospective provisions regulating continuing factual situations or legal relations anew (see Azienda Agricola Silverfunghi S.a.s. and Others, cited above, § 104, 24 June 2014; Arras and Others v.

As regards the legitimacy of the aim pursued by the impugned confiscation, the Court observes that the measure formed an essential part of a larger legislative package aimed at intensifying the fight against corruption in the public service (see paragraphs 49, 82 and 8 3 above ). Having regard to the domestic legal framework (see paragraphs 52-54 and 8 5 above), it is evident that the rationale behind the forfeiture of wrongfully acquired property and unexplained wealth owned by persons accused of serious offences committed while in public office and from their family members and close relatives was twofold, having both a compensatory and a preventive aim."

The compensatory aspect consisted in the obligation to restore the injured party in civil proceedings to the status which had existed prior to the unjust enrichment of the public official in question, by returning wrongfully acquired property either to its previous lawful owner or, in the absence of such, to the State. This was, for instance, a consequence of the proceedings in rem in the present case, where one of the houses in the first applicant ’ s wrongful possession turned out to have been obtained from a third party as the result of duress; that third party, a private individual, then acquired entitlement to benefit from the confiscation of that particular property (see paragraphs 34 and 3 6 above, as well as the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Tchitchinadze, cited above, §§ 9, 13 and 16). The aim of the civil proceedings in rem was to prevent unjust enrichment through corruption as such, by sending a clear signal to public officials already involved in corruption or considering so doing that their wrongful acts, even if they passed unscaled by the criminal justice system, would nevertheless not procure pecuniary advantage either for them or for their families (see, mutatis mutandis, Raimondo, cited above, § 30; Veits, cited above, § 71; and Silickienė v.

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of the property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem. Thirdly, confiscation measures may be applied not only to the direct proceeds of crime but also to property, including any incomes and other indirect benefits, obtained by converting or transforming the direct proceeds of crime or intermingling them with other, possibly lawful, assets. Finally, confiscation measures may be applied not only to persons directly suspected of criminal offences but also to any third parties which hold ownership rights without the requisite bona fide with a view to disguising their wrongful role in amassing the wealth in question."

The Court observes that the domestic authorities put the received instructions into practice by adopting the amendment of 13 February 2004. As far back as April and June 2006, and then again in September 2013, the above-mentioned international legal expert bodies commended the authorities for having largely complied with their instructions. They noted that, thanks to the introduction of civil proceedings in rem in addition to the possibility of confiscation through criminal proceedings, the Georgian legislation had been brought into line with the appropriate requirements of the international legislation, and in particular with the relevant Council of Europe Conventions, although they still warned the Georgian authorities against possible misuse of that procedure, calling for the utmost transparency in that regard (see paragraphs 6 6 - 73 above ).

The Court also recalls previous cases in which it was required to examine, from the standpoint of the proportionality test of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, broadly similar procedures for the forfeiture of property linked to the alleged commission of various serious offences entailing unjust enrichment. As regards property presumed to have been acquired either in full or in part with the proceeds of drug-trafficking offences or other illicit activities of mafia-type or criminal organisations, the Court did not see any problem in finding the confiscation measures to be proportionate even in the absence of a conviction establishing the guilt of the accused persons. The Court also found it legitimate for the relevant domestic authorities to issue confiscation orders on the basis of a preponderance of evidence which suggested that the respondents ’ lawful incomes could not have sufficed for them to acquire the property in question. Indeed, whenever a confiscation order was the result of civil proceedings in rem which related to the proceeds of crime derived from serious offences, the Court did not require proof “beyond reasonable doubt” of the illicit origins of the property in such proceedings. Instead, proof on a balance of probabilities or a high probability of illicit origins, combined with the inability of the owner to prove the contrary, was found to suffice for the purposes of the proportionality test under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The domestic authorities were further given leeway under the Convention to apply confiscation measures not only to persons directly accused of offences but also to their family members and other close relatives who were presumed to possess and manage the ill-gotten property informally on behalf of the suspected offenders, or who otherwise lacked the necessary bona fide status (see Raimondo, cited above, § 30; Arcuri and Others v.

In this connection the Court also attaches importance to the similar conclusions of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, which found the civil proceedings in rem to be devoid of any arbitrariness (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 43 above) Indeed, it was only reasonable to expect all three applicants – one of whom had been directly accused of corruption in a separate set of criminal proceedings, whilst the remaining two were presumed, as the accused ’ s family members, to have benefited unduly from the proceeds of his crime – to discharge their part of the burden of proof by refuting the prosecutor ’ s substantiated suspicions about the wrongful origins of their assets. Moreover, those civil proceedings for confiscation clearly formed part of a policy aimed at the prevention and eradication of corruption in the public service, and the Court reiterates that in implementing such policies, respondent States must be given a wide margin of appreciation with regard to what constitutes the appropriate means of applying measures to control the use of property such as the confiscation of all types of proceeds of crime (see, for instance, Yildirim v.

Those summonses were served at the applicants ’ postal addresses twice, with the domestic court even postponing a hearing on one occasion, but the first and fourth applicants still failed to avail themselves of their procedural rights (see paragraphs 18, 19, 24 and 25 above). The first applicant ’ s reference to the fact that he was seeking to evade the criminal investigation at that time (see paragraph 90 above) is irrelevant in this regard, since he and the fourth applicant could have designated lawyers to represent their interests at first instance, as they did subsequently before the cassation court ( compare with Bongiorno and Others v.

As to the applicants ’ argument that the domestic courts ordered the confiscation of their property on the ground of a mere, unsubstantiated suspicion put forward by the public prosecutor, the Court finds it ill ‑ founded. The domestic courts duly examined the public prosecutor ’ s claim in the adversarial proceedings in the light of the numerous supporting documents available in the case file ( see paragraph 12 above ). That evidence led the domestic courts to the finding that the considerable assets acquired by the Gogitidze family during the tenure of the first applicant in public office could not have been financed by his official salaries alone, whilst the remaining applicants had had no other significant sources of income either. A careful examination of the applicants ’ financial situation confirmed the existence of a considerable discrepancy between their income and their wealth, and that discrepancy, which was a well-documented factual finding, then became the basis for confiscation."

A mobile phone at the heart of the arrangements for the haulage of the drugs was registered in the name of [X]. Just as the jury did not believe Mr Phillips, neither do I. What has happened here, in my judgment, is a device of just the sort providing a cover to explain the transfer of money which one would expect to find in concealing benefit from drug trafficking. There is an apparently ordinary, formal, commercial transfer of property, appropriately done through solicitors in the ordinary way, which has never ultimately been formally finalised, and my judgment is that it was indeed a sham, that the property ... is still owned by the accused ...”"

He told the jury that he always dealt in cash in all his transactions, not only dealing with these but other transactions, he presenting himself to the jury as a general wheeler-dealer, having specialised at one stage in cars, more recently in mobile telephones, but willing to deal in anything which would offer a profit. He says he never kept records at all. He accepts and asserts that he dealt dishonestly in cars, as well as legitimately, and that is certainly so. He has been convicted during the relevant period of offences of dishonesty in relation to ringing cars and was sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment in respect of that. There are also in the papers before me indications of earning legitimate commissions in ordinary sales of cars.",

In the absence of a current valuation, but taking judicial notice of a recent modest recovery in the housing market after a long, flat period, I am satisfied that the GBP 50,000 which he said in evidence was what such a property was worth in 1992, that is to say during the long, flat period, I am satisfied that GBP 50,000 is a fair estimate of the likely net proceeds of a sale of that property now or in the relatively near future.",

He and his father said that the business was worth GBP 150,000 in 1993. That is what was purported to be the basis of the GBP 50,000 he was to be given for it. There is no evidence that it is worth any less now, and I therefore find his realisable share in the equity in that business to be worth GBP 50,000. Since I am satisfied as to GBP 100,000 realisable sums, that figure exceeds the GBP 91,400 and under section 5 I find the amount to be recovered to be that figure.”",

                "“... By asking the court to make a confiscation order, the prosecutor is asking it to assess the value of the proceeds of the petitioner’s drug trafficking. It is therefore asking the court to reach the stage of saying that he has trafficked in drugs. If that is criminal, that seems to me to be closely analogous to an actual charge of an actual crime, in Scottish terms. There is of course no indictment or complaint, and no conviction. And the advocate depute pointed out a further difference, that a Scottish complaint or indictment would have to be specific, and would require evidence, whereas this particular allegation was unspecific and based on no evidence. But the suggestion that there is less need for a presumption of innocence in the latter situation appears to me to be somewhat Kafkaesque, and to portray vice as a virtue. With no notice of what he is supposed to have done, or of any basis which there might be for treating him as having done it, the accused’s need for the presumption of innocence is in my opinion all the greater ... I can see no basis upon which it could be said that [such] assumptions ... would not offend against the presumption of innocence, leaving it to the accused to show that these assumptions were incorrect. ...”",

The questions for the Court regarding the applicability of this Article to the confiscation proceedings are, firstly, whether the prosecutor’s application for a confiscation order following the applicant’s conviction amounted to the bringing of a new “charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 2, and secondly, even if that question must be answered in the negative, whether Article 6 § 2 should nonetheless have some application to protect the applicant from assumptions made during the confiscation proceedings."

Switzerland, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V, p. 1488, § 39, and, mutatis mutandis, Welch, cited above, p. 13, §§ 27-28)."

As the Lord Chief Justice observed in Benjafield and Others (see paragraph 25 above), “[i]n English domestic law, confiscation orders are part of the sentencing process which follow upon the conviction of the defendant of the criminal offences with which he is charged”."

Turning to the second and third relevant criteria – the nature of the proceedings and the type and severity of the penalty at stake – it is true that the assumption provided for in the 1994 Act, that all property held by the applicant within the preceding six years represented the proceeds of drug trafficking, required the national court to assume that he had been involved in other unlawful drug-related activities prior to the offence of which he was convicted. In contrast to the usual obligation on the prosecution to prove the elements of the allegations against the accused, the burden was on the applicant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he acquired the property in question other than through drug trafficking. Following the judge’s inquiry, a substantial confiscation order – in the amount of GBP 91,400 – was imposed. If the applicant failed to pay this amount he was to serve an extra two years’ imprisonment, consecutive to the nine-year term he had already received in respect of the November 1995 offence."

Although the Crown Court assumed that he had benefited from drug trafficking in the past, this was not, for example, reflected in his criminal record, to which was added only his conviction for the November 1995 offence. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the applicant was “charged with a criminal offence”. Instead, the purpose of the procedure under the 1994 Act was to enable the national court to assess the amount at which the confiscation order should properly be fixed. The Court considers that this procedure was analogous to the determination by a court of the amount of a fine or the length of a period of imprisonment to be imposed on a properly convicted offender. This, indeed, was the conclusion which it reached in Welch (judgment cited above) when, having examined the reality of the situation, it decided that a confiscation order constituted a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7."

Once an accused has properly been proved guilty of that offence, Article 6 § 2 can have no application in relation to allegations made about the accused’s character and conduct as part of the sentencing process, unless such accusations are of such a nature and degree as to amount to the bringing of a new “charge” within the autonomous Convention meaning referred to in paragraph 32 above (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 37-38, § 90)."

This right is not, however, absolute, since presumptions of fact or of law operate in every criminal-law system and are not prohibited in principle by the Convention, as long as States remain within certain limits, taking into account the importance of what is at stake and maintaining the rights of the defence (see Salabiaku v.

Instead, the Court must determine whether the way in which this assumption was applied in the applicant’s case offended the basic principles of a fair procedure inherent in Article 6 § 1 (see Salabiaku, cited above, pp. 17-18, § 30, and Saunders, cited above, pp. 2064-65, § 69)."

Thus, although the confiscation order calculated by way of the statutory assumption was considerable –GBP 91,400 – and although the applicant risked a further term of two years’ imprisonment if he failed to make the payment, his conviction of an additional drug-trafficking offence was not at stake."

Further, whilst the assumption was mandatory when the sentencing court was assessing whether and to what extent the applicant had benefited from the proceeds of drug trafficking, the system was not without safeguards. Thus, the assessment was carried out by a court with a judicial procedure including a public hearing, advance disclosure of the prosecution case and the opportunity for the applicant to adduce documentary and oral evidence. The court was empowered to make a confiscation order of a smaller amount if satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that only a lesser sum could be realised. The principal safeguard, however, was that the assumption made by the 1994 Act could have been rebutted if the applicant had shown, again on the balance of probabilities, that he had acquired the property other than through drug trafficking. Furthermore, the judge had a discretion not to apply the assumption if he considered that applying it would give rise to a serious risk of injustice."

In calculating the amount of the confiscation order based on the benefits of drug trafficking, therefore, the judge expressed himself to be reliant on the statutory assumption (see paragraph 13 above). In reality, however, and looking in detail at the steps taken by the judge to reach the final figure of GBP 91,400, the Court notes that in respect of every item taken into account the judge was satisfied, on the basis either of the applicant’s admissions or of evidence adduced by the prosecution, that the applicant owned the property or had spent the money, and that the obvious inference was that it had come from an illegitimate source. Thus, the judge found “real indications on the civil basis of proof” that the sale of the house to X had not been genuine and was instead a cover for the transfer of drug money (see paragraph 14 above). As for the additional GBP 28,000 which the applicant admitted receiving in cash from X, the judge said: “No sensible explanation for the involvement of [X] … was given to me at all, and it is impossible, in my judgment, to see any sensible reason other than that ... it was a simple payment.” Similarly, when assessing the amount of the applicant’s expenditure on cars, the judge based himself on the lowest of the applicant’s estimates as to how much he had spent (see paragraph 16 above). Since the applicant was not able to provide any record explaining the source of this money, the judge assumed that it was a benefit of drug trafficking. On the basis of the judge’s findings, there could have been no objection to including the matters in a schedule of the applicant’s assets for the purpose of sentencing, even if the statutory assumption had not applied."

Furthermore, the Court notes that, had the applicant’s account of his financial dealings been true, it would not have been difficult for him to rebut the statutory assumption; as the judge stated, the evidentiary steps which he could have taken to demonstrate the legitimate sources of his money and property were “perfectly obvious and ordinary and simple” (see paragraph 13 above). It is not open to the applicant to complain of unfairness by virtue of the fact that the judge may have included in his calculations assets purchased with the proceeds of other, undocumented forms of illegal activity, such as “car ringing”."

The judge accepted the applicant’s evidence when assessing the value of these assets.

This could be seen from the order in the present case, which had been made for the purpose of depriving the defendant of illegal gains.

The preventive purpose of confiscating property that might be available for use in future drug-trafficking operations as well as the purpose of ensuring that crime does not pay are evident from the ministerial statements that were made to Parliament at the time of the introduction of the legislation (see paragraph 11 above). However it cannot be excluded that legislation which confers such broad powers of confiscation on the courts also pursues the aim of punishing the offender.

Like the Commission, the Court finds that the seizure was provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act (see paragraph 18 above) and did not purport to deprive the applicant of his possessions but only to prevent him from using them. It is therefore the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) which is relevant here.",
                "In addition, the applicant did not contend that on 13 May 1985 it was unreasonable for the District Court to hold that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to show that the possessions seized represented the proceeds from unlawful activities or their reinvestment. What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

                "The Court is fully aware of the difficulties encountered by the Italian State in the fight against the Mafia. As a result of its unlawful activities, in particular drug-trafficking, and its international connections, this \"organisation\" has an enormous turnover that is subsequently invested, inter alia, in the real property sector. Confiscation, which is designed to block these movements of suspect capital, is an effective and necessary weapon in the combat against this cancer. It therefore appears proportionate to the aim pursued, all the more so because it in fact entails no additional restriction in relation to seizure.",

                "\" ... The existence of preventive measures is not in itself contrary to the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations, not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts, but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 27 of 1959 and judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Because of their particular object, preventive measures do not relate to the commission of a specific unlawful act but to a pattern of behaviour defined by law as conduct indicating the existence of danger to society (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Consequently, in the Italian legal system, there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures. The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act.",
                "In other words, a criminal penalty relates to an offence already committed, whereas a preventive measure is intended to reduce the risk of future offences (see, mutatis mutandis, Constitutional Court, judgment no. 53 of 1968, concerning security measures).",
                "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different, not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter. For example, the presumption of innocence enunciated in Article 27 of the Constitution does not concern preventive measures, which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Similarly, such measures do not fall within the scope of Article 25 para. 2 of the Constitution, which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions. The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in the Court of Cassation with regard to confiscation orders under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. The Court of Cassation has ruled, firstly, that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Piraino judgment of 30 January 1985). Secondly, the Court of Cassation has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive, as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered (Court of Cassation, Oliveri judgment of 12 May 1986) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force (Court of Cassation, Pipitone judgment of 4 January 1985).",
                "In spite of these limitations, preventive measures remain open to thorough scrutiny of their compatibility with the Constitution.",
                "As far back as 1956 the Constitutional Court ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law, where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 11 of 1956).",
                "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy. Furthermore, the above two conditions are closely linked. Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 177 of 1980).",
                "The case-law of the Court of Cassation is in this respect entirely consistent with that of the Constitutional Court; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence, any violation of those rights entailing their nullity (see, for example, Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1255 of 29 June 1984 in the Santoro case).",
                "The Court of Cassation has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. In particular, it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the rights of the defence, since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal (Court of Cassation, previously cited Pipitone judgment).",
                "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property (Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution), the Court of Cassation has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest.

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

Pursuant to the general provisions of the Criminal Code, confiscation is a form of an auxiliary penal sanction which may only be imposed for serious or particularly serious criminal offences. The offence of smuggling was neither and moreover Article 188 of the Criminal Code did not provide for confiscation as a sanction. Furthermore, confiscation could be ordered if the defendant was given a suspended sentence, as it was in the applicant ’ s case. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the Petrenko case could not be a lawful basis because it had not been officially published and had also been issued in breach of the binding instructions of the Plenary Supreme Court (no. 19 of 16 August 1984)."

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, as a recent authority, Broniowski v.

The Court emphasises that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be “lawful”: the second paragraph recognises that the States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the foundations of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. The issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights only becomes relevant once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see, among other authorities, Baklanov v. Russia, no. 68443/01, § 39, 9 June 2005, and Frizen v. Russia, no. 58254/00, § 33, 24 March 2005)."

Moreover, the Court reiterates that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” within the meaning of the Convention unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; an individual must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, §§ 43-45, ECHR 2004-VI)."

The first-instance court ordered confiscation of the entire amount without specifying the legal basis for the measure. The appeal court filled in the lacuna and indicated that the money should be confiscated as “criminally acquired” in accordance with Article 86 (4) of the then effective Code of Criminal Procedure. The supervisory-review instance upheld that finding but replaced the word “confiscated” with the expression “reverted to the State” with a view to bringing the text of the judgment in line with Article 86 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, § 51). In other cases, where a confiscation measure had been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” (within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, the Court has again held that such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and in such cases, also, the measure had to be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § § 94 and 97 )."

As to the criminal origin of the assets, the judge held that previous domestic case-law had established that in order to find someone guilty of money laundering it was not necessary to have a previous conviction for the underlying, predicate offence, or to know its perpetrator. It sufficed instead to have reasonable evidence ( prove logiche ) of the criminal origin of the money in question. The criminal origin of the money was an objective prerequisite to be autonomously ascertained by the judge in the money laundering case. It was thus not important to ascertain a specific predicate offence if a plurality of elements showed the illicit origin of the money. In the case at hand, the criminal origin of the assets had been shown by the above-mentioned Italian criminal judgment against B. together with other relevant elements. In particular, the judge quoted a part of the Italian judgment which described the criminal career of B. and his previous convictions for inter alia, fighting, causing personal injury, carrying of weapons and, after 1975, handling and receiving stolen goods, multiple instances of theft, owning unjustified assets and drug dealing."

This fact, however, could not lead to exclude the criminal origin of all the sum at issue since, inter alia, ( i ) B. ’ s criminal record from 1975 included multiple offences each of which was able to produce a relevant criminal profit; (ii) a disproportion existed between the legitimate income of the applicants (and their family) and the assets in their possession; (iii) the applicants had tried to demonstrate the licit origin of the assets (such as from their family business and the sale of immovable property) but their explanation had not relied on any evidence and there had been some contradictions between the statements made by each applicant ’ s legal counsel in this respect; (iv) it was unreasonable that the applicants had decided to deposit the money in a foreign bank far from the centre of interest of their family ’ s businesses and this was a further indication of their attempt to hide the criminal origin of the assets."

Nevertheless, the court noted that the sum deposited in the bank account had had a criminal origin in the absence of any explanation as to the origin of the money (which led to the purchase of properties, the sale of which resulted in the sums at issue). Indeed the fact that relevant fiscal controls did not exist at the time did not suffice to prove the licit origin of the funds.

He further considered that the confiscation, independently from any investigation concerning the possessor, his/her criminal liability or dangerousness, constituted a mere consequence of the status ( condizione giuridica ) of the property and therefore was devoid of any punitive nature. As argued by the Attorney General, “crime cannot pay” – in all European States laundered money could not be allowed to circulate.

Relying on European Court of Human Rights case-law, the judge for extraordinary remedies held that, contrary to the argument raised by the applicants, judicial interpretation of laws did not go against the principle of legal certainty when it was justified by the need to adapt laws to the existing realities, socio-economic needs or international obligations. Given the context, the measure had been necessary in a democratic society. The criminal pervasiveness of the conduct at issue and the multiplier effect on criminal activities, their adverse impact on the regularity of economic activities, the destabilising effects on the economic market and the negative impact on the image of the country and its international credibility were all convincing and imperative reasons justifying the measure.",

It follows that the applicants could be charged with new acts of money laundering had they to use or transfer such money. Against this legal background, the Court confirms the preventive character of such a confiscation designed to prevent the unlawful use of these proceeds, an aim also sought by various international instruments (see paragraphs 38 ‑ 40 above) (compare also, Gogitidze and Others v. Georgia, no. 36862/05, § 101, 12 May 2015). In such circumstances and particularly in view of the applicant ’ s acquittal precisely on the basis of the lack of intention, it cannot be said that the measure also included a punitive purpose (see, a contrario, Sofia v. San Marino ( dec. ), no. 38977/15, § 63, 2 May 2017, and Vannucci v. San Marino, ( dec. ), no. 33898/15, 28 March 2017, concerning a confiscation of laundered assets, or the equivalent, respectively, under Article 147 (3) of the Criminal Code which were applicable after conviction, and Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, where the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking followed a finding of guilt and its amount depended on the degree of culpability of the applicant)."

            [
                "63. As regards the procedures for the adoption and enforcement of the confiscation measure, the Court observes that, undeniably, the measure is meted out by the courts of criminal jurisdiction. However, this cannot in itself be decisive (see by implication, Dassa Foundations and Others v. Liechtenstein, ( dec. ), no. 696/05, 10 July 2007). Indeed, it is a common feature of several jurisdictions for criminal courts to take decisions of a non ‑ punitive nature as, for example, the possibility for criminal courts to order civil reparation measures for the victim of the criminal act. Furthermore, the Court observes that in the present case those courts had to assess the origin of the funds, and during those proceedings, which the applicants have not considered unfair, and during which the applicants have had the right to present their defence, it was established that the origin of the funds had been illicit. This decision was based on the evidence related to their father ’ s dealings, including a criminal judgment against him, and the applicants ’ inability to prove the lawful origin of the money. Thus, the assessment had been objective and based on relevant evidence in the absence of a successful rebuttal, and therefore must be distinguished from mere suspicions or subjective speculation (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Italy, cited above)."

            [
                "64. Lastly, as regards the severity of the measure, the Court reiterates that this factor is not in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 82, ECHR 2013). The Court considers that the confiscation of the sums in the present case is not sufficiently severe as to warrant its classification as a criminal penalty. The Court has previously held that confiscation is not a measure confined to the sphere of criminal law, but that it is encountered widely in the sphere of administrative law where items liable to confiscation include illegally imported goods (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108), items considered dangerous in themselves (such as weapons, explosive or infected cattle) and property connected, even if only indirectly, with a criminal activity (see M. v. Italy, Yildirim, and Bowler International Unit, all cited above, and more recently Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § 126 ). Each confiscation must be seen in its context; money laundering directly threatens the rule of law as is also evident by the action of the Council of Europe and other international bodies in this field. In particular the Council of Europe Conventions on the matter have bound States to criminalise the laundering of the proceeds of crime and provide for other measures aimed at having a strong criminal policy to combat this growing national and international phenomenon the complexities of which are unprecedented (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 181, 13 April 2017). In such circumstances the Court considers that the preventive measure was necessary and appropriate given the public interest involved (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Italy (cited above) and Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § 103)."

The measure was independent of any liability of the applicants for the offence of money laundering and did not reflect the opinion that the applicants were guilty of such offence, in respect of which they were acquitted by the same judge. This was even more so given the preventive nature of the measure. The Government relied on the findings of the judge for extraordinary remedies and reiterated their submissions under Article 7."

Regarded as a procedural safeguard in the context of the criminal trial itself, the presumption of innocence also has another aspect. Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fair ‑ trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person ’ s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 § 2 in this connection may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 314 )."

The Court considers that in the present case there is no doubt that the applicants have been acquitted of the charges related to money laundering and nothing in the appeal judgment suggests otherwise, including the order for the confiscation of their assets. Indeed the Court notes that the confiscation measure in the present case was not based on a judicial finding that the applicants had derived any advantage from offences of which they had been acquitted (see, a contrario, Geerings, cited above, §§ 46-50) but solely on the basis that, according to domestic law and in the spirit of international standards in the battle against money laundering, those funds should not remain in circulation since they had been found to be illicit and their use - after such provenance had been established - would have been constitutive of an offence. Moreover, quite apart from being preventive and not punitive (see paragraph 65 above), the confiscation concerned funds in the applicants ’ possession which were found to be illicit as a result of crimes not attributed to the applicants, but to third persons (who had committed the predicate offence of the money laundering with which the applicants were charged). In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the applicants ’ presumption of innocence has not been breached by the mere imposition of a confiscation order over the illicit assets."

The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions.

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, § 51). In other cases, where a confiscation measure had been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” (within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, the Court has again held that such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and in such cases, also, the measure had to be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § § 94 and 97 )."

In that connection, the court noted that at the time the development plans had been adopted (20 March 1990), Regional Law no. 30 / 1990 on landscape protection had not yet entered into force.

Land planning was regulated by a series of administrative acts which, on the basis of the broader land-use plan, led to the adoption of decisions on individual cases. The criminal courts had no power to waive the implementation of the administrative decision authorising individual projects, save where it was deemed non-existent or invalid ( Court of Cassation, Ligresti and Others, cited above). In so far as the unlawful site development encroached on the powers of the public authorities in matters of land planning, the offence was made out where a new developed area was created without any preventive supervision on the part of the municipality ( Court of Cassation, 1980, Peta, and Court of Cassation, Brunotti, cited above ).

According to that line of case-law, the “ procedural ” material offence of unlawful site development should be regarded as a residual hypothesis in relation to “contractual” unlawful site development.",

In this scenario, the development project exclusively stems from a legal procedure rather than a physical activity (building work) ( Court of Cassation, 2009, Quarta ). Where legal acts are combined with building activity, the status of “contractual” development shifts to that of “hybrid” unlawful site development (see Court of Cassation, no. 618, 2012).

Lastly, case-law has included in the concept of unlawful development the scenario of changing the intended use of buildings erected in a zone already covered by an approved site development plan. The change may, for instance, involve splitting up a tourist/hotel complex and selling the units separately as private dwellings. Such a change of intended use must be such as to affect the land-use plan. This mode of development fits into either the material or the contractual category of site development depending on whether the emphasis is placed on the existence of constructions ( material element ) or on the manner in which the development project is implemented, that is to say by a legal act (see, to that effect, Court of Cassation, no. 20569, 2015). Even though this mode of development does not involve unauthorised building activity, case-law considers that it is one of the situations provided for in Article 30 of the Construction Code, given that the separate sale of buildings necessarily entails dividing up the land on which they are built ( Farabegoli, cited above ).",

This meant that confiscation could be ordered even if the perpetrator had been acquitted on the grounds of a lack of any mental element (“ perché il fatto non costituisce reato ”).

If it wishes to order confiscation, a criminal court must ascertain that the material element of the offence of unlawful site development is made out, which means that it must establish the existence of all the constituent elements of the unlawful conduct. Under section 18 of Law no. 47 of 1985, the notion of unlawful conduct is not confined to activities carried on without authorisation, but also includes acts in breach of planning regulations and of regional and national norms ( Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above ). In this context, the Court of Cassation has clarified the relationship between the administrative decision authorising site development and the power of the criminal court to make a finding of unlawful site development and to order confiscation. The Court of Cassation has explained that where the planning permission does not comply with other planning regulations, the criminal court may find against the perpetrator of the development and order confiscation without the need for any administrative assessment of the permission granted. Given that the criminal court is not empowered to declare the permission null and void, it will remain valid ( Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above; Court of Cassation, Varvara, cited above; and Court of Cassation, no. 36366, 2015, Faiola ).",

Thus, once the conviction has become final, the confiscation measure can no longer be revoked, even in the case of subsequent regularisation of the development by the administrative authority (Court of Cassation, no. 21125, 2007, Licciardello; Court of Cassation, no. 37274, 2008, Varvara and Franzese, cited above )."

                "Whilst differing as regards the effects which the Varvara judgment supposedly generates within the national legal order, both referring courts are convinced that in making this judgment the Strasbourg Court laid down a principle of law which was both innovative and binding on the courts required to apply it by adopting a new approach to the interpretation of Article 7 ECHR.",
                "The first misunderstanding attributable to the referring courts relates to the meaning which they have inferred from the judgment of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "Ultimately, the European Court is alleged to have asserted that, once a sanction has been classified under Article 7 ECHR, and thus once a ‘ penalty ’ has been deemed to fall within its scope, it can only be imposed by a criminal court at the same time as a conviction for an offence. As a result, confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions – which until now has continued to operate as an administrative penalty under national law, which may be imposed first and foremost by the public administration, albeit buttressed by the guarantees provided by Article 7 ECHR – is claimed to have been incorporated in full into the area of criminal law or, to put it differently, the substantive protection guaranteed by Article 7 is claimed to have been supplemented by a further formal safeguard consisting in the reservation of competence over the application of the measure comprising a ‘ penalty ’ to the criminal courts, thus meaning that they can only be imposed at the same time as a conviction.",
                "This is claimed to result in a corollary: as soon as the administrative offence, which the legislator distinguishes with broad discretion from a criminal offence (see Order no. 159 of 1994; followed by Judgments no. 273 of 2010, no. 364 of 2004 and no. 317 of 1996; and Orders no. 212 of 2004 and no. 177 of 2003), was capable of providing self-standing criteria for classifying the ‘ offence ’ under the ECHR, it would be attracted into the scope of the criminal law of the contracting state. This accordingly supposedly results in a merger between the concept of criminal sanction on national level and that on European level. As a result, the area of criminal law is claimed to have expanded beyond the discretionary evaluations of legislators, even in cases involving sanctions that, whilst minor, would still constitute ‘ penalties ’ for the purposes of Article 7 ECHR on other grounds (Grand Chamber, judgment of 23 November 2006 in Jussila v. Finland ).",
                "In asserting this argument, the referring courts do not appreciate that its compatibility both with the Constitution and with the ECHR itself, as interpreted in the rulings of the Strasbourg Court, would be questionable.",

Germany, the Strasbourg Court has developed specific criteria for establishing when a sanction can be classified as a ‘ penalty ’ within the meaning of Article 7 ECHR precisely in order to ensure that the wide-scale processes of decriminalisation which have been launched by the member states since the 1960s do not have the effect of depriving offences of the substantive guarantees assured by Articles 6 and 7 ECHR after decriminalisation (see Öztürk [ cited above ] ).",
                "Thus, the discretion of national legislators to stem the proliferation of the criminal law through the recourse to regimes of sanctions considered to be more appropriate, with reference both to the nature of the sanction imposed and the simplified procedures applicable during the initial administrative stage in which the sanction is imposed, has not been called into question. The aim has rather been to avoid this route from resulting in the dissipation of the bundle of protection which had historically been associated with the development of criminal law, the protection of which ECHR is intended to further.",

                "It is in fact a consolidated principle that the ‘ penalty ’ may also be applied by an administrative authority, albeit upon condition that an appeal may be lodged against the decision before a court of law offering the guarantees provided for under Article 6 ECHR, even if it does not necessarily exercise criminal jurisdiction (see most recently the judgment of 4 March 2014 in Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, with reference to a sanction considered to be serious). It has been added that the ‘ penalty ’ may result from the completion of an administrative procedure even without any formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court (see the judgment of 11 January 2007 in Mamidakis v. Greece ).",
                "6.2.– ... Expressions of this type, which are linguistically open to an interpretation that does not require a finding of responsibility exclusively in the form of a criminal conviction, are entirely consistent in logical terms with the Strasbourg Court ’ s function of perceiving the violation of the human right in its tangible dimension, irrespective of the abstract formula used by the national legislator to classify the conduct.",
                "This Court must conclude that the referring courts were not only not required to infer the principle of law on which the current interlocutory questions of constitutionality are based from the Varvara judgment but should also have read the judgment as having the opposite effect. In fact, this judgment is compatible with the text of the decision and the facts of the case ruled upon, which is more in keeping with the traditional logic underpinning the case-law of the European Court, and in any case respects the constitutional principle of subsidiarity in the area of criminal law, as well as the legislative discretion over the policy on the punishment of offences, as the case may be opting to classify the sanction as administrative in nature (for internal purposes).",
                "Within the perspective of the Strasbourg Court, the guarantees which Article 7 ECHR offers in relation to confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions are certainly mandated by the excessive result which such a measure may lead to beyond the restoration of the breach of the law (see the judgment of 20 January 2009 in Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy ), which in turn results from the manner in which that institute is configured under Italian law.",
                "However, they do not detract from the possibility that the power to impose administrative sanctions, which is the task of such a measure prior to any involvement by the criminal courts, may indeed be linked to the public interest in the ‘ construction planning of the territory ’ (see Judgment no. 148 of 1994), the furtherance of which is a task for the public administration. It is important to add that this interest is by no means foreign to the ECHR perspective (see the judgment of 8 November 2005 in Saliba v. Malta ).",
                "As things currently stand, unless there are any further developments in the case-law of the European court (following the referral to the Grand Chamber of disputes relating to national confiscations based on spatial planning provisions in applications no. 19029/11, no. 34163/07 and no. 1828/06), the argument proposed by the referring courts as a starting point for their doubts concerning the constitutionality of the contested provisions that the Varvara judgment may be unequivocally interpreted to the effect that confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions may only be ordered in parallel with a conviction by the courts for the offence of unlawful parcelling must accordingly be concluded to be mistaken.",
                "7.– ... It is not always immediately clear whether a certain interpretation of the provisions of the ECHR has become sufficiently consolidated at Strasbourg, especially in cases involving rulings intended to resolve cases that turn on highly specific facts, which have moreover been adopted with reference to the impact of the ECHR on legal systems different from that of Italy. In spite of this, there are without doubt signs that are capable of directing the national courts during their examination: the creativity of the principle asserted compared to the traditional approach of European case-law; the potential for points of distinction or even contrast from other rulings of the Strasbourg Court; the existence of dissenting opinions, especially if fuelled by robust arguments; the fact that the decision made originates from an ordinary division and has not been endorsed by the Grand Chamber; the fact that, in the case before it, the European court has not been able to assess the particular characteristics of the national legal system, and has extended to it criteria for assessment devised with reference to other member states which, in terms of those characteristics, by contrast prove to be little suited to Italy.",
                "When all or some of these signs are apparent, as established in a judgment which cannot disregard the specific features of each individual case, there is no reason to require the ordinary courts to use the interpretation chosen by the Strasbourg Court in order to resolve a particular dispute, unless it relates to a ‘ pilot judgment ’ in a strict sense.”",

Without an autonomous concept of penalty, States would be free to impose penalties without classifying them as such, and the individuals concerned would then be deprived of the safeguards under Article 7 § 1.

The Italian Court of Cassation itself had acknowledged that the existing legislation was obscure and poorly worded. The applicants further observed that the sanction of confiscation had been imposed in the absence of any criminally reprehensible conduct or any liability on the part of the applicant companies. As to Mr Gironda, the measure of deprivation had been imposed following dismissal of the case as statute-barred by the Court of Cassation, which, on quashing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, had clearly reproached the applicant for his conduct but without finding any “substantive” liability in the operative part of its judgment."

Applying this notion to that particular case, it agreed with the findings of the Italian Court of Cassation that, as the rules that had been breached lacked foreseeability, the accused had committed an unavoidable and excusable error, thus ruling out the mental element that had to be established for the offence to be made out, and their acquittal was justified (ibid., §§ 111- 14). The Court further found as follows:",
                "“ 115. A connected series of ideas should be developed. At domestic level, the classification ‘ administrative ’ ... that is given to the impugned confiscation measure allows the sanction in question to fall outside the constitutional principles governing criminal matters. Article 27/1 of the Constitution provides that ‘ criminal liability is personal ’ and the courts ’ interpretation thereof is that a mental element is always necessary. Moreover, it would be difficult to apply Article 27/3 of the Constitution ( ‘ Punishments .... must be aimed at the rehabilitation of the convicted person ’ ) to a convicted person if he or she cannot be found liable.",
                "116. As regards the Convention, Article 7 does not expressly mention any mental link between the material element of the offence and the person deemed to have committed it. Nevertheless, the rationale of the sentence and punishment, and the ‘ guilty ’ concept (in the English version) and the corresponding notion of ‘ personne coupable ’ (in the French version), support an interpretation whereby Article 7 requires, for the purposes of punishment, an intellectual link ( awareness and intent) disclosing an element of liability in the conduct of the perpetrator of the offence, failing which the penalty will be unjustified. Moreover, it would be inconsistent, on the one hand, to require an accessible and foreseeable legal basis and, on the other, to allow an individual to be found ‘ guilty ’ and to ‘ punish ’ him even though he had not been in a position to know the criminal law owing to an unavoidable error for which the person falling foul of it could in no way be blamed.",

Under Article 7, for the reasons set out above, a legislative framework which does not enable an accused person to know the meaning and scope of the criminal law is defective not only on the grounds of the general conditions of ‘ quality ’ of the ‘ law ’ but also in terms of the specific requirements of the principle of legality in criminal law.”"

The Grand Chamber endorses the analysis to the effect that the rationale of the sentence and punishment, and the ‘ guilty ’ concept (in the English version) with the corresponding notion of ‘ personne coupable ’ (in the French version), support an interpretation whereby Article 7 requires, for the purposes of punishment, a mental link. As is explained in the Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment ( merits, cited above ), the principle that offences and sanctions must be provided for by law entails that criminal law must clearly define the offences and the sanctions by which they are punished, such as to be accessible and foreseeable in its effects. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. This also means that, in principle, a measure can only be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 where an element of personal liability on the part of the offender has been established. There is certainly, as the Italian Court of Cassation noted in the case of Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others ( see paragraph 112 of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, ibid. ), a clear correlation between the degree of foreseeability of a criminal-law provision and the personal liability of the offender. The Grand Chamber thus shares the Chamber ’ s findings in that case to the effect that punishment under Article 7 requires the existence of a mental link through which an element of liability may be detected in the conduct of the person who physically committed the offence ( ibid., § 116)."

Nevertheless, and as the Court indicated in its Varvara judgment ( cited above, § 70), this requirement does not preclude the existence of certain forms of objective liability stemming from presumptions of liability, provided they comply with the Convention. In this connection, the Court would refer to its case-law under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention to the effect that in principle the Contracting States remain free to apply the criminal law to an act where it is not carried out in the normal exercise of one of the rights protected under the Convention ( see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 81, Series A no. 22, p. 34 ) and, accordingly, to define the constituent elements of the resulting offence. In particular, the Contracting States may, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence. Examples of such offences may be found in the laws of the Contracting States. Presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. The Convention does not prohibit such presumptions in principle; it does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law. According to the case-law, these limits will be overstepped where a presumption has the effect of making it impossible for an individual to exonerate himself from the accusations against him, thus depriving him of the benefit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, § § 27 -28, Series A no. 141 -A; Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, § 68; ECHR 2002 - VII and Klouvi v. France, no. 30754/03, § 48, 30 June 2011 )."

The Court, for its part, must ensure that the declaration of criminal liability complies with the safeguards provided for in Article 7 and that it stems from proceedings complying with Article 6.

The Court considered that the criminal sanction imposed on the heirs for tax fraud attributed to the deceased was incompatible with the fundamental rule of criminal law that criminal liability does not survive the person who has committed the criminal act (ibid., § 48). Swiss law explicitly acknowledged this principle, and the Court affirmed that this rule was also required by the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. Inheritance of the guilt of the dead is not compatible with the standards of criminal justice in a society governed by the rule of law. That principle was reaffirmed in the case of Lagardère ( Lagardère v. France, no. 18851/07, 12 April 2012, § 77), in which the Court reiterated that the rule that criminal liability does not survive the person who has committed the criminal act is not only required by the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, but also by the principle that inheritance of the guilt of the dead is incompatible with the standards of criminal justice in a society governed by the rule of law.",

Italy, 6 November 1980, § 100, Series A no. 39), the Court considers that the rule reiterated by it in the preceding paragraph is also valid from the angle of Article 7 of the Convention, which requires that no one can be held guilty of a criminal offence committed by another. While it is true that anyone must be able at any time to ascertain what is permitted and what is prohibited via clear and detailed laws, a system which punished persons for an offence committed by another would be inconceivable.”"

It argued that, by allowing, through a general formulation, the extension of such confiscation beyond the land directly concerned by the unlawful development, section 19 of Law no. 47/1985 infringed Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That Article allowed legitimate interference only on the basis of a law that was accessible, precise and foreseeable. The applicant company took the view that section 19 should have indicated in greater detail the limits within which it was possible to decide on confiscation in relation to the established facts, by indicating, according to a principle of reason and proportionality, the extent of the land that could be confiscated in relation to the buildings erected thereon and the unlawful conduct as established in material and mental terms. It explained that the lack of clarity and precision of the national law, and of the regional law, which had been regarded by the Court as “obscure and poorly worded” in its Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment ( merits, cited above ), had made it possible to confiscate land of an area that was three times as large as that covered by the planning permission issued by the Bari municipal authority.

In the Varvara judgment ( cited above ), but also in the Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment ( merits, cited above ), it had established that the offence in respect of which the penalty had been imposed had no legal basis, in breach of the Convention, and that the penalty imposed on the applicant had been arbitrary. That finding had then led the Court to state that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions was equally arbitrary and that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, the applicant companies took the view that a State ’ s interference with the right to enjoyment of property had to strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the imperatives of guaranteeing the individual ’ s fundamental rights. They explained that, in the present case, the extent of the confiscation affecting the property had to be taken into account : the eighty-eight plots that were built upon totalled 15, 920 sq. m, while the confiscation had affected an additional area that was 14. 5 times as large."

As to the proportionality aspect, the Government explained that less restrictive measures could not have been envisaged. In their view, it would have been technically very difficult, if not impossible, to limit the confiscation merely to the areas that had been built upon and to have separated those areas from the undeveloped land. In the Government ’ s view, a purely partial confiscation of the land would have frustrated the legitimate aims pursued by the State, namely to ensure the conformity of the plots in question with the planning regulations, environmental protection and the punishment of those responsible for the unlawful land transformation.

The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98, and Iatridis v.

The Court notes that the present case can be distinguished from that of AGOSI v. the United Kingdom (24 October 1986, Series A no. 108), where confiscation was ordered in respect of property that was the subject-matter of an offence ( objectum sceleris ), following the conviction of the persons charged, for in the present case the confiscation was ordered following acquittal.

France ((dec.), no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII) or Air Canada v. the United Kingdom (5 May 1995, Series A no. 316 ‑ A), in which the confiscation, ordered after the conviction of the accused, concerned property which was the instrumentum sceleris and was in the possession of third parties. As regards the proceeds of crime ( productum sceleris ), the Court observes that it has examined a case where the confiscation had followed the applicant ’ s conviction (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, §§ 9-18, ECHR 2001-VII) and cases where confiscation had been ordered independently of the existence of any criminal proceedings, because the applicant companies ’ property had been presumed to be of unlawful origin (see Riela and Others v.

In his view, by substituting its own ruling for that of the court below in a non ‑ customary manner, the Court of Cassation had established the existence of all the necessary elements for the offence of unlawful site development to be made out, that is, in both its material and mental elements. The applicant explained that, according to the Court of Cassation, the change in use of the buildings was proved by the statements of third parties and by the documents in the file. In that court ’ s view, according to the applicant, the unlawful nature of the development was not in doubt.

                "314. Article 6 § 2 protects the right of any person to be “ presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law ”. Regarded as a procedural safeguard in the context of the criminal trial itself, the presumption of innocence also has another aspect. Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fair ‑ trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person ’ s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 § 2 in this connection may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see, for example, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62902/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII; Taliadorou and Stylianou v. Cyprus, nos. 39627/05 and 39631/05, §§ 27 and 56-59, 16 October 2008; and Allen, cited above, §§ 93 ‑ 94 )."

By way of example, in the case of Didu v. Romania ( no. 34814/02, §§ 40-42, 14 April 2009 ), the Court found that the fact that the court ruling at last instance had quashed the acquittal decisions by the lower courts, and had found the person concerned guilty whilst closing the proceedings because criminal liability was statute-barred, had breached Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, since the defence rights had not been respected in the proceedings before it, even though that last-instance court was the first court to have found the applicant guilty. Similarly, in Giosakis v. Greece (no. 3) (no. 5689/08, § 41, 3 May 2011), the Court found that Article 6 § 2 of the Convention had been breached by the fact that the Court of Cassation had quashed the acquittal by the Court of Appeal whereas it had at the same time found the proceedings to be statute-barred."

As to whether the control of property in issue pursued a legitimate aim, the Court notes that under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of the control of property. Here, the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation and the Court will respect their judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This necessarily applies, and perhaps to a greater extent, in the event of changes to a country ’ s political system (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 87, ECHR 2000-XII). As for the requirement of proportionality, any interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure interfering with property rights of individuals (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, § 38, and Malama, cited above, § 48). In determining whether both requirements are met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing how the measures are to be implemented and to ascertaining whether the consequences of implementation are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III). Under the Court ’ s case-law, the character of interference, the aim pursued, the nature of property rights interfered with, and the behaviour of the applicant and the interfering State authorities are among the principle factors material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants."

None the less, they maintained that, despite the fact that neither the Supreme Court nor the Constitutional Court had clarified in their respective case-law at the time the seizure had been imposed whether book -entry shares fell within the scope of that provision, the case-law of the ordinary courts had answered this question in the affirmative, as evidenced by the Prosecutor General ’ s interpretative guideline (see paragraph 5 2 above). The principles enshrined in this case ‑ law were subsequently embodied in the CCP, with the amendment which entered into force on 1 January 1998. Moreover, the interpretation of book-entry shares as movable items was also borne out by the records of the debate preceding the adoption of the Securities Act in Parliament.

They further asserted that the seizure of items had been subject to judicial control under Article 80 of the CCP and, subsequently, from 1 January 2002 onwards, under Article 79c taken in conjunction with Article 79a of the CCP. As regards the procedural safeguards available to the applicant company, the Government maintained that the seizure could have been appealed before the Constitutional Court and that the applicant company could have lodged an application under Article 80 of the CCP requesting that the seizure be lifted or, after 1 January 2002, challenged the decision to seize under Article 79c of the CCP directly.",

In their view, the seizure was justified as it was indispensable for securing the enforcement of the outcome of the criminal proceedings against H. and others who, through transfers of securities, had inflicted damage to the detriment of the companies concerned amounting to nearly CZK 1.2 billion. Should the seizure be terminated, that enforcement might be frustrated. Referring to the exceptional circumstances of the case, they considered the seizure to be proportionate.

The Court observes that the gist of the applicant company ’ s complaint consists in the allegation that shares in its possession were seized contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and that it lost all control over them as a result of that seizure. The freezing of the shares thus amounted, in the applicant company ’ s view, to de facto deprivation of its property. The Government asserted that the situation constituted a control of property within the meaning of the third sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court notes that the applicant company did not allege that it had lost its status as holder of the shares. It further observes that not all of the rights relating to the shares were suspended by the original seizure, the applicant company having been entitled, inter alia, to receive dividends, to challenge resolutions of general meetings or to propose the convening of general meetings. Moreover, the voting rights attached to the shares were suspended only in June 2006. Therefore, the Court considers that the situation in question could not be regarded as a deprivation of property. Accordingly, it is the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which is applicable (see Capital Bank AD v.

Ukraine, no. 48553/99, § 95, ECHR 2002-VII). However, that does not dispense with the need for the Court to determine whether the interference in issue complied with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (ibid.). The Court further recalls that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful (see Capital Bank AD v.

                "65. Moreover, the Court reiterates that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” within the meaning of the Convention unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; an individual must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The Court further reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, for example, Cantoni v. France, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, § 35, and Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, §§ 43-45, ECHR 2004-VI)."

                "66. Turning to the specific facts of the case, the Court observes that the first issue in dispute under the invoked provision is whether Article 79 of the CCP provided a legal basis for the seizure of book -entry shares, in particular whether the term “item” contained therein encompassed such shares. It notes that neither the Criminal Code nor the CCP specified before 1 January 1998 whether the prosecuting authorities were empowered to seize book -entry shares, the statutes in question providing for the seizure of “items ” in general. Nor did the case-law of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court clarify the issue at that time. As to the existence of the domestic courts ’ practice alleged by the Government with reference to the Prosecutor General ’ s interpretative guideline, the Court accepts that the requirements of foreseeability and clarity of the law may be satisfied if the matter in question can be solved by means of the application of principles enshrined in settled domestic practice, including a practice having a certain degree of authoritative effect."

            [
                "67. However, notwithstanding the question whether the guideline reflected the practice of the domestic authorities, the Court observes that the Government did not show that the guideline had been issued at the time of the original seizure in 1997 and that it had been published at that time in the Official Gazette or other publicly accessible standardised law resource. The same conclusion must be made with regard to the ordinary courts ’ practice referred to by the Government and by the Constitutional Court in the reasoning of its decision rejecting the applicant company ’ s constitutional appeal. Consequently, the Court is not in a position to conclude that the case-law whose existence is alleged by the Government could have made the interpretation of Article 79 of the CCP unequivocal, as that case-law must be considered inaccessible to the applicant at the time of the original seizure. Furthermore as regards Czech practice, the Court observes that, when they were published in 1998, the legal opinions adduced by the Government (see paragraphs 53 – 55) had not arrived at the same conclusions when addressing the issue whether the term “ item ” in Article 79 of the CCP encompassed book-entry shares before 1 January 1998. That jurisprudence cannot therefore be regarded as interpreting unambiguously the scope of application of Article 79 of the CCP before 1 January 1998. In these circumstances, the Court observes that at least two interpretations of the scope of application of Article 79 of the CPC existed at the relevant time.",
                "None the less, this does not suffice in order to conclude that the law was not foreseeable or was arbitrary (see O. B. Heller, a.s. and Československá obchodní banka, a.s. v. the Czech Republic ( dec .), no. 5631/00, 9 November 2004). The Court notes in this regard that the seizure took place in consequence of the business transaction concluded by the applicant company in the course of its professional activities. Given the unsettled business environment of the Czech Republic of 1990 and the considerable volume of that transaction, it considers that the applicant company, if dealing with due care, presupposing inter alia legal assistance, could not be regarded as lacking a reasonable opportunity to foresee the consequences of acquiring the securities, including the impossibility of ruling out the risk that the securities might be subsequently seized. This conclusion applies a fortiori to the situation after 1 January 1998, when Article 89 § 1 3 of the Criminal Code was amended so as to bring securities within the ambit of the provisions governing items, and even more so with the entry into force on 1 January 2002 of Article 79c of the CCP providing explicitly for the seizure of book -entry shares."

                "69. The Court recalls that the requirement of lawfulness, within the meaning of the Convention, presupposes, among other things, that the national law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by the public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000-XI). Moreover, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental rights be, in certain cases, subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the measures and the relevant evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 123, 20 June 2002). It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192, § 50 ). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002-IV)."

                "70. In the instant case, it was not disputed by the parties that the decision on seizure under Article 79 of the CCP could not be contested under the CCP. The Court observes that according to that provision a decision on seizure during the pre-trial proceedings is reserved to the prosecutor. Such a decision cannot be contested under the CCP as it is, according to domestic practice, a decision sui generis, not a decision within the meaning of Article 119 § 2 of the CCP (see paragraph 5 4 above ).",
                "Moreover, a complaint against a prosecutor ’ s decision is, according to Article 141 § 2 of the CCP, permissible only in cases where the law so provides. Article 79 of the CCP does not provide for such a complaint in relation to seizures. As regards Article 80 of the CCP, the Court observes that it provides, inter alia, for the lifting of a seizure measure in pre-trial proceedings by the prosecutor when the seized item is no longer required for the criminal proceedings and its expropriation or confiscation can be ruled out. Thus, it is a legal instrument which makes it possible, not to appeal directly a decision on seizure, but rather to react to a change in the circumstances under which an item was seized. Furthermore, decisions under Article 80 of the CCP and appeals against them are adopted by a prosecutor (see paragraph 4 8 above) and not by a court, at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings. It is true that the seizure of book -entry shares became reviewable by a court with the amendment of the CCP, which introduced Article 79c CCP taken in conjunction with Article 79a of the CCP and with Article 146a of the CCP as amended. However, the correspondingly worded legal provisions entered into force only on 1 January 2002. The applicant company thus cannot be considered to have enjoyed under Czech criminal law as it stood at the time of the seizure sufficient procedural guarantees within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1"

                "71. As for the right to challenge the seizure by means of a constitutional appeal, the Court observes that the applicant availed itself twice of this remedy without success (see paragraphs 16 and 2 3 ). The Court observes that the task of the Constitutional Court, when dealing with appeals filed under section 72(1) of the Constitutional Court Act, is, in principle, to review constitutionality of an impugned measure. As a general rule, it is not the function of that court to deal with errors in fact or law asserted in such an appeal. Therefore, it is doubtful whether such a review provides, on its own, individuals or entities with a reasonable opportunity to challenge effectively measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
                "However, in the instant case, where the facts were not disputed by the parties, the Constitutional Court did address the issue in law, raised by the applicant company in the constitutional appeals, when it found in its decision of 15 April 2004 that the contested seizure was from the very beginning legal (see paragraph 2 3 ). It is true that in its first ruling of 11 November 1998 the Constitutional Court did not proceed so when it refused to review the legality of the seizure as it declared the first constitutional appeal before it inadmissible as being lodged outside the time-limit provided for by the Constitutional Court Act. However, the examination of that decision by the Court is barred by the fact that the present application was lodged on 22 October 2004, i.e. outside the six-month time-limit provided for in Article 3 5 § 1 of the Convention."

            [
                "75. As to whether the control of property in issue pursued a legitimate aim, the Court notes that under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of the control of property. Here, the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation and the Court will respect their judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This necessarily applies, and perhaps to a greater extent, in the event of changes to a country ’ s political system (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 87, ECHR 2000-XII). As for the requirement of proportionality, any interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure interfering with property rights of individuals (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, § 38, and Malama, cited above, § 48). In determining whether both requirements are met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing how the measures are to be implemented and to ascertaining whether the consequences of implementation are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III). Under the Court ’ s case-law, the character of interference, the aim pursued, the nature of property rights interfered with, and the behaviour of the applicant and the interfering State authorities are among the principle factors material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants."

            [
                "76. Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court observes that the Government ’ s assertion regarding a legitimate aim refers to policies which are essential for the proper functioning of all Contracting Parties. It further notes that at the time of the seizure the Czech Republic undertook systemic social and economic reforms one of whose side effects was an increase of serious economic crime. Moreover, although the Court accepts that the two victims of the transaction, MERCIA and TREND, might be regarded as having waived their rights with regard to the applicant company following their settlement agreements (see paragraphs 3 2 -3 4 ), it was not shown by the applicant company that all reasons for the seizure thereby ceased to exist, as is evidenced, inter alia, by the legal actions brought before the courts by the minority shareholders of MERCIA and TREND in order to contest the settlement agreements concluded with the applicant company (paragraph 3 3 ). It follows that the seizure must be considered as pursuing a legitimate aim within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Its voting rights attached to the shares were suspended on 15 June 2006 while other rights attached to the shares, such as the right to be paid dividends and to challenge resolutions of general meeting, were retained by the applicant company.",
                "The Court acknowledges the importance of conducting investigations of suspected serious economic crimes, as in the instant case, with due diligence in order to ensure that these crimes are properly assessed and the proceedings duly terminated. Nevertheless, the Court, taking into account the length of the seizure of the shares of the applicant company – more than twelve years – and the considerable value of those assets, finds that a fair balance has not been struck in the instant case between the general interests of society and the interests of the applicant company, as the latter has been obliged to bear an excessive burden as a result of the continuing seizure."

Having found that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka were and still are liable for “old” foreign-currency savings in their Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches, it must be examined, as the Chamber did, whether Slovenia and Serbia were responsible for the failure of those banks to repay their debt to the applicants. In this regard, the Court reiterates that a State may be responsible for debts of a State-owned company, even if the company is a separate legal entity, provided that it does not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Mykhaylenky and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 35091/02, 35196/02, 35201/02, 35204/02, 35945/02, 35949/02, 35953/02, 36800/02, 38296/02 and 42814/02, §§ 43-46, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII; Cooperativa Agricola Slobozia-Hanesei v.

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company’s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control)."

Basic banks had separate legal personality, but were integrated into the organisational structure of one of the nine associated banks. As a rule, basic banks were founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit (that is, in one of the Republics – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia – or Autonomous Provinces – Kosovo and Vojvodina – of the SFRY). Socially owned companies were the flagship of the Yugoslav model of self-management: neither private nor State-owned, they were a collective property controlled by their employees, based on a communist vision of industrial relations (the phenomenon and the current status of such companies in Serbia, where they continue to exist, has been described in R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 71-76 and 97, 15 January 2008). Two or more basic banks could form an associated bank.

                "17. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the banks incurred foreign ‑ exchange losses because of depreciation of the dinar exchange rate. In response, the SFRY introduced a system for “redepositing” foreign currency, allowing banks to transfer citizens’ foreign-currency deposits to the NBY, which assumed the currency risk (section 51 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1977 [9] ). Although the system was legally optional, in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign-currency accounts with foreign banks, which were necessary to make payments abroad, nor were they allowed to grant foreign-currency loans. Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the NBY according to one of the following two methods: either the “accounting” or “pro forma” method, or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. The accounting method was used far more often, as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the NBY without having to pay fees to foreign banks (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § 36, 3 October 2008; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53). According to an internal report of the NBY of September 1988 [10], by 30 June 1988 an equivalent of approximately USD 9 billion had been redeposited with the NBY, of which only around USD 1.4 billion (that is, slightly above 15%) had been physically transferred to the NBY’s many foreign accounts. It would appear that the funds in the NBY’s foreign accounts have recently been divided among the successor States (see paragraph 65 below)."

Pursuant to a series of agreements (between Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo and Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, the National Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Bank of Slovenia), Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo was to transfer every month to the National Bank of Slovenia, for the account of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, any difference between the foreign currency deposited and the foreign currency withdrawn. Some of those funds were transferred back to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs (during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited). Indeed, in the period from 1984 to 1991, DEM 244,665,082 was transferred to Ljubljana and DEM 41,469,528 (that is, less than 17%) back to Sarajevo. The funds which had not been transferred back to Sarajevo were redeposited with the NBY according to one of the two methods described in paragraph 17 above: the “accounting” or “pro forma” method (in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left Ljubljana), or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. Regardless of the redepositing method used, all those funds were recorded as a claim of Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo against the NBY."

On 1 January 1990 Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo, mentioned above, thus became a branch (without legal personality) of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana; the latter assumed the former’s rights, assets and liabilities.

For example, as of December 1990, when the amendment to section 71 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1985 came into force, savers could withdraw their savings only to pay for imported goods or services for their own or their close relatives’ needs, to purchase foreign-currency bonds, to make testamentary gifts for scientific or humanitarian purposes, or to pay for life insurance with a local insurance company. In addition, section 3 of the SFRY government’s decision of April 1991 [12], which was in force until February 1992, and section 17(c) of the NBY’s decision of January 1991 [13], which the Constitutional Court of the SFRY declared unconstitutional in April 1992, limited the amount that savers could withdraw or use for the above purposes to DEM 500 per transaction, but not more than DEM 1,000 per month (see paragraph 53 below).",

The National Bank, for that reason, appointed a director of that bank. Secondly, as a domestic bank, Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo could not have assumed a foreign bank’s liability for “old” foreign-currency savings, as this would impose new financial obligations on the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina (as the State was the statutory guarantor for “old” foreign-currency savings in all domestic banks).

The obligation flowing from a pactum de negotiando, to negotiate with a view to concluding an agreement, must be fulfilled in good faith according to the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda. On 26 January 1972 the Arbitral Tribunal for the Agreement on German External Debts in the case of Greece v. the Federal Republic of Germany stated, in this regard, as follows.",
                "“62. ... However, a pactum de negotiando is also not without legal consequences. It means that both sides would make an effort, in good faith, to bring about a mutually satisfactory solution by way of a compromise, even if that meant the relinquishment of strongly held positions earlier taken. It implies a willingness for the purpose of negotiation to abandon earlier positions and to meet the other side part way. The language of the Agreement cannot be construed to mean that either side intends to adhere to its previous stand and to insist upon the complete capitulation of the other side. Such a concept would be inconsistent with the term ‘negotiation’. It would be the very opposite of what was intended. An undertaking to negotiate involves an understanding to deal with the other side with a view to coming to terms. Though the Tribunal does not conclude that Article 19 in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement, it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate, bargain, and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...",

This is true, even though the dispute extends not only to the amount of the claims but to their existence as well. The principle of settlement is not thereby affected. Article 19 does not necessarily require that the parties resolve the various legal questions on which they have disagreed. For example, it does not contemplate that both sides are expected to see eye to eye on certain points separating them, such as whether the disputed claims legally exist or not, or whether they are government or private claims. As to these points, the parties, in effect, have agreed to disagree but, notwithstanding their contentions with regard to them, they did commit themselves to pursue negotiations as far as possible with a view to concluding an agreement on a settlement.",

As enunciated by the International Court of Justice, it confirms and gives substance to the ordinary meaning of ‘negotiation’. To be meaningful, negotiations have to be entered into with a view to arriving at an agreement. Though, as we have pointed out, an agreement to negotiate does not necessarily imply an obligation to reach an agreement, it does imply that serious efforts towards that end will be made.”"

                "“The Court notes that the meaning of negotiations for the purposes of dispute settlement, or the obligation to negotiate, has been clarified through the jurisprudence of the Court and that of its predecessor, as well as arbitral awards. As the Permanent Court of International Justice already stated in 1931 in the case concerning Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, the obligation to negotiate is first of all ‘not only to enter into negotiations, but also to pursue them as far as possible, with a view to concluding agreements’. No doubt this does not imply ‘an obligation to reach an agreement’ ( Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68, para. 150), or that lengthy negotiations must be pursued of necessity ( Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 13). However, States must conduct themselves so that the ‘negotiations are meaningful’. This requirement is not satisfied, for example, where either of the parties ‘insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it’ ( North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 67, para. 146) or where they obstruct negotiations, for example, by interrupting communications or causing delays in an unjustified manner or disregarding the procedures agreed upon ( Lake Lanoux Arbitration (Spain/France) (1957), Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XII, p. 307). Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement also imply that the parties should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other ( Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 33, para. 78). As for the proof required for finding of the existence of bad faith (a circumstance which would justify either Party in claiming to be discharged from performance), ‘something more must appear than the failure of particular negotiations’ (Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol. II, p. 930). It could be provided by circumstantial evidence but should be supported ‘not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion’ (ibid.). ”",

Admittedly, all foreign-currency deposits had been guaranteed by the SFRY, but the guarantee had never been activated as the banks under consideration had remained solvent until the dissolution of the SFRY. Liability had thus not shifted from the banks to the SFRY. Accordingly, the question at stake regarding the applicants’ savings was not a succession issue. They were of the opinion that the Slovenian and Serbian Governments should be held responsible for the debts of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka respectively, since they were responsible for those banks’ inability to service their debts. Notably, the Slovenian government had, by virtue of law, transferred most of the assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana to a new bank (see paragraph 49 above); the Serbian government had written off the debts of State-owned companies to Investbanka in order to be able to privatise them and gain millions in profit."

In this connection, the Croatian Government provided a copy of a report issued by Moody’s in 1997 showing that the assets of Nova Ljubljanska Banka, which had been founded with assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana only a couple of years earlier (see paragraph 49 above), were around USD 3.7 billion."

The mere fact that a State was the owner of a company, and in that sense controlled it, was not sufficient to attribute its activities to the State or to hold the State liable for the company’s debts pursuant to customary international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts."

Turning to the present case, it is to be observed that as a result of different measures adopted at national level the applicants have not been able to use their savings for more than twenty years. While, initially at least, the freezing of the bank accounts could be viewed as intended to control the use of their possessions in the sense of the third rule, it may be questioned whether the fact that their deposits remained unavailable for such a long period did not amount to a “deprivation” in the sense of the second rule. However, bearing in mind the findings in paragraphs 77 to 81 above that the legislation of the respondent States did not extinguish the applicants’ claims or otherwise deprive them of legal validity, as well as those States’ acceptance in principle that deposit holders such as the applicants should also be able to dispose of their savings, it cannot be said that the applicants have been formally deprived of their savings. For the same reasons, the Court does not find that the subject matter could be regarded as clearly amounting to de facto expropriation. Against this background, and in view of the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in this case, the Court considers that the alleged violation of the right of property cannot be classified as falling into a precise category (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 106, ECHR 2000 ‑ I, and Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no. 66610/09, § 47, ECHR 2013).

The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention.

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. It also holds true that the aims mentioned in that provision may be of some relevance in assessing whether a balance between the demands of the public interest involved and the applicant’s fundamental right of property has been struck.

Having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers it unnecessary to categorise its examination of the case strictly as being under the head of positive or negative obligations of the respondent States. The Court will determine whether the conduct of the respondent States – regardless of whether that conduct may be characterised as an interference or as a failure to act, or a combination of both – was justifiable in view of the principles of lawfulness, legitimate aim and “fair balance” (see Broniowski, cited above, § 146).",

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a public interest required under the second sentence, or the general interest referred to in the second paragraph, are corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

Since the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies is wide, the Court will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the public interest, unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Broniowski, cited above, § 149, with further references).

The Court would emphasise that these conclusions are limited to the circumstances of the present case and do not imply that no State will ever be able to rehabilitate a failed bank without incurring under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 direct responsibility for the bank’s debt (see Kotov, cited above, § 116, and Anokhin, cited above) nor, as suggested by Slovenia (see paragraphs 93-94 above), that this provision requires that foreign branches of domestic banks always be included in domestic deposit-guarantee schemes. The Court considers the present case to be special for the following reasons. Firstly, when the applicants deposited their money, the SFRY still existed and the branches in question were not foreign branches. Moreover, Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana was State-owned even before its rehabilitation. Indeed, both that bank and Investbanka have always been either State-owned or socially-owned. The present case is thus evidently different from a standard case of rehabilitation of an insolvent private bank. The EFTA Court’s judgment on which the Slovenian Government relied is of little relevance in the present case as it concerned the rehabilitation of a failed private bank in the particular legal framework applicable to Iceland. Moreover, the savers in issue, unlike the present applicants, had already been repaid by the Dutch and United Kingdom authorities (see paragraphs 71-73 above)."

However, in that case, the Court examined the provisions of the Serbian Old Foreign-Currency Savings Acts concerning those who, unlike the present applicants, qualified for the gradual repayment of their savings by the Serbian authorities. The Court held that given the dire reality of the Serbian economy at the material time and the margin of appreciation afforded to the States in respect of matters involving economic policy, the impugned provisions had struck a fair balance between the general interest and the applicant’s rights. In contrast, Mr Šahdanović did not qualify for such gradual repayment by the Serbian authorities. Thus, the present case must be distinguished from Molnar Gabor."

The explanation of the Serbian and Slovenian Governments for the delay is essentially that the international law on State succession required only that succession issues be negotiated in good faith, without imposing any time-limits for the settlement of such issues. They further argued that their insistence on the responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina for “old” foreign-currency savings in Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches of Slovenian and Serbian banks during succession negotiations was fully in line with the main principle of international law on State succession – the territoriality principle."

While it is true that the 2001 Resolution on State Succession in Matters of Property and Debts of the Institute of International Law provides that the territoriality principle applies specifically to local debts, the applicants’ savings evidently did not belong to that category of State debts (see paragraph 60 above).

Despite that, the Croatian and Macedonian Governments have never abandoned their position that Slovenia should eventually be held liable and have continued to claim compensation for the amounts paid at the inter-State level (notably, in the context of succession negotiations). At the same time, the Slovenian government has repaid the total amount of “old” foreign-currency savings in domestic branches of Investbanka and other foreign banks (see paragraph 48 above) and the Serbian government has agreed to repay the “old” foreign-currency savings in foreign branches of Serbian banks (such as the Tuzla branch of Investbanka) of those who had the citizenship of any State other than the successor States of the SFRY (see paragraph 45 above).

The Court has held on many occasions that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła v.
