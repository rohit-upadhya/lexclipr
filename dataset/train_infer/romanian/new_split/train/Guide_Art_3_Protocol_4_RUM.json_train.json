                "After the decision of the Supreme Court, acting as an Admiralty Court, to repatriate the aliens, the Admiralty Marshal and the ship's captain informed the crew members that they would have to be repatriated. On 17 January 2003 the Admiralty Marshal and the ship's captain informed our office that the crew members were refusing to comply with the captain's instructions concerning their repatriation and were acting in a provocative manner. Fears were expressed that damage would be caused and/or that they would set fire to the ship. He requested understanding on the part of our service and help with their repatriation.",
                "Members of our office visited the ship and spoke to the members of the crew. They explained the reasons why they were to be repatriated and provided all possible help, but it became clear that the aliens did not intend to accept their repatriation.",
                "Taking into account the above and the captain's fears of damage being caused to the ship, and although our office tried to convince the aliens to accept voluntary repatriation, the conclusion was reached that the only option was to deport them on the basis of detention orders.",
                "When informed of all the details – the decision of the Admiralty Court on the one hand, and the unacceptable, provocative behaviour of the 15 crew members and their threats to the captain to set fire to the ship if any attempt to arrest and deport them was made, on the other – the Director of Immigration [ Director of the Civil Registry and Migration Department ] proceeded to issue orders for their arrest and detention. Following our explanations concerning the explosive situation the 15 crew members had created on the ship and their threats to set it alight, the lawyers'office representing them ..., [2] which was aware of the Admiralty Court's decision, secured tickets for their repatriation.",
                "On 18 February 2003, in complete cooperation with the captain and after giving serious consideration to his concerns, our office asked the 15 people concerned together with the other 6 crew members and the captain to attend our office at the port. Following our request the captain explained to the assembled group that they did not have any other choice but to comply and accept repatriation.",
                "I have to mention that, of the 15 crew members, 6 were women ... One of them was the wife of [Toomas Punt], Olena Lavrentian. Immediately after they had been informed by the captain of the Admiralty Court's decision, they were led to a room some distance away because it became apparent that the intentions of the ship's masseur Oleg Shchukin did not exclude causing an incident involving the captain or our members; infuriated, he had attacked our members and in our efforts to immobilise him injured police officers 847 and 1141.",
                "The five women were put in cars without being aware of the incident that had occurred, and left for the airport after first being taken to the ship to collect their personal belongings. Handcuffs were used for the 8 men; they were taken to the ship to collect their personal belongings and from there to the airport for their departure. At the airport, one of the men, Viktor Malyev, complained of chest pains and was transferred to Larnaca Hospital for tests and once it had been determined that he did not have anything was taken to the detention centre of the District Police Head Office until 22 February 2003, when he left for his country. He stated that he had done this to avoid being deported.",
                "Following a careful reading of your letter, it is observed that the allegations of the alien who was deported to a foreign country (Ukraine) have no basis since he was given sufficient time after receiving adequate explanations and chose to travel to Ukraine, where his wife comes from.",
                "His personal belongings, those of his wife and their baby and those of the rest of the crew who were deported, were collected by them when they were taken to the ship – first the group of women and then the men – once they had collected their personal belongings, they were taken to Larnaca Airport.",
                "The members of our service, following the activation of the detention and deportation orders, and after being faced with violent and aggressive behaviour by the masseur, subjected all the members of the crew to a body search and took away any personal objects that could possibly be used for causing damage to themselves, us or the service cars. Among the objects that were taken were the mobile phones some had in their possession. All the objects were returned when the members of the crew boarded the aircraft. ... the above - mentioned alien, claimed that he was not informed of the reasons for his detention and that the detention and deportation orders were not shown to him; these allegations are unfounded since the detention and deportation orders were shown to the crew members from a distance out of fear that they would be destroyed and the reasons for their deportation and arrest were explained to all of them by the Russian - speaking policemen ... from our unit whom they had injured and the captain. Their confinement to a detention room at Larnaca Airport was required as there was no other option in view of the violent and aggressive behaviour of the aliens.",
                "The confinement of the men and women in two different groups until they boarded the plane was considered necessary under the circumstances.”",

            ],
            [
                "51. Upon their arrival in Ukraine, the applicants lodged a petition with the Ukrainian Parliamentary Ombudsman ( Уповноважена Верховної Ради України з прав людини – the Ukrainian Ombudsman ) through the Ukrainian Marine Trade Unions Federation in which they complained of the degrading treatment they had received from the Cypriot authorities and a violation of their human rights."
            ],
            [
                "52. By a letter dated 19 March 2003 the Ukrainian Ombudsman referred the applicants'complaints to the Commissioner for Administration of the Republic of Cyprus (hereinafter “ the Cypriot Ombudsman”). The latter conducted an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the applicants'deportation. To that end, she requested the Ukrainian Ombudsman to forward written statements from the applicants; she also considered, inter alia, the submissions and documents sent by the immigration and police authorities ( including the documents referred to in paragraphs 47 and 50 above) and files from the Civil Registry and Migration Department, and met the applicants'lawyer.",
                "In her report of 8 November 2004 the Cypriot Ombudsman came to the following conclusions:",
                "(i) There were no legal grounds for the issuing of the deportation orders against the applicants. According to section 6(1)(k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law, an immigrant was considered a “prohibited immigrant” if he entered or resided in the Republic contrary to the above statute and the relevant Regulations (see paragraph 63 below). From the evidence before her it emerged that the applicants had never entered or resided in Cyprus illegally and that there had never been any report of a violation of the Aliens and Immigration Law or the Regulations. The applicants had been residing on a ship flying the Ukrainian flag and moored in Limassol Port, which suggested that for legal purposes they had been residing on Ukrainian territory. According to Regulation 29 (b) of the Alien and Immigration Regulations (see paragraph 63 below), ship crew members who remained in a port of the Republic were not considered as residing in the Republic. The fact that the applicants had been coming ashore on a daily basis after being granted a landing permit did not affect this. Given that for a deportation order to be issued, an alien had to be physically present in the country, the question that had to be asked was what were the true reasons behind the issue of the deportation orders against the applicants, bearing in mind that what had actually been sought was the departure of the applicants from the Ukrainian ship, not from Cyprus.",
                "(ii) Neither the captain's letter to the authorities nor the relevant police reports contained evidence to substantiate the allegations of disobedience on the part of the applicants vis-à-vis the local port authorities, the police or the law. The captain's letter described the crew's behaviour in a very general and broad manner. Although the possibility that the crew had committed disciplinary offences could not be excluded, there had been no mention of their having committed specific criminal offences which, under Cypriot law, would justify the involvement of the local authorities. Furthermore, in its decision of 23 December 2002, the Admiralty Court had not ordered the applicants'deportation but had merely required the food supplies to be stopped to all but four of the crew members, practical travel arrangements to be made for the applicants'repatriation and the relevant sums to be paid. The Admiralty Court's decision indicated that it had not excluded the possibility that the crew might not accept repatriation and had therefore ordered that their upkeep was to be terminated after 30 December 2002.",
                "(iii) The manner in which the deportation orders had been executed had violated the applicants'rights to access to information, to be heard and to seek court or out- of- court protection ( see, in particular section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law, and the Convention – paragraph 61 below ). The letters of 6 February 2002 concerning the deportation orders had not been served on the applicants and they had therefore been unaware until 18 February 2003 that their deportation was pending. The applicants had never been informed in writing of the decision of 5 February 2002 to deport them, in breach of section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law [ and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention ].",
                "(iv) Knowing that they had no right to board the vessel, the police had assembled the applicants at the immigration police office under the false pretence that photographs would be taken to enable their landing permits to be renewed. This had amounted to deception, given that from the moment the applicants were assembled they had been arrested and treated in a degrading manner as if they were common criminals. The Cypriot Ombudsman had no doubt that the applicants had not been allowed to contact their lawyer, their Embassy or any other person, despite their requests, and that it had been for this reason that their mobile phones had been taken away from them. She observed that it appeared that they had been immediately transferred to the airport in degrading conditions – especially for the men – having being handcuffed and placed in a vehicle with bars on the windows, in order to be returned to their own country, with only the clothes they were wearing.",
                "(v) The police had admitted using violence against the first applicant but had claimed that this had been justified, as he had reacted violently to his arrest, injuring two police officers. However, in view of the first applicant's absence abroad and the lack of a medical report concerning any injuries, the Cypriot Ombudsman stated that she had been unable to reach any objective or safe conclusion on whether the violence used against him had been necessary. In any event, she observed that what had taken place was wrong and that the decision to issue deportation orders which had no legal foundation had violated the applicants'fundamental rights to prior information, to be heard, to be treated with dignity, to be given time to collect their personal belongings, and to be deported to their native country or to a country of their choice (in the case of the tenth applicant only). It was for this reason that the applicants had reacted by resisting arrest and this had inevitably led to the use of violence by the police in order to arrest and deport them."
            ],
            [
                "53. Lastly, the Cypriot Ombudsman expressed reservations as to whether the applicants had been allowed to take their personal belongings and other documents from the ship prior to their deportation as the police had claimed. The fact that the applicants'arrest had taken place a few hours before the departure of the flight on which they were put led her to conclude that, with the exception of the fourth applicant, Mrs Punt, who had been permitted to take certain things for her child and personal documents, none of the members of the crew had been allowed to take any of their personal belongings with them."
            ],
            [
                "54. In accordance with the Commissioner for Administration Law of 1991 (Law 3/1991 as amended), the Cypriot Ombudsman decided to refer the applicants'case to the Attorney-General, whom she requested to examine the possibility of taking legal action. She indicated in this connection that she had no power to grant compensation for any damage incurred as a result of maladministration, as this came solely within the jurisdiction of the courts."

                "In her statement the fourth applicant claimed that she had been taken to the ship by the authorities to collect her marriage certificate. The authorities had taken all her documents (her Ukrainian passports, her daughter's birth certificate and her marriage certificate) but had refused to allow her to take things for her and her baby ( such as a medical card, nappies, baby food and toys). She was only allowed to take milk for the baby. Her documents had been returned to her on the aircraft.",

One of them silently gripped my arms, but I had time to get it free, then the other grabbed my throat staying behind me, and the first hit me in the head. I tried to fence my head against blows, but there were many people in civilian [ sic ]; they did not introduce themselves, nor did they show the documents.

He had been forced to lie down on the floor throughout the journey as one of the persons in civilian clothes had his knee on his chest to keep him down. His head ached because of the blows, his face was swollen and he could not see out of one of his eyes. No reference was made in the statement to the medical examination the first applicant had undergone in Ukraine or to the medical report drawn up following that examination.",

The rest of the sailors, more than 65, who remained on the ship, refused to work on it and, taking advantage of the authorities'patience, disembarked : the men, who were employed illegally in town ... every morning, and the women, who engaged in various unlawful acts, including prostitution, at night. Essentially, the ship was used by the majority of the crew as a hotel and restaurant.",

All the illegal activities of the crew, such as acts of violence, theft of items from the ship, unlawful employment of the sailors off the ship were covered up by the ship's captain Mr V.

Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 85, Reports 1998-VIII).

Turkey, no. 56003/00, § 82, 31 July 2007). The Court also points out that a civil court is itself unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of assaults, still less of attributing responsibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, § 74, Reports 1998-VI, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00, §§ 119-21, 24 February 2005)."

This is particularly so in view of the circumstances in which the deportation operation was carried out and the admission by the police in their reports that they had used force in order to effect the first applicant's arrest.

It is common ground that the police officers used force against the first applicant during his arrest. The Government submitted that the officers had had to resort to force as a result of the first applicant's violent behaviour. In particular, they noted that he had become infuriated and had attacked the officers. In their attempt to immobilise him, two of the officers had been injured. One of them had suffered a bruise and blood contusion on his right ankle.

The Government have not disputed that the applicant's injuries, as shown by the medical report of 21 February 2003, were caused by the force used by the police officers. From this report it appears that the first applicant suffered a head injury and ecchymosis, neck ecchymoses and abrasions in the area of the wrist joints. In his statement of 2 June 2003 to the Cypriot Ombudsman the first applicant maintained that the police officers had reacted violently when he had asked the reasons for the detention and deportation of all the applicants but admitted that, when they had tried to handcuff him, he had managed to free his arms.

Furthermore, the abrasions in the area of the wrist joints could have been caused by the handcuffs which the authorities used. The descriptions given, in particular, in the statements of the third, and to a certain extent, the ninth applicants, corroborate that of the first applicant.

The Court considers that, taken together, the first applicant's complaint to the Cypriot Ombudsman concerning the use of police violence during his arrest at the immigration police offices, the reference in his statement to the injuries sustained and the admission by the police that force had been used gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that he might have been subjected to ill-treatment by the police.

The Government relied on the case of Andreas Tsouloupa v. The Attorney-General of the Republic (see paragraph 68 above). The Government also noted that in such an action the applicants could have joined a claim for assault."

                "113. As to the merits, the Government submitted that the applicants had been arrested and detained for the purpose of effecting their deportation and that, therefore, their deprivation of liberty had been permissible under the Convention. The Government relied on the Court's judgment in the case of Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, § 112, Reports 1996 ‑ V). The applicants'arrest and detention had been based on and in conformity with domestic law and procedure and there had been no arbitrariness in the exercise by the authorities of their powers of arrest. The applicant's landing permits had been revoked from the moment they had been asked by the immigration authorities to leave the Republic. At that point they had become prohibited immigrants under the Aliens and Immigration Law. Consequently, the immigration authorities had been entitled to proceed with the execution of the detention and deportation orders against them in accordance with section 14 of the Law. In the alternative, the Government claimed that as the applicants'conduct had posed a risk to public order and safety, the immigration authorities had had the right to execute the orders under section 10 of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see paragraph 62 above) irrespective of whether they were prohibited immigrants or not. Furthermore, in compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 2 of the Convention, the applicants had been informed of the reasons for their arrest and deportation from the outset, both by the Ukrainian captain of the ship and by a Russian-speaking member of the immigration police."

Even assuming that the applicants were right that the reason given to them for their attendance at the immigration offices had been to enable photographs to be taken for the renewal of their landing permits, in the Government's opinion it had been legitimate in the circumstances to use a stratagem in order to ensure that the applicants were assembled in one place in the Republic on the day their flights were scheduled so that they could be requested to leave. In the event of a refusal the deportation orders could then have been executed. If the authorities had requested the applicants to leave when they were still on board the ship, they would not have been able, in the event of a refusal, to arrest them or to proceed with the execution of the deportation orders. Criminal liability did not extend to offences committed by aliens on a vessel flying a foreign flag unless the offences fell within the ambit of section 5 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 7 3 above). In connection with the above the Government stressed that the applicants, unlike the applicants in the case of Čonka v. Belgium (no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), had no place of abode and/or work in the Republic. They also emphasised that this had not been an ordinary case of aliens residing and/or working in a State's territory where different possibilities existed for arresting and deporting those not lawfully resident. Calling the applicants to attend the immigration police offices at the harbour had been the only option left to the authorities to secure their deportation. It was not a course of action that had been used merely to facilitate their deportation or make it more effective."

Since the ship had been flying the Ukrainian flag, the Cypriot authorities had not had the power to make or execute a deportation order. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the applicants had represented a danger to public order. In that connection, they pointed out that they had not been accused at any time of breaching public order and there had been no evidence that they had disobeyed the captain.

Once this burden of proof is satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68)."

The applicants were then invited to attend the immigration police offices at Limassol Port on 18 February 2003 so that photographs could be taken for the renewal of their landing permits, which were due to expire at the end of the month. However, this was only a stratagem. The applicants'account is, in the Court's opinion, plausible in the absence of any evidence or explanation to the contrary and in the light of the Cypriot Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter. Air tickets were purchased by the lawyer who was representing other crew members in the proceedings before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 21 above) and the applicants were booked on a flight on 18 February 2003.

The orders were printed in the Greek language and shown only from a distance. No information was given to the applicants about the remedies available to contest their detention and deportation and they were not allowed to contact a lawyer and/or their respective embassies. In this connection, it is noted that the authorities took the applicants'mobile phones away and only returned them when the applicants were aboard the plane.

As regards the accessibility of a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, this implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy in question (see Čonka, cited above, § 46). However, this was not the position in the present case since, during their detention and before their deportation, the applicants were not afforded any such possibility."

                "127. Notwithstanding the above, and to the extent that the Government can be understood to be arguing that the applicants should have had recourse to the alleged remedies after their deportation, the Court observes the following. It appears from the material submitted to the Court that the applicants had a lawyer in Cyprus (see paragraphs 9 and 52 above). Furthermore, certain of the applicants had proceedings pending before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 9 above). The Court considers, therefore, that it was feasible for the applicants, once in their respective countries, [3] to bring their complaints before the Cypriot courts. The Court cannot accept the applicants'claim that they were denied this possibility because they were not allowed to enter Cyprus. The Court reiterates that the object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address the allegation made of violation of a Convention right and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. The Court points out in this connection that applicants have been required to exhaust domestic remedies even where they are not within the jurisdiction of the respondent State ( see for example, Abbasi v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 21713/06, 5 July 2007, and Ostojić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 16837/02, 26 September 2002). The Court further notes that the applicants have not put forward any arguments casting doubt on the effectiveness or adequacy of the remedies proposed by the Government. Finally, the Court observes that an examination of the case, such as it has been submitted, does not disclose the existence of any circumstances which might have absolved the applicants from availing themselves of these remedies."

In addition, taking into consideration the baby's age at the time, the Ukrainian Government contended that warm clothes had not been the only items necessary for the trip. In view of the fact that the applicants had been invited to the immigration office to enable photographs to be taken so that new landing permits could be issued and had not expected to be deported on that date, it was doubtful that there had been sufficient time between the arrest and the deportation for the fourth applicant to collect everything she needed for her baby."

The Court finds, therefore, that the evidence before it does not allow it to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the fourth applicant was not able to take any warm clothing or any other covering for her baby. Further, it has not been shown that it was not possible to secure such clothing or covering on board the aircraft prior to disembarkation. With regard to the adult applicants, it would indeed appear, in view of the Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter, that they were deported in the clothes they were wearing at the time of their arrest. Assuming therefore that the applicants did not have sufficiently warm clothing when deported, there is no indication of any intention to humiliate or debase them; rather, this situation was due to the hastiness of the deportation.

The application of this principle has been found to extend equally to the relationship between natural fathers and their children born out of wedlock. Further, the Court considers that Article 8 cannot be interpreted as only protecting “family life” which has already been established but, where the circumstances warrant it, must extend to the potential relationship which may develop between a natural father and a child born out of wedlock. Relevant factors in this regard include the nature of the relationship between the natural parents and the demonstrable interest in and commitment by the natural father to the child both before and after the birth (see Nylund v.

The Court finds that, in these circumstances, the denial of citizenship cannot be said to have acted as an impediment to establishing family life or otherwise to have had an impact on the applicant’s right to respect for family life. However, as the Court has observed above, even in the absence of family life, the denial of citizenship may raise an issue under Article 8 because of its impact on the private life of an individual, which concept is wide enough to embrace aspects of a person’s social identity.

The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify different treatment in law; the scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background (see, Inze, cited above, § 41)."

                "44. The Court reiterates that the Convention must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see, inter alia, E.B v. France., cited above, § 92). The question of equality between children born in and children born out of wedlock was, at the time of the Inze judgment (cited above) in 1987, already given importance in the member States of the Council of Europe. This was shown by the 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock, which at the time was in force in nine member States of the Council of Europe. Today, twenty-three years later, this Convention is in force in twenty-two member states. Thus, it is clear that the domestic law of the member States of the Council of Europe has evolved and is continuing to evolve, in company with the relevant international instruments on the subject. The Court further observes that in searching for common ground among the norms of international law it has never distinguished between sources of law according to whether or not they have been signed or ratified by the respondent State (see Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 78, 12 November 2008). Thus, in the case of Marckx v. Belgium (cited above) concerning the legal status of children born out of wedlock, the Court based its interpretation on two international conventions of 1962 and 1975 that Belgium, like other States Parties to the Convention, had not yet ratified at the time (§§ 20 and 41). Against this background, even though Malta has not ratified the 1975 European Convention, the Court reaffirms that very weighty reasons would have to be advanced before what appears to be an arbitrary difference in treatment on the ground of birth out of wedlock could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Inze, cited above, § 41)."

However, it is precisely a distinction based on such a link which Article 14 of the Convention protects against. The status of an illegitimate child derives from the fact that his or her parents were not married at the time of their child’s birth. It is therefore a distinction based on such a status which the Convention prohibits, unless it is otherwise objectively justified."

The stamping of her passport by the airport and border police was merely an administrative formality recording that the applicant had arrived at the frontier and that it had been checked that her papers were in order. This check did not preclude the High Commissioner from exercising the special powers he held in virtue of the territory ’ s legal status or the ordinary police powers, inherent in his office, for keeping public order. The applicant had accordingly never been legally authorised by the administrative authorities to enter the territory.

In this instance Mrs Piermont was stopped just after her passport had been stamped and the impugned order was served on her before she had left the airport, since she was still held in an office under police guard.",

The impugned speech went with the tide of history, seeing that the French Government had suspended nuclear tests in the region in 1992 and, under the Matignon agreements, had recognised the right of the Caledonian people to self-determination through a referendum. The applicant had merely taken part in a democratic debate initiated locally by elected representatives of the people, whom she met in her capacity as a European elected representative. It was a case in which the requirements of the upholding of public order had to be weighed against the interests of \"free discussion of political issues\". At all events, the measure taken could not be justified by a threat to public order in the sense in which the term was used in both national and Community case-law. Lastly, the freedom guaranteed in Article 10 (art. 10) applied regardless of frontiers, and alternative legal means existed for punishing the conduct complained of, such as criminal proceedings for defamation."

Nevertheless, the values she embodied should prompt her to express herself in a manner consistent with those very values. Since freedom of expression also entailed duties, the tense local political atmosphere and the imminence of two sets of elections called for some caution on Mrs Piermont ’ s part, particularly when she intended to speak in her capacity as an MEP. She had, however, made vehement utterances calling in question the legal order of the French Republic and the institutions of Polynesia.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to \"information\" or \"ideas\" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \"democratic society\" (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 22, para. 42). A person opposed to official ideas and positions must be able to find a place in the political arena. \"While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people ... Accordingly, interferences with [his] freedom of expression ... call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court\" (ibid., pp. 22-23, para. 42).",

Furthermore, she was requested on her arrival to show some discretion in what she said in public.",

At no time did the MEP call for violence or disorder; she spoke in support of the anti-nuclear and independence demands made by several local parties. Her speech was therefore a contribution to a democratic debate in Polynesia. Moreover, the demonstration was not followed by any disorder and the Government did not show that the stances taken up by the applicant caused any unrest in Polynesia. According to the Papeete Administrative Court, her utterances were \"not in any way seditious and could not in themselves constitute a serious threat to public order\". Furthermore, although the expulsion order was served just before the applicant ’ s departure, it was made the day after the demonstration in issue.

Movable and immovable property belonging to independence campaigners had been destroyed and this had led to reprisals in the form of arson attacks and stone-throwing. The announcement of Mrs Piermont ’ s arrival in Nouméa had contributed to heightening this tension, as was shown by the incidents at the airport.

The applicants had been residing on a ship flying the Ukrainian flag and moored in Limassol Port, which suggested that for legal purposes they had been residing on Ukrainian territory. According to Regulation 29 (b) of the Alien and Immigration Regulations (see paragraph 63 below), ship crew members who remained in a port of the Republic were not considered as residing in the Republic.

Given that for a deportation order to be issued, an alien had to be physically present in the country, the question that had to be asked was what were the true reasons behind the issue of the deportation orders against the applicants, bearing in mind that what had actually been sought was the departure of the applicants from the Ukrainian ship, not from Cyprus.",
                "(ii) Neither the captain's letter to the authorities nor the relevant police reports contained evidence to substantiate the allegations of disobedience on the part of the applicants vis-à-vis the local port authorities, the police or the law. The captain's letter described the crew's behaviour in a very general and broad manner. Although the possibility that the crew had committed disciplinary offences could not be excluded, there had been no mention of their having committed specific criminal offences which, under Cypriot law, would justify the involvement of the local authorities. Furthermore, in its decision of 23 December 2002, the Admiralty Court had not ordered the applicants'deportation but had merely required the food supplies to be stopped to all but four of the crew members, practical travel arrangements to be made for the applicants'repatriation and the relevant sums to be paid. The Admiralty Court's decision indicated that it had not excluded the possibility that the crew might not accept repatriation and had therefore ordered that their upkeep was to be terminated after 30 December 2002.",
                "(iii) The manner in which the deportation orders had been executed had violated the applicants'rights to access to information, to be heard and to seek court or out- of- court protection ( see, in particular section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law, and the Convention – paragraph 61 below ). The letters of 6 February 2002 concerning the deportation orders had not been served on the applicants and they had therefore been unaware until 18 February 2003 that their deportation was pending. The applicants had never been informed in writing of the decision of 5 February 2002 to deport them, in breach of section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law [ and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention ].",
                "(iv) Knowing that they had no right to board the vessel, the police had assembled the applicants at the immigration police office under the false pretence that photographs would be taken to enable their landing permits to be renewed. This had amounted to deception, given that from the moment the applicants were assembled they had been arrested and treated in a degrading manner as if they were common criminals. The Cypriot Ombudsman had no doubt that the applicants had not been allowed to contact their lawyer, their Embassy or any other person, despite their requests, and that it had been for this reason that their mobile phones had been taken away from them. She observed that it appeared that they had been immediately transferred to the airport in degrading conditions – especially for the men – having being handcuffed and placed in a vehicle with bars on the windows, in order to be returned to their own country, with only the clothes they were wearing.",
                "(v) The police had admitted using violence against the first applicant but had claimed that this had been justified, as he had reacted violently to his arrest, injuring two police officers. However, in view of the first applicant's absence abroad and the lack of a medical report concerning any injuries, the Cypriot Ombudsman stated that she had been unable to reach any objective or safe conclusion on whether the violence used against him had been necessary. In any event, she observed that what had taken place was wrong and that the decision to issue deportation orders which had no legal foundation had violated the applicants'fundamental rights to prior information, to be heard, to be treated with dignity, to be given time to collect their personal belongings, and to be deported to their native country or to a country of their choice (in the case of the tenth applicant only). It was for this reason that the applicants had reacted by resisting arrest and this had inevitably led to the use of violence by the police in order to arrest and deport them."

                "53. Lastly, the Cypriot Ombudsman expressed reservations as to whether the applicants had been allowed to take their personal belongings and other documents from the ship prior to their deportation as the police had claimed. The fact that the applicants'arrest had taken place a few hours before the departure of the flight on which they were put led her to conclude that, with the exception of the fourth applicant, Mrs Punt, who had been permitted to take certain things for her child and personal documents, none of the members of the crew had been allowed to take any of their personal belongings with them."

However, although Article 35 § 1 requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, it does not require that recourse should be had to remedies that are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, §§ 51-52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, cited above, §§ 65-67, Reports 1996-IV )."

Turning to the present case, the Court firstly points out, with regard to the civil remedy of assault put forward by the Government, that, as it has already found in a number of cases, a civil action, which is aimed at awarding damages, cannot by itself be regarded as an effective remedy in the context of claims brought under Article 3 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 85, Reports 1998-VIII). The notion of an “effective remedy” under this provision entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, among many other authorities, Aşan and Others v. Turkey, no. 56003/00, § 82, 31 July 2007). The Court also points out that a civil court is itself unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of assaults, still less of attributing responsibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, § 74, Reports 1998-VI, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00, §§ 119-21, 24 February 2005)."

It appears that there was no follow-up to her report by the Attorney General's office.

This is particularly so in view of the circumstances in which the deportation operation was carried out and the admission by the police in their reports that they had used force in order to effect the first applicant's arrest.

It is common ground that the police officers used force against the first applicant during his arrest. The Government submitted that the officers had had to resort to force as a result of the first applicant's violent behaviour. In particular, they noted that he had become infuriated and had attacked the officers. In their attempt to immobilise him, two of the officers had been injured. One of them had suffered a bruise and blood contusion on his right ankle. He had been transferred to hospital for treatment and granted five days'sick leave (see reports of 19 February and 16 April 2003, quoted in paragraphs 47 and 50 above). The Government have not disputed that the applicant's injuries, as shown by the medical report of 21 February 2003, were caused by the force used by the police officers. From this report it appears that the first applicant suffered a head injury and ecchymosis, neck ecchymoses and abrasions in the area of the wrist joints. In his statement of 2 June 2003 to the Cypriot Ombudsman the first applicant maintained that the police officers had reacted violently when he had asked the reasons for the detention and deportation of all the applicants but admitted that, when they had tried to handcuff him, he had managed to free his arms.

Furthermore, the abrasions in the area of the wrist joints could have been caused by the handcuffs which the authorities used. The descriptions given, in particular, in the statements of the third, and to a certain extent, the ninth applicants, corroborate that of the first applicant.

The Court considers that, taken together, the first applicant's complaint to the Cypriot Ombudsman concerning the use of police violence during his arrest at the immigration police offices, the reference in his statement to the injuries sustained and the admission by the police that force had been used gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that he might have been subjected to ill-treatment by the police.

The applicants'arrest and detention had been based on and in conformity with domestic law and procedure and there had been no arbitrariness in the exercise by the authorities of their powers of arrest. The applicant's landing permits had been revoked from the moment they had been asked by the immigration authorities to leave the Republic. At that point they had become prohibited immigrants under the Aliens and Immigration Law. Consequently, the immigration authorities had been entitled to proceed with the execution of the detention and deportation orders against them in accordance with section 14 of the Law. In the alternative, the Government claimed that as the applicants'conduct had posed a risk to public order and safety, the immigration authorities had had the right to execute the orders under section 10 of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see paragraph 62 above) irrespective of whether they were prohibited immigrants or not. Furthermore, in compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 2 of the Convention, the applicants had been informed of the reasons for their arrest and deportation from the outset, both by the Ukrainian captain of the ship and by a Russian-speaking member of the immigration police."

In the event of a refusal the deportation orders could then have been executed. If the authorities had requested the applicants to leave when they were still on board the ship, they would not have been able, in the event of a refusal, to arrest them or to proceed with the execution of the deportation orders. Criminal liability did not extend to offences committed by aliens on a vessel flying a foreign flag unless the offences fell within the ambit of section 5 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 7 3 above). In connection with the above the Government stressed that the applicants, unlike the applicants in the case of Čonka v. Belgium (no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), had no place of abode and/or work in the Republic.

Once this burden of proof is satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68)."

In the absence of any evidence or explanation to the contrary by the Government, the Court finds that the applicants were not given notice of the detention and deportation orders when they were issued. The applicants were then invited to attend the immigration police offices at Limassol Port on 18 February 2003 so that photographs could be taken for the renewal of their landing permits, which were due to expire at the end of the month. However, this was only a stratagem. The applicants'account is, in the Court's opinion, plausible in the absence of any evidence or explanation to the contrary and in the light of the Cypriot Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter. Air tickets were purchased by the lawyer who was representing other crew members in the proceedings before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 21 above) and the applicants were booked on a flight on 18 February 2003. It does not appear that the applicants were aware that these tickets had been issued."

According to the Government, the applicants were informed of and shown the orders at the immigration police offices at Limassol Port at the last moment, when the orders were actually being enforced (see paragraph 41 above). The orders were printed in the Greek language and shown only from a distance. No information was given to the applicants about the remedies available to contest their detention and deportation and they were not allowed to contact a lawyer and/or their respective embassies. In this connection, it is noted that the authorities took the applicants'mobile phones away and only returned them when the applicants were aboard the plane. Furthermore, the authorities did not offer any form of legal assistance to the applicants at the immigration police offices."

As regards the accessibility of a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, this implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy in question (see Čonka, cited above, § 46). However, this was not the position in the present case since, during their detention and before their deportation, the applicants were not afforded any such possibility."

                "127. Notwithstanding the above, and to the extent that the Government can be understood to be arguing that the applicants should have had recourse to the alleged remedies after their deportation, the Court observes the following. It appears from the material submitted to the Court that the applicants had a lawyer in Cyprus (see paragraphs 9 and 52 above). Furthermore, certain of the applicants had proceedings pending before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 9 above). The Court considers, therefore, that it was feasible for the applicants, once in their respective countries, [3] to bring their complaints before the Cypriot courts. The Court cannot accept the applicants'claim that they were denied this possibility because they were not allowed to enter Cyprus. The Court reiterates that the object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address the allegation made of violation of a Convention right and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. The Court points out in this connection that applicants have been required to exhaust domestic remedies even where they are not within the jurisdiction of the respondent State ( see for example, Abbasi v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 21713/06, 5 July 2007, and Ostojić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 16837/02, 26 September 2002). The Court further notes that the applicants have not put forward any arguments casting doubt on the effectiveness or adequacy of the remedies proposed by the Government. Finally, the Court observes that an examination of the case, such as it has been submitted, does not disclose the existence of any circumstances which might have absolved the applicants from availing themselves of these remedies."

Furthermore, the fourth applicant had not complained to the Cypriot Ombudsman that her request to take warm clothes for her baby had been refused.

In addition, taking into consideration the baby's age at the time, the Ukrainian Government contended that warm clothes had not been the only items necessary for the trip. In view of the fact that the applicants had been invited to the immigration office to enable photographs to be taken so that new landing permits could be issued and had not expected to be deported on that date, it was doubtful that there had been sufficient time between the arrest and the deportation for the fourth applicant to collect everything she needed for her baby."

With regard to the eleventh applicant, the baby, the Cypriot Ombudsman observed in general terms that her mother, the fourth applicant, had been allowed to go to the vessel to collect some things for her (see paragraph 53 above). The Court finds, therefore, that the evidence before it does not allow it to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the fourth applicant was not able to take any warm clothing or any other covering for her baby. Further, it has not been shown that it was not possible to secure such clothing or covering on board the aircraft prior to disembarkation. With regard to the adult applicants, it would indeed appear, in view of the Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter, that they were deported in the clothes they were wearing at the time of their arrest. Assuming therefore that the applicants did not have sufficiently warm clothing when deported, there is no indication of any intention to humiliate or debase them; rather, this situation was due to the hastiness of the deportation.
