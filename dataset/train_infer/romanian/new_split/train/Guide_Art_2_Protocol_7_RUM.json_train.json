According to this procedure, the prosecutor could lodge an extraordinary appeal ( protest ) against the court decision.

The Court recalls that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in determining how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. In certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on that right of review must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 96, ECHR 2001 ‑ II ). The Court also recalls that, to be effective, a remedy must be independent of any discretionary action by the authorities and must be directly available to those concerned (see Kucherenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999 )."

It could only be initiated by a prosecutor or by a motion of the president of the higher court (see paragraphs 30-32 above ). Given that this procedure was not directly accessible to a party to the proceedings and did not depend on his or her motion and arguments, the Court considers that it was not a sufficiently effective remedy for Convention purposes."

As to the Government's argument that the decision ordering the applicant's administrative arrest and detention was actually reviewed by a higher court, the Court finds no evidence that the extraordinary appeal lodged by the Prosecutor's Office was initiated upon the applicant's own motion. Moreover, this appeal reflected the position of the Prosecutor's Office, and not of the applicant. During these proceedings the applicant was not given an opportunity to present any arguments, and the issue under consideration was the dispute between the Prosecutor's Office and the court over the competence to impose a sanction on the applicant. The Court considers that the mere fact that the review initiated by the Prosecutor's Office had some positive, albeit temporary, impact on the applicant's situation, namely the suspension of his sentence, was not in itself sufficient to conclude that the extraordinary appeal was an effective remedy which could have satisfied the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7."

The Court has held that delays by the national courts in examining appeals against decrees on a special prison regime applicable for a limited period time may raise issues under the Convention, in particular, its Article 13. Thus, in Messina v. Italy (no. 2) the Court, while acknowledging that the right to an effective remedy was not infringed merely by a failure to comply with a statutory time-limit, concluded that the systematic failure to comply with the ten-day time-limit imposed on the courts was liable to considerably reduce, and indeed practically nullify, the impact of judicial review of the decrees on a special regime. One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, §§ 94 ‑ 96, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; see also Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, §§ 73 and 74, ECHR 2009). In other words, a judicial review of a measure, which had by that time expired or almost expired, was considered to serve no longer any purpose."

This was done pursuant to the Code of Administrative Offences providing for the immediate enforcement of a sentence only if it concerned deprivation of liberty (with another unrelated exception – see paragraph 16 above). Had the sanction been different, the first-instance court ’ s decision would have become enforceable only in the absence of an appeal within the legally envisaged time-limits or once upheld by the appellate court. In the present case, however, the appellate review took place after the detention sentence imposed on the applicant by the first-instance court had been served in full. The Court finds it inconceivable how that review would have been able to effectively cure the defects of the lower court ’ s decision at that stage."

According to the Court ’ s well-established case-law, freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of Article 10, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those which offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society”. Moreover, Article 10 of the Convention protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, among many other authorities, Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, § 57, Series A no. 204, and Women On Waves and Others v. Portugal, no. 31276/05, §§ 29 and 30, 3 February 2009)."

The provision in question concerns, in particular, offensive behaviour disturbing public order (see paragraph 16 above). In the Court ’ s opinion, damaging the wreath ribbon by the applicant could be regarded as falling under the aforementioned category. The Court is mindful of the quite general legal definition of “petty hooliganism”, the interpretation and practical implementation of which might be open to abuse in certain cases. In the present case, however, the applicant resorted to a provocative gesture likely to disturb or insult some of the many people who witnessed it. Having regard to the applicant ’ s behaviour and to its classification by the domestic courts, the Court accepts that the applicable national legislation met the foreseeability requirement.

In doing so, the court referred to the applicant ’ s refusal to admit her guilt, thus penalising her reluctance to change her political views.

Furthermore, it is considered acceptable that, in certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach, cited above, § 96; Gurepka v.

Thus, in Messina v. Italy (no. 2) the Court, while acknowledging that the right to an effective remedy was not infringed merely by a failure to comply with a statutory time-limit, concluded that the systematic failure to comply with the ten-day time-limit imposed on the courts was liable to considerably reduce, and indeed practically nullify, the impact of judicial review of the decrees on a special regime. One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, §§ 94 ‑ 96, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; see also Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, §§ 73 and 74, ECHR 2009). In other words, a judicial review of a measure, which had by that time expired or almost expired, was considered to serve no longer any purpose."

This was done pursuant to the Code of Administrative Offences providing for the immediate enforcement of a sentence only if it concerned deprivation of liberty (with another unrelated exception – see paragraph 16 above). Had the sanction been different, the first-instance court ’ s decision would have become enforceable only in the absence of an appeal within the legally envisaged time-limits or once upheld by the appellate court. In the present case, however, the appellate review took place after the detention sentence imposed on the applicant by the first-instance court had been served in full.

Although this type of crime was punishable with five to eight years ’ imprisonment, the court considered it possible to apply a more lenient sanction to the applicant. It had regard, in particular, to the fact that he had pleaded guilty and had shown remorse. Accordingly, the Bila Tserkva Court sentenced the applicant to four years and seven months ’ imprisonment. It also decided to include in the served part of the applicant ’ s sentence the period from 20 October 2005 to 3 May 2006 (six months and fourteen days), during which he had been detained in the context of another criminal case. Lastly, in fixing the applicant ’ s sentence the court had regard to the fact that he “had spent more than four years in [pre-trial] detention facilities in which the detention conditions were considerably harsher than in a post-conviction prison, and the previous judgments in respect of him had been quashed”.

The Court notes that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity, that the domestic legal system provides an effective remedy which can deal with the substance of an arguable complaint under the Convention and grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 93, 10 January 2012, with further references)."

The existence of these remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court on these points, that is to say, that the remedy to which they refer was accessible and capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints, and offered a reasonable prospect of success. However, once the question of this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to applicants to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in their case, or that there existed special circumstances exempting them from the requirement to have recourse to it (see, for example, Melnik v.

At that stage he had no possibility of bringing judicial proceedings, by which the lawfulness of his continued detention thereafter would have been decided speedily and his release would have been ordered. Thus, the case was no longer before the first-instance court. As to an ordinary appeal, its examination would have been likely to last longer than the detention of which the applicant complained (twelve days). Moreover, it is not improbable that lodging an appeal would have entailed further extension of his detention as a preventive measure until the judgment became final.

The Court notes, however, that that provision is worded in quite general terms: it neither establishes legal preconditions for claiming compensation nor provides for specific mechanisms or procedures. Instead, Article 1176 refers to a separate law regulating those issues. It appears that it is the special law on compensation which should be applicable (see paragraphs 23 ­ 24 above). The Government did not refer to that law in their observations. Nor did they specify which provision of the domestic law the applicant ’ s detention had in fact violated. The Government also failed to cite any relevant domestic case-law in this regard.

Germany, 27 June 1968, p. 23, § 9, Series A no. 7 ). Furthermore, a person convicted at first instance and detained pending appeal cannot be considered to be detained for the purpose of bringing him or her before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence under Article 5 § 1 (c) (see, in particular, Solmaz v.

Austria, 2 8 March 1990, § 39, Series A no. 175, and Solmaz, cited above, § 26 ).

Although the penalty imposed was to expire three days later, the second measure was to last for at least twelve days longer, given the fifteen - day time-limit for lodging appeals.

The Court reiterates that any deprivation of liberty must, in addition to falling within one of the exceptions set out in sub -paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 § 1, be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see, among many other authorities, Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI, and Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 50, ECHR 2000 ‑ III )."

                "58. In assessing whether detention is lawful, the Court must also ascertain whether the domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness. The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the domestic law define clearly the conditions for detention (see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 125, with further references)."

            [
                "59. Furthermore, arbitrary detention cannot be compatible with Article 5 § 1, as the notion of “arbitrariness” in this context extends beyond the lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty that is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 77, 9 July 2009)."
            ],

                "60. The Court has not previously formulated a general definition of what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1. However, key principles that have been developed on a case-by-case basis demonstrate that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 68, ECHR 2008, and Plesó v. Hungary, no. 41242/08, § 57, 2 October 2012). One general principle established in the Court ’ s case-law is that detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities or where the domestic authorities neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Mooren, cited above, § 78 )."
            ],
            [
                "61. Furthermore, the requirement that detention must not be arbitrary implies the need for a relationship of proportionality between the ground of detention relied upon and the detention in question (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, § 195). The scope of the proportionality test to be applied in a given case varies depending on the type of detention involved. In the context of detention pursuant to Article 5 § 1 (a), the Court has generally been satisfied that the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for this Court (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 103, 16 December 1999, and Saadi, cited above, § 71). At the same time, in assessing whether there were indications of arbitrariness in the applicants ’ preventive detention not constituting a part of the sentence but still falling under Article 5 § 1 (a), the Court has found it necessary to identify the purpose of their detention under Article 5 § 1 (a) and has pursued the proportionality test (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, § 205).",

Furthermore, the applicable legal provisions appear clear and foreseeable in their application. Thus, the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine explicitly states that the sentencing court must decide which preventive measure should be applied to the convicted person until the judgment becomes final (see paragraph 18 above).

However, no such considerations were mentioned in, or can be inferred from, the judgment of the Bila Tserkva Court of 12 July 2010.

The Court reiterates that some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable, and often inevitable, in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities.

Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, § 82, 30 January 2003). It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivations of liberty (see, for example, Shukhardin v.

In this connection, the Government referred to the case - law of the HSC (see paragraph 17 above). For the Government, the procedure established by Article 349 § 3 of the CCP allowed defendants to validly waive their procedural rights. Moreover, it complied with the requirements for a valid waiver set forth in the Court ’ s case-law, in that it required the domestic courts to verify that defendants understood the implications of accepting the use of that abridged procedure and accepted it voluntarily. Moreover, the waiver under Article 349 § 3 was not absolute in that it did not prevent appeals on procedural grounds and did not extend to the legal classification of the admitted facts. In that sense, the scope of the notion of “circumstances” used in the provision in question was precise and foreseeable. Accordingly, the applicant had not been deprived of the right to appeal against his conviction. His appeal had been dismissed apparently because the domestic courts had considered that, despite his apparent wish to challenge the legal classification of the offence, he “ in fact challenged his admittance [sic] of the facts under Article 349 § 3 procedure”. The Government considered that there had therefore been no violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7."

The Court likewise perceives nothing in the text of the applicant ’ s appeal which would support this reading.

In that connection the Court points out that any applicant must have provided the domestic courts with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States, namely the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach. The only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see Mifsud v.

There is nothing in the materials submitted by the Government to allow the Court to consider this letter to be a judicial decision against which an appeal was possible.

Thus, the review by a higher court of a conviction or sentence may concern both points of fact and points of law, or be confined solely to points of law. Furthermore, in certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach v.

As a general rule, it is possible to lodge an appeal against a conviction within ten days of the delivery of the judgment by the court at first level of jurisdiction. Furthermore, once the ten-day limit has passed and the judgment has become final, the defendant may either present him- or herself physically before the competent court asking for his conviction to be quashed, by way of cassation appeal, and a retrial, or ask for reinstatement of the time-limit for appeal should he or she consider such reinstatement justified.

Judge Z.M. went on to criticise the applicants for abusing their right to freedom of expression. He found it established from the case materials that the applicants had truly exhibited “manifest and gross contempt” towards the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by committing those acts “inside the court building, namely in its central entrance hall”. In any event, the aim of Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP was, in the opinion of Judge Z.M., to protect public order not only inside court - houses but also outside them, in adjacent premises. The President of the Court of Appeal had no other choice but to sanction the applicants under Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, since what was at stake in the given situation was “not the judge ’ s own interests but the authority of the court and the proper administration of justice”. In reply to the complaint that the President of the Court of Appeal had made her decision entirely on the basis of one-sided submissions, Judge Z.M. stated that all the evidence – the records of the applicants ’ arrest and the explanatory notes – had been drafted and submitted by the bailiffs for consideration by the President in accordance with a procedure envisaged by law.

Indeed, noting that the applicants ’ various complaints are based on their arrest and detention, which they had duly contested before the competent domestic court as unlawful, the Court dismisses the Government ’ s objection of non-exhaustion (compare also with Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, §§ 48-50 and 93, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

Notably, they were arrested on suspicion of a breach of public order and contempt of court, which actions constituted “ offences ” within the meaning of that particular provision. As to the domestic legal basis for the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty, the Government referred to section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act and Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, which entitled a competent judicial authority to punish offenders by the imposition of detention (see paragraphs 2 8 and 30 above). Alternatively, the Government suggested that the applicants ’ arrest and detention could also be considered to fall under Article 5 § 1 (b) of the Convention."

Whilst acknowledging that the literal wording of section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act referred only to court bailiffs ’ power to arrest people inside court - houses, the Government argued that the provision should be read in a more interpretative manner, by having regard to the general aim that was sought to be achieved by the legal provision in question. Thus, since the essence of section 76(3) of the Courts Act was to enable bailiffs to protect the administration of justice, it was only natural for the applicants, who were insulting the Tbilisi Court of Appeal in its yard, to assume that bailiffs of that court could have exercised their relevant duties not only within the court - house but also on its protected territory outside."

The Government further submitted that the initial period of the applicants ’ arrest, pending examination of the incident by the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, represented administrative arrest, a form of restraint measure in administrative proceedings, within the meaning of Article 244 of the CAO ( see paragraph 3 4 above). The Government then assured the Court that that arrest had not exceeded the maximum permissible limit of three hours, as provided for by Article 247 of the CAO (see paragraph 3 6 above). In support, the Government referred to the fact that three hours and twenty-five minutes had passed between the applicants ’ arrest and the placement of one of them in the remand centre of the Ministry of the Interior, the latter event necessarily occurring after the delivery of the decision of 29 June 2006 (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above); within that time more than twenty-five minutes would have been spent on transporting the applicants from the court - house to the place they were subsequently held in custody."

The applicants replied that their arrest was unlawful because it was clear that section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act did not empower bailiffs to arrest people outside a court - house; these officers could only “prevent offences from being committed inside a court - house”. The applicants complained that the overly extensive interpretation given to this provision by the domestic courts and the respondent Government arbitrarily expanded the territorial application of the bailiffs ’ powers of arrest, which did not meet the requirement of foreseeability and was thus unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

On the other hand, if the Code of Administrative Offences were to be considered applicable to their situation, then a clear problem would arise under its Article 246, which excluded court bailiffs from the inclusive list of those State agents who were authorised by law to effect administrative arrests (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

As to the basis for their subsequent punishment by the imposition of detention for thirty days under Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, the applicants stated that the provision similarly lacked foreseeability and precision. In support of that argument, they referred to the relevant findings of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, as well as to the subsequent amendment of that provision on 29 December 2006, which in the applicants ’ opinion constituted a tacit acknowledgment by the Georgian authorities of the defective nature of the initial version of the provision (see paragraphs 30 and 3 1 above). The applicants reiterated that they could not reasonably have foreseen that acts of theirs outside the court building could ever have led to their detention under Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP."

                "62. The Court reiterates that any deprivation of liberty must, in addition to falling within one of the exceptions set out in sub ‑ paragraphs (a) ‑ (f) of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 170, ECHR 2004 ‑ II ), be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, 29 January 2008). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 63, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 116, ECHR 2008 ). “Quality of law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, for instance, Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 71, 11 October 2007, and Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 76, 9 July 2009). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III )."

            [
                "63. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient. Article 5 § 1 of the Convention requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, § 54, Series A no. 111). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1. The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, § 67). While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith on the part of the authorities (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, § 53, 13 January 2009; Bozano, cited above, § 59; and Saadi, cited above, § 69) or where the domestic authorities have neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Liu v. Russia, no. 42086/05, § 82, 6 December 2007).",

At the outset, the Court notes that it does not need to answer the question of whether there could have been reasons for the Georgian authorities to take measures against the perceived disturbance of the public order or the need to enable the Tbilisi Court of Appeal to continue its work without being disturbed by the noise made by the applicants demonstrating outside the courthouse. What is at stake in the present case is the lawfulness of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty. The Court further observes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants ’ arrest and being locked up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by the bailiffs, as well as their subsequent punishment by detention, as imposed by the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, represented a continuous situation of deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. It can be assessed as falling into two periods – before and after the applicants were brought before the judge who sanctioned their detention in her decision of 29 June 2006."

                "65. As regards the first period of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty, the Court is ready to accept that since they were arrested on the basis of a suspicion that they had committed the offences of breach of public order and contempt of court, that period could fall within the exception authorised by 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention ( compare, for instance, with Makhmudov v. Russia, no. 35082/04, § 80 and 81, 26 July 2007, and Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 70 ). However, exercising its power to refer to the quality of the domestic law for the purposes of ascertaining the “lawfulness” of a questioned period of detention (see paragraph 6 2 above), the Court observes that the circumstances surrounding the applicants ’ arrest and being locked for some three hours in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal can hardly be held compatible with the relevant domestic provisions."

Thus, if the Court is to accept the Government ’ s argument that the applicants were taken into custody on the basis of the Code of Administrative Offences, and that their detention at that time fell within the statutory limit of three hours permitted for such administrative arrest (see paragraph 3 6 above), a clear problem would arise with respect to the powers of arrest of court bailiffs as such. The Court notes that bailiffs were not amongst the exhaustive list of those State agents who were empowered to conduct administrative arrests under that Code (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

                "67. On the other hand, as could be seen from the verbatim records of the applicants ’ arrest (see paragraph 12 above), their arrest was linked to section 76(3) § 1 of the Courts Act, notably to its sub ‑ paragraph (f), which entitled bailiffs to arrest individuals suspected of committing the offences of breach of public order and contempt of court. However, that domestic provision, which stated that bailiffs could conduct arrests “for the purpose of handing [offenders] to the police”, did not provide for any statutory time -limit during which an arrested individual could be kept in custody pending his or her appearance before a judicial officer. Consequently, it remains largely unexplained on the basis of which domestic legal provision, the court bailiffs took the liberty of locking the applicants up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal for at least three hours. Indeed, the Court notes that it was only subsequent to the applicants ’ arrest on 29 June 2006 that the Georgian legislator finally fixed, on 29 December 2006, a maximum permissible period for the duration of an arrest of an individual suspected of having committed the relevant offences (see paragraph 3 1 above)."

Another matter for the Court ’ s concern is that it cannot be discerned with a sufficient degree of certainty either from section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act, which served as the basis for the applicant ’ s arrest, or from Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, which became the basis for the subsequent finding of the applicants ’ guilt, whether it was legally possible to arrest individuals outside court - houses. The wording of these provisions limited the territorial scope of both the court bailiffs ’ powers of arrest and the offences of breach of public order and contempt to the interior of court buildings. That being so, the Court has certain doubts that the applicants could have foreseen at the relevant time and to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances that their street picket in front of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal could entail their arrest and detention under the above-mentioned domestic provisions. It reiterates in this respect that national law must be of sufficient quality and, in particular, must be foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risks of arbitrariness (see M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04, § 104, ECHR 2009)."

As regards the second period of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty, their detention for thirty days, given that the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal imposed that measure in her decision of 29 June 2006 as a punishment for the offences of breach of public order and contempt of court under Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, the Court considers that that period can fall under the exception provided for under Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention (see, for instance, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 74 and 83, and M. v. Germany, also cited above, § 87). However, the President never discussed the major legal issue of whether the bailiffs had had the power to arrest the applicants outside the court building and whether the applicants ’ behaviour out of doors could legitimately attract liability under the relevant domestic provisions. Her findings were based solely on the explanatory notes provided by the court bailiffs and, similarly to those notes, the findings lacked any detailed explanation and were strikingly succinct, and resulted in the endorsement in her decision of the obviously untrue statement that the applicants had committed the acts “inside the court building, in its central entrance” (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 17 above). It is thus evident that the judge was negligent in reviewing both the factual and the legal basis for the applicants ’ detention ( compare with Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, § 123, 10 April 2012), and exercised her authority in manifest opposition to the elementary procedural guarantees against arbitrariness provided for by the Convention ( compare with Menesheva v.

Turkey, nos. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09, § 116, 14 September 2010, and Hyde Park and Others v. Moldova (nos. 5 and 6), nos. 6991/08 and 15084/08, § 48, 14 September 2010 )."

                "87. The Court can accept the Government ’ s argument that the interference in question pursued a legitimate aim: the prevention of disorder and the protection of the authority of the judiciary. What is at stake as regards the protection of the authority of the judiciary is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, § 30, Series A no. 255 ‑ A ). The Court considers that its assessment must likewise relate to the question whether such a measure was necessary in a democratic society. Concurring with the Constitutional Court of Georgia (see paragraph 47 above), the Court reiterates in this regard that the right of peaceful assembly is, like the right to freedom of expression, one of the foundations of any democratic society. Consequently, only truly convincing and most compelling reasons can justify an interference with this right (see Djavit An, cited above, § 56, and Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, § 36, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts))."

Notably, the Court observes that the demonstration, in which just five persons participated, was dispersed a few minutes after it had started; during that extremely short period of time the applicants were able to voice only a very few slogans. Those facts already call into question the Government ’ s assertion about the level of disruption of public order (compare with Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no. 10877/04, § 44, 23 October 2008). Nor does the content of those slogans amount, in the eyes of the Court, to contempt of court or to an otherwise wrongful act. Thus, the majority of those slogans represented critical value judgments, in which the applicants, resorting to a certain degree of political exaggeration and harsh words, referred to a matter of public concern in Georgia – the independence of the judiciary; the applicants addressed the Tbilisi Court of Appeal without being violent or rejecting democratic principles in their speech. The Court reiterates in this respect that the judiciary, as with all other public institutions, cannot be immune from criticism, however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words may appear (see Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § 45, and Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, § 34, 27 May 2003 )."

The Court considers that the only offensive phrase voiced by one of the applicants during their short picket was the referral to the Minister of the Interior as “Lavrentiy Beria ’ s bastard”. However, the Court cannot understand how that expression could constitute contempt of court, as it was not addressed to a member of the judiciary (contrast with Skałka, cited above, § 36). In any event, in a democratic society, greater tolerance should be shown to those expressing opinions which are critical of important public figures, even if those opinions are expressed, as in the instant case, inarticulately, intemperately or in a provocative manner (see Hyde Park and Others (nos. 5 and 6), cited above § 43, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, §§ 52 and 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII )."

Furthermore, it is a matter of particular concern for the Court that in her decision of 29 June 2006 the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, rather than fulfilling her duty to establish convincing grounds justifying the dispersal of the demonstration and the punishment of the applicants by the imposition of detention, mostly paraphrased the general and abstract terms of the qualification of offences of breach of public order and contempt of court under the domestic law. She did not explain, by reference to the particular circumstances of the incident, how exactly the administration of justice was being obstructed and which specific phrases uttered by the applicants were considered to be severe enough to constitute contempt of court; the only matter she relied on in her decision – the statement that the applicants had held their demonstration “inside the court building, in its central entrance” – was untrue and thus unacceptable for the purpose of justification under the second paragraph of Article 11 (see, among other authorities, Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II). Consequently, restriction on the applicant ’ s right to peaceful assembly cannot be said to have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons (compare with Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § § 40 and 45; and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, §§ 63 and 64, Series A no. 30 )."

Lastly, the Court is struck by the fact that, given the absence of any violent behaviour by the applicants during the authorised picket, they were nevertheless subjected to the most severe penalty applicable to the offences in question, namely thirty days of deprivation of liberty (compare, for instance, Galstyan, cited above, § 116, in which the Court found that the sanction of deprivation of liberty for three days for participating in an authorised and peaceful street demonstration impaired the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly). The unreasonableness of the drastic penalty in the present case is further magnified when assessed against the above-mentioned absence of sufficient and relevant reasons in the underlying decision of 29 June 2006."

That labour did not fall within the exception laid down in Article 4 § 3 (a) because the applicant ’ s detention had been in breach of Article 5 § § 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the Convention.

The work was to be carried out while the applicant was in custody and under the full control of the authorities.

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 11332/04, 12 May 2009). The Court sees not reason to depart from its findings in that decision."

                "31. In particular, the fact that the applicant ’ s detention was ordered by the Tsarevo District Court by reference to a Decree rather than an Act of Parliament does not make it unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Under Bulgarian law, decrees adopted by the Presidium of the National Assembly under Article 35 § 5 and Article 36 of the 1947 Constitution are valid sources of law which have the same force as Acts of Parliament. This has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 10 above) and is implicit in the fact that the Constitutional Court accepted to hear a legal challenge to the 1963 Decree much as it would accept to hear a challenge to an Act of Parliament ( see paragraph 13 above ). The term “law” in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention must be understood in its substantive sense, not its formal one. The Court has accepted that detention may be based on a sufficiently established custom (see Drozd and Janousek v. France and Spain, 26 June 1992, § 107, Series A no. 240 ) or on case ‑ law (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII ). It has adopted the same stance to the term “law” as used in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A, and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 47, Series A no. 30 ). It follows that the applicant ’ s detention was provided by Bulgarian law and was imposed in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law ( see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § § 46 ‑ 49, 15 November 2007 ). There is no indication that it was otherwise incompatible with Article 5 § 1."

Belgium, 18 November 1970, § 89, Series A no. 12, and Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24 June 1982, § 59, Series A no. 50 ). In any event, there is no appearance of a breach of Article 5 § 4, since judicial control of the detention during which the applicant was required to work was incorporated in the Tsarevo District Court ’ s decision (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp, cited above, § 76)."

The fact that that work was not remunerated did not in itself cause it to fall outside that definition. In its decision in Twenty ‑ one Detained Persons v. Germany ( nos. 3134/67, 3172/67, 3188 ‑ 3206/67, Commission decision of 6 April 1968, Collection 27, pp. 97 ‑ 116), the former Commission declared a complaint in that respect inadmissible, noting, inter alia, that Article 4 does not contain any provision concerning the remuneration of prisoners for their work, and observing that it had consistently rejected applications by prisoners claiming higher remuneration for their work. The Court is mindful that there have been subsequent developments in attitudes to that issue, reflected in particular in the 1987 and 2006 European Prison Rules, which call for the equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners – with the 2006 Rules adding “in all instances” – (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above). Those Rules, and the modification in their wording, reflect an evolving trend. However, the Court does not consider that as matters stood at the time when the applicant was ordered to carry out the work at issue in the present case – approximately two years before the adoption of the 2006 Rules – it could be maintained that there existed an unconditional obligation under Article 4 of the Convention to remunerate the work of all detainees in all circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132 ). The Court additionally notes that the applicant ’ s detention was effected under special rules designed to deal in a speedy way with minor public order offences, and that the period during which the applicant was detained and required to work without remuneration could not by law exceed, and did not in fact exceed, fifteen days (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). This can hardly be compared to the situation of inmates who have worked many years in prison (see Stummer, cited above, § 130 in limine )."
