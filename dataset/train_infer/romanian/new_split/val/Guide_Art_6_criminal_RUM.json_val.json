As far as the French text is concerned, the applicant did not have - in the terminology of Belgian domestic law - the status of accusé when the Louvain procureur du Roi wrote to him on 30 September 1974; furthermore, as is stated at the end of section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act, no proposal for settlement may be made once proceedings for the offence have been instituted before the trial court (see paragraphs 9 and 15 above).",

And the \"reasonable time\" may on occasion \"start to run from a date prior to the seisin of the trial court, of the ‘ tribunal ’ competent for the ‘ determination ... of [the] criminal charge ’\" (see the Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 15, par. 32). The Wemhoff and Neumeister judgments of 27 June 1968 and then the Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971 took as the starting-point the moment of arrest, the moment when the person was officially notified that he would be prosecuted and the moment when preliminary investigations were opened, respectively (Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, par. 19; Series A no. 8, p. 41, par. 18; and Series A no. 13, p. 45, par. 110)."

Provisional closure of that type was ordered in the context of judicial proceedings already instituted or imminent and could thus precede a sentence of closure imposed by a court of law in pursuance of section 9 par. 5.

The first consisted of paying over a certain sum of money which might, if appropriate, be greater than the maximum fine fixed by the Act.

It is true that the Government had not pleaded non-exhaustion on this point but it would have been difficult for them to do so in the circumstances; annulment was hypothetical at the time and did not occur until 31 May 1978, by which date the case had already been at the stage of deliberations for more than six months and reopening the hearings could scarcely have been envisaged (see paragraph 20 above and Appendix I to the Commission ’ s report).

This remedy, added the Government, \"was the most radical because it allowed\" the applicant to claim the retroactive invalidation of \"the legislation creating the offence\"; the judgments delivered by the Conseil d ’ État on 5 July 1973 and 31 May 1978 were said to have demonstrated the remedy ’ s effectiveness (see paragraph 20 above).

Again, the inspection carried out by Mr. Vanderleyden in Mr. Deweer ’ s shop formed part of the continuing process of controlling observance of the statutes and regulations on the country ’ s economic life (see the \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974: \"toezicht op de wets - en reglementsbeschikkingen betreffende ’ s Lands economisch leven\"); the inspection was not performed within the context of the repression of crime. The \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974 was forwarded to the procureur du Roi \"for information and decision\", \"voor kennisgeving en beschikking\" (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above) so that it was for him to decide upon the appropriate action. In his letter of 30 September 1974, the procureur du Roi - while advising the applicant of the closure of his establishment - offered him a means of \"avoiding prosecution\", namely payment of the sum of 10,000 BF. Criminal proceedings had not as yet been instituted when they were barred by the payment made on 2 October (section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act, paragraphs 9-11 and 15 above)."

However, the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see especially the above-mentioned Airey judgment, pp. 12-13, par. 24) prompts the Court to prefer a \"substantive\", rather than a \"formal\", conception of the \"charge\" contemplated by Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1). The Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question."
            ],
            [
                "45. When seen in this light, the relevant provisions of the Belgian legislation (see paragraphs 12-15 above) prove to be enlightening. The source of the 1945/1971 Act is a Legislative Decree published during the Second World War, in the middle of a time of shortages, rationing and the \"black market\". Through a series of drastic measures, this Legislative Decree set on foot \"the repression of offences against rules relating to the country ’ s supplies\". The return to conditions of plenty has enabled its severity to be relaxed and its title to be changed, but even the existing text still carries the imprint of its origin. The wording employed bears witness to this. Thus, paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 11, the basis of the contested decisions by the Louvain procureur du Roi, utilise terms such as \"offender\" and \"offence\". In addition, anyone who contravenes a Decree passed in pursuance of Part I of the Act, as for instance the Decree of 9 August 1974, is liable to the penalties listed in section 9, that is to say imprisonment, fine, forfeitures, court ordered closure of premises and publicising of the judgment. The offer of settlement made on 30 September 1974 was in effect a substitute for at least certain of those penalties. Had the applicant rejected the offer, the accompanying decision of provisional closure would have come into operation, if need be until \"the date on which judgment [was] passed on the offence\" (section 11 par. 2); he would have risked imprisonment and a fine if he had disregarded the closure decision (sections 9 par. 5 (b) and 11 par. 2 read in conjunction).",
                "Similarly, the \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974 described Mr. Deweer as being \"in breach\" (\"in overtreding\") of Articles 2 par. 4 and 3 par. 1 of the Decree of 9 August 1974 (see paragraph 8 above). In his decision of 30 September, the Louvain procureur du Roi also mentioned an \"offence\" (\"een inbreuk\"); although he judged it unnecessary to request imprisonment as punishment for the offence (\"dat geen hoofdgevangenisstraf dient gevorderd te worden ter beteugeling van gezegd misdrijf\"), the procureur du Roi stressed its \"gravity\" (\"de ernst\"). By letter of the same date, he drew the applicant ’ s especial attention to the \"heavy penalties\" (\"strenge straffen\") under the Act for failure to comply with the closure order (see paragraph 9 above).",
                "The closure order, as the Government have well shown, was made \"in the normal course of the criminal proceedings that had to be taken following the offence reported against Mr. Deweer\". The order was a prelude to \"criminal proceedings\" which the procureur du Roi contemplated instituting if the \"offender\" were to refuse a friendly settlement.",
                "In addition, the Government stressed the applicant ’ s alleged \"confession\" to the inspector, Mr. Vanderleyden, and the \"flagrant offence\" whose commission they claimed Mr. Deweer \"acknowledged on the spot\". In their view, in agreeing to \"pay the fine by way of settlement\" - \"a kind of compensation to the community for his reprehensible conduct\" - the applicant had admitted his \"guilt\", \"perhaps not explicitly but in substance\" (see page 34 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission).",
                "Although such a fine is not assimilated to a penalty, its payment had, in any event, to be mentioned in the information extracts supplied by municipalities for inclusion in criminal files (see paragraph 15 above)."

                "46. There accordingly exists a combination of concordant factors conclusively demonstrating that the case has a criminal character under the Convention. The \"charge\" could, for the purposes of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), be defined as the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence. In several decisions and opinions the Commission has adopted a test that appears to be fairly closely related, namely whether \"the situation of the [suspect] has been substantially affected\" ( Neumeister case, Series B no. 6, p. 81; case of Huber v. Austria, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 18, p. 356, 67; case of Hätti v. Federal Republic of Germany, ibid., vol. 19, p. 1064, 50, etc.).

The French text of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) contains the term \"bien-fondé\" which, the Court recalls, refers to the charge being well-founded in law as well as in fact (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, p. 14). Before the trial court, the applicant would therefore have been entitled not only to rely, as he did before Mr. Vanderleyden, on his good faith or the additional costs incurred by a butcher buying on the hoof (see paragraph 8 above) but also to plead that the Decree of 9 August 1974 was contrary to the Constitution or incompatible with Community law (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Mr. Deweer would in addition have enjoyed the benefit of the guarantees in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3)."

                "49. The \"right to a court\", which is a constituent element of the right to a fair trial, is no more absolute in criminal than in civil matters. It is subject to implied limitations, two examples of which are given at paragraph 58 of the Commission ’ s report (decision not to prosecute and order for discontinuance of the proceedings); it is not the Court ’ s function, though, to elaborate a general theory of such limitations (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 18-19, par. 36 and 38-39).",
                "The current proceedings do not, however, concern a limitation of that nature. By paying the 10,000 BF which the Louvain procureur du Roi \"required\" by way of settlement (see paragraph 9 above), Mr. Deweer waived his right to have his case dealt with by a tribunal.",
                "In the Contracting States ’ domestic legal systems a waiver of this kind is frequently encountered both in civil matters, notably in the shape of arbitration clauses in contracts, and in criminal matters in the shape, inter alia, of fines paid by way of composition. The waiver, which has undeniable advantages for the individual concerned as well as for the administration of justice, does not in principle offend against the Convention; on this point the Court shares the view of the Commission (see paragraphs 55-56 of the report; decision of 5. 3. 1962, application no. 1197/61, X v. Republic of Germany, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 5, pp. 94-96).",
                "Nevertheless, in a democratic society too great an importance attaches to the \"right to a court\" (see paragraph 44 above) for its benefit to be forfeited solely by reason of the fact that an individual is a party to a settlement reached in the course of a procedure ancillary to court proceedings. In an area concerning the public order ( ordre public) of the member States of the Council of Europe, any measure or decision alleged to be in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) calls for particularly careful review (see, for Article 5 (art. 5), the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 36, par. 65). The Court is not unaware of the firmness with which the Belgian courts have condemned, on the basis of Article 8 of the Constitution and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, failure to respect the \"right to a court\" in private legal relationships (see, for example, the Brussels Civil Court, 23. 11. 1967, Journal des Tribunaux 1967, p. 741; compare the Court of Cassation, 1. 6. 1966, with the final submissions of Advocate General Mahaux, Pasicrisie 1966, pp. 1249-1250 and 1251-1252). At least the same degree of vigilance would appear indispensable when someone formerly \"charged with a criminal offence\" challenges a settlement that has barred criminal proceedings. Absence of constraint is at all events one of the conditions to be satisfied; this much is dictated by an international instrument founded on freedom and the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 16-17, par. 34). Here again, the Court concurs with the Commission."
            ],
            [
                "50. In paragraph 57 of its report, the Commission expressed the opinion that there was constraint in the present case : it considered that the applicant waived the guarantees of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) only \"under the threat of [the] serious prejudice\" that the closure of his shop would have caused him."
            ],
            [
                "51. (a) The Government ’ s first submission was as follows: the offer of settlement made to Mr. Deweer on 30 September 1974 amounted in law to no more than a \"proposal for a friendly settlement\" which he could quite well have rejected; \"in accepting the offer and acting upon it on 2 October\", the applicant, \"by paying a relatively modest sum, succeeded in avoiding the risk of receiving a sentence which might have been more severe than this fine paid by way of settlement\" and \"which might, if appropriate, have been accompanied by a court order for the closure of the establishment\" (section 9 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above).",
                "Furthermore, the Government maintained, the Commission ’ s reasoning is inconsistent. Whereas the procedure followed in the circumstances is stated at paragraph 57 of the report to be in breach of the Convention for the reason that it was tainted with constraint, paragraphs 55 and 59 contain the recognition that settlement of criminal cases is legitimate. In a sense, so the argument continued, that kind of settlement \"always takes place under some form of ‘ constraint ’ and under the ‘ threat ’ of more or less ‘ serious ’ prejudice\"; thus, criminal proceedings represent, \"for the majority of those\" against whom they are taken \"or likely to be taken, something to be feared\" and, in very many instances, \"a sufficiently serious ‘ threat ’ to encourage [them] ... to forgo\" the trial of their case by a court of law.",
                "(b) The Court points out that while the prospect of having to appear in court is certainly liable to prompt a willingness to compromise on the part of many persons \"charged with a criminal offence\", the pressure thereby brought to bear is in no way incompatible with the Convention: provided that the requirements of Articles 6 and 7 (art. 6, art. 7) are observed, the Convention in principle leaves the Contracting States free to designate and prosecute as a criminal offence conduct not constituting the normal exercise of one of the rights it protects (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 34, par. 81).",
                "Moreover, the applicant was probably scarcely apprehensive about criminal prosecution since it was not unlikely that prosecution would result in an acquittal, perhaps proceeded by a request to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The \"constraint\" complained of by the applicant was to be found in another quarter, namely in the closure order of 30 September 1974.",
                "This order was due to come into effect forty-eight hours after notification of the decision of the procureur du Roi and it could have remained in force until the date on which the competent court passed judgment on the offence (sections II par. 2 and 9 par. 5 (b) of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above). In the meantime, that is possibly during a period of months, the applicant would have been deprived of the income accruing from his trade; he would nonetheless have incurred the risk of having to continue to pay his staff and of not being able to resume business with all his former customers once his shop reopened (see pages 2, 7, 46, 47 and 49 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission; and the note of the hearings of 27 September 1979 - the reply given by the applicants ’ counsel to the Court ’ s third question). Mr. Deweer would have suffered considerable loss as a consequence.",
                "The Louvain procureur du Roi did admittedly offer Mr. Deweer a means of avoiding the danger, namely by paying 10,000 BF in \"friendly settlement\" (see paragraph 9 above). This solution certainly represented by far a lesser evil. As the Government rightly pointed out, the sum in question was only slightly above the minimum amount - 3,000 BF - of \"the fine laid down by law\", whereas under section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act it could have been more than the maximum, namely 30,000,000 BF (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Accordingly, as the Delegates observed, there was a \"flagrant disproportion\" between the two alternatives facing the applicant. The \"relative moderation\" of the sum demanded in fact tells against the Government ’ s argument since it added to the pressure brought to bear by the closure order. The moderation rendered the pressure so compelling that it is not surprising that Mr. Deweer yielded."
            ],
            [
                "52. Pleading as to the merits and not as to admissibility (see paragraph 26 above), the Government put forward a second objection. They maintained that nothing prevented Mr. Deweer from refusing a \"friendly settlement\" and challenging the decision of the procureur du Roi by bringing \"an action tot recover damages for the loss suffered as a result of the closure of his establishment\", or \"the excessive length of such closure\", and by making an \"application for interim measures\" \"to have the closure suspended\" (see paragraph 44 of the Commission ’ s report).",
                "(a) On the latter point, the Government invoked Article 584 of the Belgian Judicial Code, a provision that could be applied in \"a wide variety of circumstances\" although up till now, they said, it would not appear to have been relied on in any comparable case : \"The President of the Court of First Instance shall, in respect of all matters except those which the law excludes from the jurisdiction of the courts of justice, give a provisional ruling in cases which he recognises as being urgent.\"",
                "The Delegates, for their part, did not believe that a \"provisional measure ordered by the prosecuting authorities\" could, in its turn, be the subject of another \"provisional measure\" decreed by a civil court with the object of countermanding the former measure, especially since in Belgium civil proceedings must await the outcome of criminal proceedings (\"le pénal tient le civil en état \").",
                "The Court shares the Delegates ’ scepticism and would add the following considerations to those which they advanced. As the Government themselves pointed out, \"an application for interim measures is normally accessory to a principal claim\" and, as is laid down by Article 1039 of the Judicial Code, \"orders for interim measures are made without prejudice to the merits\". However, the Court does not perceive which court having to deal with the \"merits\" of the case could have ordered discontinuance of the impugned closure by relying, for example, on the Constitution or the Convention. Whilst section 2 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act allows an appeal, having suspensive effect, against closure decisions issued by the Minister of Economic Affairs to be made to the judge in chambers at the Court of First Instance with jurisdiction in criminal matters, no right of appeal against closure decisions emanating from the procureur du Roi is granted by the Act (see paragraph 13 above).",
                "(b) As for suing for damages in respect of the loss caused by the closure, the Government did not specify in what form they conceived such an action. In Belgium, there are strict rules on the personal liability of officers serving in the public prosecutor ’ s department (parquet). Thus, they \"can be called to account\" (\"la prise à partie \") only \"if they have been guilty of deceit or fraud\", \"if the law declares them to be liable in damages\" or if the law \"expressly\" stipulates that they are to be called to account (Articles 1140 and 1141 of the Judicial Code, taken together). The Government did not allege that any of these conditions was satisfied in the present case. Neither did they indicate in what way the decision of the Louvain procureur du Roi could entail liability on the part of the authorities.",
                "It is not for the Court to deal with issues of Belgian domestic law which are apparently unsettled and on which the Government have not supplied sufficient information. The Court confines itself to noting that the applicant, who was faced with a serious and immediate peril, quite naturally attended to the most pressing matter first without embarking on hazardous legal speculations; the Court cannot reproach him for doing so."
            ],
            [
                "53. The Government finally stressed that \"the Commission admitted\" that \"the outright closure\" of the shop would have been reconcilable with the Convention, even though \"so radical a solution would certainly have cost the applicant more than 10,000 [Belgian] francs\". From this premise, they described the logic of the reasoning followed in the report as \"curious\", submitting that, \"still according to the Commission\", the breach of Article 6 (art. 6) stemmed in substance from a \"favour\" granted to Mr. Deweer, namely the offer of a settlement whereby the procureur du Roi was to adopt a solution milder, more flexible and less burdensome than closure. In this way, claimed the Government, an \"absurd conclusion\" was reached.",
                "The Court recalls that it is limiting its examination to the combined use of the two procedures (see paragraph 40 above); it has no intention of ruling whether a closure order unaccompanied by any offer of settlement would have been compatible with the Convention.",
                "The Court further notes, as did the Delegates, that the situation suggested by the Government has never occurred in practice, except in the immediate post-war period when shortages were prevalent and the economy was under great strain. Since 1946, procureurs du Roi have utilised paragraph 2 of section 11 of the 1945/1971 Act solely in conjunction with paragraph 1; on the other hand, they have frequently applied paragraph 1 without paragraph 2 (see paragraph 15 above, last sub-paragraph).",
                "Besides, in the area of human rights he who can do more cannot necessarily do less. The Convention permits under certain conditions some very serious forms of treatment, such as the death penalty (Article 2 par. 1, second sentence) (art. 2-1), whilst at the same time prohibiting others which by comparison can be regarded as rather mild, for example \"unlawful\" detention for a brief period (Article 5 par. 1) (art. 5-1) or the expulsion of a national (Article 3 par. 1 of Protocol No. 4) (P4-3-1). The fact that it is possible to inflict on a person one of the first-mentioned forms of treatment cannot authorise his being subjected to one of the second-mentioned, even if he agrees or acquiesces (see, mutatis mutandis, the Commission ’ s report in the De Becker case, Series B no. 2, pp. 90-91, 101-102 and 124-125)."

In that connection, it notes that their characterisation within the domestic legal order is open to different interpretations. In any event, the domestic legal order ’ s characterisation of a penalty cannot, by itself, be decisive for determining whether or not the penalty is criminal in nature. Other factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned, have to be taken into account (see Tyler v. the United Kingdom, application no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77, pp. 81-86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in general, exclusion orders are not classified as criminal within the member States of the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States may also be made by the administrative authorities, constitute a special preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control and do not concern the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant for the purposes of Article 6 § 1. The fact that they are imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot alter their essentially preventive nature. It follows that proceedings for rescission of such measures cannot be regarded as being in the criminal sphere either (see, mutatis mutandis, Renna v. France, application no. 32809/96, Commission ’ s decision of 26 February 1997, unreported)."

They did not deny the existence of a dispute, but maintained that no civil rights had been at stake. The exclusion order had been made against the applicant as a result of his failure to comply with an order for his deportation from France and the main issue, therefore, had been his right to stay in France. Accordingly, the measure was based on public-order considerations that did not concern civil law. The Government pointed out that the Commission had consistently expressed the view that proceedings relating to the entry, stay and deportation of aliens were outside the scope of that Article in so far as it concerned disputes over civil rights and obligations, the reason being that the acts in issue in such proceedings were governed by public law and represented the exercise of public-authority prerogatives. The fact that deportation orders generally had pecuniary or family implications for those concerned could not suffice to bring them within the civil limb of Article 6 § 1, as that would mean that all measures concerning immigration control were caught by the scope of that provision since they produced similar consequences for those on whom they were imposed. The Government concluded that litigation relating to exclusion orders, like all litigation concerning immigration control, could not be a civil dispute for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

                "29. The Government further pointed out that under the Commission ’ s settled case-law, deportation and exclusion orders did not concern criminal charges or amount to punishment for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government agreed with that analysis, which was based on the elementary observation that exclusion orders were not penalties, but administrative measures, even if, unusually, the legislature had assigned the task of making such orders to the criminal courts. Indeed, that observation was supported by the fact that under the laws of most States the administrative authorities were also competent to make such orders, the purpose being not to punish a specific act but to deter foreign nationals from further infringing the legislation on the entry and stay of aliens. The aim of exclusion orders was therefore essentially preventive. It was that special characteristic that made it possible to request the rescission of such orders, no equivalent remedy being available for criminal penalties in the strict sense. Referring to the criteria established by the Court ’ s case-law for determining whether a particular penalty was criminal in character, the Government contended that it appeared clear that an exclusion order could not be regarded as a penalty or as criminal in character for the purposes of the Convention. It was a measure peculiar to immigration control and one far removed from the context of ordinary criminal proceedings."
            ],
            [
                "30. The Government observed that in any event, however exclusion orders were classified, and even if they were classified as criminal penalties, it was common ground that proceedings for the rescission of such orders did not entail the court “determining” a criminal charge against the applicant. Such proceedings did not entail any decision by the relevant court on the merits of the charge. The court did not decide whether the applicant was guilty of the offence forming the basis of the exclusion order. Indeed, the arguments generally relied on by applicants when seeking rescission of an exclusion order showed that the debate focused on the applicant ’ s personal circumstances, which, by definition, did not concern the validity of the earlier conviction. The court to which the application for rescission was made merely had to decide whether or not it should remain in effect. Indeed, when applications for rescission were lodged, the applicant was no longer a “person charged” since such applications were precluded unless the conviction had become final. Therefore applications for rescission of exclusion orders did not concern the penalty itself, but its enforcement. That observation had, moreover, led the Commission to express the opinion that the criminal limb of Article 6 § 1 was not applicable to disputes concerning applications for the rescission of such orders."

In addition, the Court observes that the preamble to that instrument refers to the need to take “further steps to ensure the collective enforcement of certain rights and freedoms by means of the Convention ...”. Taken together, those provisions show that the States were aware that Article 6 § 1 did not apply to procedures for the expulsion of aliens and wished to take special measures in that sphere.

Other factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned, have to be taken into account (see Tyler v. the United Kingdom, application no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77, pp. 81-86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in general, exclusion orders are not classified as criminal within the member States of the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States may also be made by the administrative authorities, constitute a special preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control and do not concern the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant for the purposes of Article 6 § 1. The fact that they are imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot alter their essentially preventive nature. It follows that proceedings for rescission of such measures cannot be regarded as being in the criminal sphere either (see, mutatis mutandis, Renna v. France, application no. 32809/96, Commission ’ s decision of 26 February 1997, unreported)."

It is true that the Court has generally held that Article 6 § 1 under its criminal head does not apply to proceedings relating to the execution of a final criminal sentence (see Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 97, 17 September 2009 ). However, the Court has also held that in the event of conviction, there is no “determination ... of any criminal charge”, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, as long as the sentence is not definitively fixed (see Eckle v.

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that, from a technical point of view, the applicant's conviction became final on 26 August 2002 when he waived his right to appeal against the Lübeck Regional Court's judgment of that date. The Court considers, however, that under the particular circumstances of this case it has to be taken into account that the proceedings relating to the applicant's transfer request were very closely related to the criminal proceedings and to the final determination of the sentence. The Court notes, in particular, that the Public Prosecutor, during the proceedings leading to the applicant's conviction, expressly declared that they had no reservations about the transfer of the defendant to the Netherlands. The applicant gave a full confession leading to his criminal conviction on the strength of this reassurance. Although the Lübeck Regional Court imposed a criminal sentence based on the applicant's conviction, this was not to be considered as final having regard to the possibility of converting the sentence following a transfer to the applicant's home country."

The Court therefore considers that the transfer proceedings have to be regarded as an integral part of the criminal proceedings in so far as they directly relate to the assurance which was given by the Public Prosecutor during the criminal proceedings."

It is therefore acceptable if this part of the decision is not subject to judicial review. Accordingly, the Court has previously held that Article 6 § 1 was not applicable to proceedings under the Transfer Convention (see Csoszánski v. Sweden (dec.), no. 22318/02, 27 June 2006; Szabo v. Sweden (dec.), no. 28578/03, 27 June 2006; and Veermae v. Finland (dec.), no. 38704/03, 15 March 2005).

It is true that the Court has generally held that Article 6 § 1 under its criminal head does not apply to proceedings relating to the execution of a final criminal sentence (see Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 97, 17 September 2009 ). However, the Court has also held that in the event of conviction, there is no “determination ... of any criminal charge”, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, as long as the sentence is not definitively fixed (see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, § 77, Series A no. 51)."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that, from a technical point of view, the applicant's conviction became final on 26 August 2002 when he waived his right to appeal against the Lübeck Regional Court's judgment of that date. The Court considers, however, that under the particular circumstances of this case it has to be taken into account that the proceedings relating to the applicant's transfer request were very closely related to the criminal proceedings and to the final determination of the sentence. The Court notes, in particular, that the Public Prosecutor, during the proceedings leading to the applicant's conviction, expressly declared that they had no reservations about the transfer of the defendant to the Netherlands. The applicant gave a full confession leading to his criminal conviction on the strength of this reassurance. Although the Lübeck Regional Court imposed a criminal sentence based on the applicant's conviction, this was not to be considered as final having regard to the possibility of converting the sentence following a transfer to the applicant's home country."

Having regard to these exceptionally close connections between the criminal proceedings and the proceedings concerning the applicant's transfer request, it would be too formalistic to limit the scope of application of Article 6 under its criminal head to the proceedings which took place before pronouncement of the judgment on 26 August 2002. The Court therefore considers that the transfer proceedings have to be regarded as an integral part of the criminal proceedings in so far as they directly relate to the assurance which was given by the Public Prosecutor during the criminal proceedings."

                "43. The Court is aware of the fact that the decision taken by the Justice Ministry on the transfer request does not solely depend on the public prosecutor's recommendations and on considerations regarding the execution of sentence, but also on considerations of foreign policy which fall within the core area of public law. It is therefore acceptable if this part of the decision is not subject to judicial review. Accordingly, the Court has previously held that Article 6 § 1 was not applicable to proceedings under the Transfer Convention (see Csoszánski v. Sweden (dec.), no. 22318/02, 27 June 2006; Szabo v. Sweden (dec.), no. 28578/03, 27 June 2006; and Veermae v. Finland (dec.), no. 38704/03, 15 March 2005). However, in those cases the Transfer Convention was not prospectively influencing the course of the trial and the fixing of the sentence, because no assurance was given by the public prosecution before or during the criminal proceedings."

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Dalia v.

While the applicant had no right to judicial review of the exercise of discretion in so far as the decision was based on general – in particular foreign policy – considerations, judicial review of the discretionary powers in respect of law enforcement remained unaffected thereby, in particular with regard to the statement made on the day of the trial by the Lübeck Public Prosecutor.

Nevertheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. The requirement of access to court must be entrenched not only in law but also in practice, failing which the remedy lacks the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities, Moldovan v.

Confiscation was in no way linked to whether those third persons had been charged with a crime or convicted. On the contrary, pursuant to the aforementioned provision, confiscation of the proceeds of the crime had to be ordered both when imposing a punishment and when a person has been released from criminal liability and even in the event that he or she had not even been charged with a crime."

However, it has been forgotten that not only M.S. but also other persons had been charged in the criminal proceedings in question. Those other persons had smuggled goods together with M.S., and the illicit gains had been obtained together. Some of those co-accused had been released from criminal liability, but three of the co-accused, J.M., K.K. and V.V., were convicted. For Article 72 § 3 of the Criminal Code to be applied, it was not important that the third persons to whom the property had been transferred should be family members or relatives of the person who committed the crime. Moreover, even presuming that it was M.S. who had transferred the property to his wife, his parents and his parents-in-law, it did not mean that that property had been obtained from the criminal activity of him alone. In the present case that property had been obtained as a result of the criminal activities of all co-accused, including those who had been convicted. Furthermore, V.V., who was M.S.’s cousin, had played a very important role in the activities of the criminal organisation. Accordingly, the persons to whom the confiscated property had been transferred were connected by family links not only to M.S., who died, but also to V.V., who was convicted. These circumstances totally rebut the appellant’s contention that the property had been confiscated after the proceedings had been discontinued, because in reality confiscation had been ordered after [the trial court] adopted an accusatory judgment”."

In the appellate court’s view, the trial court’s findings had been reasonable. Even so, the appellate court again went through the evidence and upheld the trial court’s findings, dismissing E.J.’s arguments to the effect that the two confiscated items in the applicant’s ownership had a lawful provenance (see paragraph 19 above)."

Seven countries (Albania, Germany, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland) provide for confiscation orders regardless of conviction. This type of confiscation order generally covers property that has been acquired though unlawful activities. As long as the origin cannot be justified, confiscation of such property may be imposed. Criminal liability of the offender is not relevant for the purposes of the confiscation order. For example, in Germany a court may order the confiscation of the proceeds of the crime despite the fact that the proceedings have been discontinued, as long as it can be established that a wrongful act has indeed been committed."

Estonia and the Russian Federation allow confiscation of property which constitutes material evidence in limited circumstances.

Neither was Article 6 applicable under its “civil head”, given that no question concerning the applicant’s property rights in the sense of civil law had been determined. In the Government’s view, the confiscation of certain property imposed on the applicant was merely a preventive measure, aiming at deterrence of serious crimes based on property reasons.

The Court considers that it is not called upon to examine in abstracto the compatibility with the Convention of the provisions of the Lithuanian criminal law, which oblige the court to confiscate money and property which have been acquired in a criminal manner, including property transferred to third persons. Instead, the Court must determine whether the way in which the confiscation was applied in respect of the applicant offended the basic principles of a fair procedure inherent in Article 6 § 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, § 30, Series A no. 141-A).

Whilst noting that the applicant indeed was not a party to the criminal proceedings against the criminal organisation, the Court considers that the system in question was not without safeguards. It notes, first, that the confiscation of the applicant’s property had its origins in a measure taken by the investigating authorities, namely seizure of her assets in 2000. The Court considers that it was open to the applicant to institute judicial review proceedings to challenge the reasons for that seizure and present evidence that those items of property had been acquired lawfully. Whilst acknowledging that the seizure was only a temporary measure, having no conclusive influence over the subsequent confiscation, the Court is of the view that at that time the applicant could reasonably foresee that the seizure could result in confiscation of the property at a later stage of the proceedings. Accordingly, this was an occasion for the applicant to present her arguments and thus to obtain the lifting of the seizure. On this last point the Court also notes that, as it appears from the facts of the case, M.S.’s mother was successful in her plea that some of the seized property had been acquired lawfully, given that seizure of some of the assets was lifted (see paragraph 11 above). Lastly and even though having certain reservations as to the Government’s suggestion that the applicant could have explained the origin of her property had she chosen to testify in the criminal proceedings against the criminal organisation, the Court nonetheless finds that that was one more occasion for her to put forward any evidence in support of her claims.

The Court has particular regard to the fact that in his appeal and cassation appeal E.J. explicitly raised the matter of confiscation, arguing that the property belonged to third persons whose fault had not been established. In particular, E.J. challenged the confiscation in respect of each item of property, including those belonging to the applicant (see paragraphs 19 and 26 above). In these circumstances, the Court shares the Government’s view that if the applicant had any evidence to adduce to prove that her property came from legitimate sources, she could have passed that information on to E.J., the lawyer of her choice (see Bongiorno and Others v.

With regard to the application of the presumption of innocence, the Court’s case-law also shows that the autonomous meaning of the expression “charge” in Article 6 of the Convention means that a person can be considered to have been “charged” for the purposes of that Article when that individual’s situation has been “substantially affected” (see Serves v.

It had been obtained from illicit proceeds of criminal activities of the entire criminal organisation (see paragraph 24 above). To decide this point the trial court had regard to the fact that when purchasing the confiscated apartment the applicant had taken a loan from the mother of the convicted V.V., who, in turn, could not explain the provenance of his mother’s possessions. As to the shares in the telecommunications company, they had been purchased through the off-shore company that the criminal organisation used to launder the money gained through passing contraband. The Court sees no reason to depart from the appellate court’s findings, which were based on its direct knowledge of the facts of the case and the domestic law. Accordingly, the Court holds that the order to confiscate some of the applicant’s property was not related to any finding of guilt on the part of the applicant in respect of the crimes allegedly committed by her late husband. Lastly, the Court cannot fail to observe that the present case is distinguishable from the facts in A.P., M.P. and T.P., where new proceedings had been opened against the applicants, whereas in the instant case the criminal proceedings against M.S. and his co-accused merely continued after his death."

For the same reasons, even assuming that the applicant herself could be regarded as being “charged” with a criminal offence, the Court also considers that the confiscation order did not constitute a finding of the applicant’s personal guilt for any offence. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.",

She contended that she had not been aware of the unlawful origins of the confiscated property. The applicant admitted that, as the spouse of M.S., she could have known about the movement of merchandise; however, the domestic courts had not established that she was aware that crimes were being committed. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, in the other criminal proceedings (paragraphs 28-30 above), the applicant was convicted for crimes not linked to those of M.S. Whilst acknowledging that she had knowledge of the enterprises that her late husband and the co-accused used in their operations, the applicant maintained that those enterprises “had been engaged in lawful activities [in addition to unlawful ones]”. For the applicant, there was no public interest to deprive her of her property. Lastly, she contended that the domestic courts’ decisions had been erroneous in that they had incorrectly established the evidence proving that the confiscated property was the proceeds of crime."

In any event, the confiscation of part of the family’s property had been in accordance with domestic law (Article 72 § 3 of the Criminal Code) and amounted to a justified control of the use of property in the general interest. Referring to the Court’s case-law ( Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A), the Government contended that, in the interests of crime prevention, the State had a wide margin of appreciation in controlling property obtained by unlawful means or used for unlawful purposes. Referring to the decision of the Court of Appeal of 25 October 2004 and the applicant’s conviction on 30 June 2005, the Government considered that a fair balance between the public and individual interests had been achieved in the present case, particularly as the applicant, with her knowledge of her husband’s criminal activities, must have known full well that the property in question had been obtained from money gained unlawfully."

The unlawfulness of the origin of the property at issue and the fact that the applicant ought to have been aware and could have been aware that the disputed property had been acquired from criminal acts had been proven during the criminal proceedings, following strict standards of substantiation. The Government reiterated that when deciding upon confiscation of the seized items, the Kaunas Regional Court had lifted seizure of many items – plot of land, house and its contents – that had been registered in the names of the applicant and her late husband. The seizure of those items had been lifted because the trial court had not established that that property had been acquired as a result of criminal activity. Only two items in the applicant’s ownership – the apartment and shares in a telecommunications company – had been confiscated."

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 44, ECHR 1999-V)."

On the facts of the case the Court recalls that the “possessions” at issue were the shares in a telecommunication company and an apartment which were confiscated from the applicant by a judicial decision. It is not in dispute between the parties that the confiscation order amounted to an interference with the applicant’s right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions and that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is therefore applicable. It remains to be determined whether the measure was covered by the first or second paragraph of that Convention provision."

Russia, no. 31004/02, § 25, 5 February 2009 and case-law cited therein). Accordingly, it considers that the same approach must be followed in the present case."

In addition, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims sought to be realised. In other words, the Court must determine whether a balance was struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. In doing so it leaves the State a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Yildirim v. Italy (dec.), no. 38602/02, ECHR 2003-IV)."

In the present case, however, they had never failed to appear in court and had complied whenever summoned by judges or experts. Before the Court of Cassation they had instructed a lawyer (Mr Monod) to represent them and they had not left the address given as their place of residence in the case file. There was accordingly no proportionality between their failure to comply with the arrest warrants and the sanction that had been imposed for that reason. The Code of Criminal Procedure did not lay down any positive obligation to surrender to custody and it had not been asserted that they had resisted any attempts to enforce the warrants."

Access to the Court of Cassation was not denied to an absconding defendant but only made subject to certain conditions intended to ensure a fair balance between the protection of public interests and respect for the rights of the defence. In the present case the applicants had deliberately failed to comply with the warrants for their arrest, since they had not attended the hearing for the delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the date of which had been duly notified to them. They had lodged their appeal on points of law three days later, and could therefore not maintain that, not having been served in person with a copy of the arrest warrant, they were not obliged to comply with it. The ruling that the appeal was inadmissible had thus been proportionate to the aim pursued, which was to make it possible to enforce the court’s order against the applicants, regard being had in addition to the level of the court which had ruled it inadmissible. Moreover, unlike Mr Poitrimol, the applicants had had the benefit of adversarial procedure at first instance and on appeal, so that the Court’s conclusion in the Poitrimol v. France judgment (23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A) could not be transposed to the present case. Lastly, scrutiny of the criminal proceedings against the applicants as a whole showed that their right to a fair trial had been respected."

The Commission considered that there was no direct or relevant connection between the obligation for a convicted person to surrender to custody at a prison before his appeal on points of law is considered and his right of access to a court or his exercise of his rights of defence. It also expressed the opinion that the Court’s decision in the Poitrimol case was valid not only in respect of cases where a defendant had unsuccessfully sought on appeal to justify his refusal to appear before the court and to be represented by counsel; it had to do with the disproportionate nature of the sanction as such. In the present case the sanction was all the more disproportionate because, unlike Mr Poitrimol, who had left French territory, the applicants had not absconded and had never at any time attempted to evade justice."

However, these limitations must not restrict exercise of the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.

It could not be otherwise unless he supplied evidence of circumstances making it absolutely impossible for him to surrender to custody at the appropriate time. As no such evidence has been supplied by the three appellants, against whom arrest warrants were issued after they had appeared in court for the hearing, their appeal, which has been lodged by an attorney practising in the Court of Appeal, must be declared inadmissible” (see paragraph 16 above)."

Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6” (see the Delcourt v.

The Court is therefore of the view that, to that limited but crucial extent, the relevant procedural framework available under Polish law as from February 2002 was deficient in the applicant ’ s case. The failure of the Katowice Court of Appeal to inform the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, of his procedural rights meant that he had no way of knowing that he had a new time-frame within which to find a lawyer who might be persuaded to file a cassation appeal on his behalf. The Court notes in this connection that the procedural framework governing the making available of legal aid for a cassation appeal in criminal cases, as described above, is within the control of the appellate courts. When notified of a legal-aid lawyer ’ s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with fairness requirements, that an appeal court indicate to an appellant what further procedural options are available to him or her. The Supreme Court ’ s case-law stresses this point. However, in the instant case this requirement was not complied with, with the result that the applicant ’ s right of access to the Supreme Court was not secured in a “concrete and effective manner”."

Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights. It was the lawyer ’ s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so, there was no legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment, or oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case."

In its decision of 25 March 1998 the Supreme Court stated that the refusal of a legal ‑ aid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time (V KZ 12/98). It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99)."

It examined a particular situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer ’ s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with the legal-aid lawyer ’ s refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time-limit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable time-frame (II KZ 16/08).",

It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, p. 24, § 57; Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.

However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with. The manner in which this provision applies to courts of appeal or of cassation depends on the special features of the proceedings concerned and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and the court of cassation ’ s role in them. Given the special nature of the court of cassation ’ s role, which is limited to reviewing whether the law has been correctly applied, the Court is able to accept that the procedure followed in such courts may be more formal ( see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, § 41, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Staroszczyk v. Poland, cited above, § 25 and Siałkowska v. Poland, cited above, § 104). However, the Court must satisfy itself that the method chosen by the domestic authorities in a particular case is compatible with the Convention. (see, mutatis mutandis, Artico, cited above, § 33; Goddi v. Italy, judgment of 9 April 1984, Series A no. 76, p. 11, § 27; Rutkowski, cited above; Staroszczyk v.

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the Polish law of criminal procedure requires that a person whose conviction has been upheld by an appellate court should be assisted by a lawyer in the preparation of his or her cassation appeal against a judgment given by that court. The Court reiterates that the requirement that an appellant be represented by a qualified lawyer before a court of cassation cannot, in itself, be seen as contrary to Article 6. This requirement is clearly compatible with the characteristics of the Supreme Court as the highest court in Poland examining appeals on points of law and it is a common feature of the legal systems in several member States of the Council of Europe ( see Vacher v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996- VI, pp. 2148-49, §§ 24 and 28; Staroszczyk v. Poland, cited above, § 128 )."

The lawyer subsequently advised the court, by a letter dated 20 March 2003 that, in her view, a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court did not offer reasonable prospects of success."

The Court notes that the Polish Supreme Court, in its decision of 17 June 1997, stated that the role of a legal ‑ aid lawyer had to be understood as obliging him or her to provide comprehensive legal advice to the party, including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal in a given individual case. It concluded that it was permissible for a legal - aid lawyer assigned to a criminal case to refuse to prepare and lodge a cassation appeal and reiterated this conclusion in its subsequent case-law (see paragraphs 23 –26 above). From the standpoint of Article 6 of the Convention and bearing in mind the nature of a cassation appeal in the context of criminal proceedings, the Court cannot but endorse this conclusion (see Staroszczyk v. Poland, cited above, § 113, mutatis mutandis )."

In this connection, the Court emphasises that it is the responsibility of the State to ensure the requisite balance between, on the one hand, effective enjoyment of access to justice and the independence of the legal profession on the other ( see Siałkowska v. Poland, cited above, § 112; Staroszczyk v. Poland, cited above, § 133 ). The mere fact that a legal- ‑ aid lawyer can refuse to represent a defendant in proceedings before the highest court cannot be said to be, of itself, tantamount to a denial of legal assistance which is incompatible with the State ’ s obligations under Article 6 of the Convention."

The Court further reiterates that although admissibility conditions for appeals are necessary to ensure legal certainty and a proper administration of justice and litigants should normally expect those rules to be applied, a particularly strict interpretation of a procedural rule may deprive an applicant of the right of access to a court (see Běleš and others v. Czech Republic, no. 47273/99, § 60, 12 November 2002; Zvolský and Zvolská v. Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, 12 November 2002; Kemp and Others v.

In this connection, the Court notes that the Supreme Court in a series of decisions noted the difficulties which could arise for the defendant in securing an effective access to the cassation court where the grant of legal aid for the purposes of cassation proceedings had been made but the legal ‑ aid lawyer subsequently concluded that a cassation appeal offered no prospects of success. The Supreme Court has examined the manner in which the beginning of the relevant time-limit should be determined in such special circumstances. It held, in its decision of 26 February 2002, that following a legal ‑ aid lawyer ’ s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal the event triggering the running of the relevant time-limit should be established in such a way as to accommodate the defendant ’ s situation so as not to deprive him of a practical possibility of having his or her case examined by the Supreme Court. Hence, it held that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was informed of the lawyer ’ s refusal, not when the lawyer was served with the judgment of the second-instance court."

In the present case the applicant was served with the lawyer ’ s refusal on 1 April 2003 and in the light of the case ‑ law of the Supreme Court referred to above the thirty-day time-limit started to run on that date. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was put in a position where he was left with so little time to have a cassation appeal prepared that he was denied a realistic opportunity of having her case brought to and argued before the cassation court (compare and contrast with Siałkowska v. Poland, no. 8932/05, §§ 11 4 - 1 1 5, 22 March 2007, where the time ‑ limit started to run when the legal-aid lawyer was served with the judgment and the applicant was informed of the lawyer ’ s refusal only three days before the expiry of the time ‑ limit). It has not been shown or argued that in these circumstances it would have been impossible for the applicant to find a new lawyer to represent him."

                "68. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant had been found eligible for assistance by a legal ‑ aid lawyer. The court thereby acknowledged that he could not bear the costs of a privately hired lawyer (see paragraphs 1 1 and 14 above). The Court is aware that under the case ‑ law of the Supreme Court the mere refusal of a legal ‑ aid lawyer to prepare a cassation appeal did not constitute a sufficient ground for a new lawyer to be assigned to the case under the legal ‑ aid scheme (see paragraphs 23 – 2 4 and 26 above). However, the Court is of the view that Article 6 of the Convention does not confer on the State an obligation to ensure assistance by successive legal ‑ aid lawyers for the purposes of pursuing legal remedies which have already been found not to offer reasonable prospects of success. In the present case the first lawyer appointed under the legal ‑ aid scheme found no legal grounds on which to prepare a cassation appeal. In the absence of indications of negligence or arbitrariness on the lawyer ’ s part in discharging her duties, the State can be said to have complied with its obligations to provide effective legal aid to the applicant in connection with the cassation proceedings."

                "69. However, the Court further notes that under the case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 27 above) the Katowice Court of Appeal was obliged to instruct the applicant that the time ‑ limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date when he was served with the lawyer ’ s refusal. The court failed to comply with that obligation."
            ],
            [
                "70. The Court is therefore of the view that, to that limited but crucial extent, the relevant procedural framework available under Polish law as from February 2002 was deficient in the applicant ’ s case. The failure of the Katowice Court of Appeal to inform the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, of his procedural rights meant that he had no way of knowing that he had a new time-frame within which to find a lawyer who might be persuaded to file a cassation appeal on his behalf. The Court notes in this connection that the procedural framework governing the making available of legal aid for a cassation appeal in criminal cases, as described above, is within the control of the appellate courts. When notified of a legal-aid lawyer ’ s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with fairness requirements, that an appeal court indicate to an appellant what further procedural options are available to him or her. The Supreme Court ’ s case-law stresses this point. However, in the instant case this requirement was not complied with, with the result that the applicant ’ s right of access to the Supreme Court was not secured in a “concrete and effective manner”."

He submitted that under the applicable provisions of Polish law it was for the parent or legal guardian to decide whether their minor child could testify in court. In the applicant ’ s case he had never been given an opportunity to give his opinion on that matter. It had simply been assumed that his sons should be interviewed by the prosecuting authorities, despite the fact that the applicant had had full parental powers. The law did not provide for any mechanism by which the interests of a parent charged with a criminal offence could be reconciled with the need to conduct criminal proceedings against him by interviewing his children as witnesses. The applicant concluded that the restrictions on his contacts with his sons had therefore been unlawful and unjustified."

                "74. The Court reiterates that detention, like any other measure depriving a person of his liberty, entails inherent limitations on private and family life. Such restrictions as limitations on the number of family visits, supervision of those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special arrangements for visits constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision ( see Kucera v. Slovakia, no. 48666/99, §§ 127-128, 17 July 2007 and Lorsé and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, § 72). However, it is an essential part of a detainee ’ s right to respect for family life that the authorities enable him or, if need be, assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see, mutatis mutandis, Messina v. Italy (no. 2) no. 25498/94, § 6 1, 28 September 2000 )."

Any restriction of that kind must be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more legitimate aims listed in paragraph 2 and, in addition, must be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society”. As to the latter criterion, the Court would further reiterate that the notion of “necessity” for the purposes of Article 8 means that the interference must correspond to a pressing social need, and, in particular, must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. When assessing whether an interference was “necessary” the Court will take into account the margin of appreciation left to the State authorities but it is a duty of the respondent State to demonstrate the existence of the pressing social need motivating the interference (see, among other authorities, McLeod v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2791, § 52; Płoski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, § 35, 12 November 2002; and Baginski v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 89, 11 October 2005)."

The contested measures were applied under Article 217 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences. It consequently holds that the interference was “in accordance with the law”. The Court notes that the limitations on the applicant ’ s contact with his family and on his correspondence with them were imposed on the grounds that they had been witnesses in the proceedings against him (see paragraph 10 above). The impugned measure can accordingly be considered as having been taken in pursuance of “the prevention of disorder and crime”, which is a legitimate aim under Article 8. It remains for the Court to ascertain whether the authorities struck a fair balance between the need to secure the process of obtaining evidence in the applicant ’ s case and his right to respect for his family life while in detention."
            ],
            [
                "77. The Court notes that no information was submitted by the applicant as to the exact scope of the restrictions imposed on his contacts and correspondence with his family. In particular, it has not been shown when the relevant decisions were given by the domestic authorities and on what grounds they held that the restrictions were justified. Nor did the applicant specify the periods during which these restrictions remained in force. In the absence of detailed factual submissions in support of this complaint, it is impossible for the Court to examine, in particular, whether the authorities considered any alternative means of ensuring that the applicant ’ s contact with his children would not obstruct the process of taking evidence. Such alternative restrictions could entail, for example, supervision of their visits by a prison officer or possibly also other restrictions on the nature, frequency and duration of contact (see Klamecki (no.2) v. Poland, no. 31583/96, § 151, 3 April 2003). In this context the Court notes that it is reasonable to assume that different restrictions were called for during the investigation and, later on, when the proceedings entered their judicial stage. However, an examination of the restrictions imposed on the applicant ’ s contacts and correspondence with his family from the angle of their proportionality with the legitimate aim sought would only have been possible had the applicant made sufficiently detailed submissions as to the facts. In the light of the information before it the Court considers that it has not been shown that the measures complained of went beyond what was necessary in a democratic society “to prevent disorder and crime” in the context of family visits in prison during pre-trial detention and an on-going criminal investigation."

These circumstances gave serious cause to doubt the independence of the tribunal from the prosecuting authority.

Such rules manifest the national legislature's concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Accordingly, a failure to abide by these rules means that the case has been heard by a tribunal whose impartiality was recognised by national law to be open to doubt. Provided they are not based on arbitrary assumptions, the Court will take such rules into account when making its own assessment whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant's fears can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, Pescador Valero v.

The mere fact that he had previously been involved in the applicant's case did not, in itself, violate Article 6. That circumstance had not influenced his impartiality because he had represented the plaintiffs for just two months almost nine years before the Constitutional Court had been called on to decide the applicant's case. Furthermore, during the period when he represented the applicant's opponents, no significant decision was taken.

                "27. The Court notes that the existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, is a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature's concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Accordingly, a failure to abide by these rules means that the case has been heard by a tribunal whose impartiality was recognised by national law to be open to doubt. Provided they are not based on arbitrary assumptions, the Court will take such rules into account when making its own assessment whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant's fears can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, Pescador Valero v. Spain, no. 62435/00, §§ 24-29, ECHR 2003 ‑ VII; Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 227, p. 16, § 36; and Oberschlick v.

Even if it might be argued that the specific provisions on the withdrawal are not particularly clear and precise, the Court points out that its task is not to review the relevant domestic law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to or affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of Article 6 § 1 in the present case (see, inter alia, Padovani v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257 ‑ B, p. 20, § 24; and Hauschildt v. Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 45 )."

Austria, judgment of 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255, p. 12, §§ 27, 28 and 30; Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 42, ECHR 2000-XII).

This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein v. Switzerland, cited above, § 44; and Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

Belgium (judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, pp. 14-16, §§ 30-31) the fact that a judge had presided over a criminal trial after having been the head of the public prosecutor's office in charge of the prosecution in the case was capable of making the tribunal's impartiality open to doubt, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In Wettstein (cited above, § 47) there was an overlapping in time of two sets of proceedings in which R. exercised the function of judge in one case, and that of legal representative of the party opposing the applicant in the other. As a result, the applicant had reason for concern that Judge R. would continue to see him as the opposing party. The Court concluded that this situation could have raised legitimate fears in the applicant that Judge R. was not approaching the case with the requisite impartiality. Further, in Walston v. Norway ( (dec.), no. 37372/97, 11 December 2001 ) the time-frame was regarded as relevant when assessing the significance of a judge's previous relationship to the opposing party."

Under that provision all letters from a person detained on remand to a private individual had to be stopped if they gave rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence subject to public prosecution ex officio (von Amts wegen ).

Such an offence, if committed against an official in the exercise of his duty, required public prosecution with the victim ’ s authorisation (Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 26 below). In the present case, the offence resulted from the handing over by Mrs Plankl of an unsealed letter to a prison officer for the purpose of transmitting it to the investigating judge. It had thus been possible for the letter ’ s content to become known to several prison or court officers in the exercise of their duty.

In addition, as the Government conceded, there is no provision of Austrian law which allows for a defendant expressly to waive his right to be tried by a court whose composition is in accordance with the law, nor consequently is there any provision which defines the procedure to be followed for this purpose.

Under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is determinant is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid., para. 51).",

Although this statement referred to systems like the Danish, where investigation and prosecution are exclusively the domain of the police and the prosecution, it must also be of some relevance to systems of an inquisitorial character, such as the Austrian.

Although a District Court judge could only carry out preliminary inquiries, such inquiries could in fact be just as extensive as formal preliminary investigations conducted by an investigating judge. Moreover, the former was vested with powers to order detention on remand which were similar to, albeit more limited than, those of the latter. What is more, a District Court judge had a \"suspiciously close relationship\" with a public prosecutor. For instance, whilst an investigating judge had to send the case back to the prosecutor once the investigations had been completed, a District Court judge might himself set the case down for trial at that stage; if he did so, this provided a clear indication of a belief on his part that there was a likelihood that the accused was guilty.",

He shared the Commission ’ s view that they were measures that were typical of an investigating judge. They had been aimed at establishing whether the applicant had fraudulently obtained money from the landlady, Mrs Kröll, yet this was precisely the issue to be determined at his trial (see paragraph 13 above). Judge Kohlegger had thus acquired, before the trial, a particularly detailed knowledge of the file. By having previously acted as an investigating judge in the case, she had also, according to the applicant, formed an opinion on the case before she set it down for trial."

Under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is determinant is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid., para. 51).",

Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 22, para. 50). Although this statement referred to systems like the Danish, where investigation and prosecution are exclusively the domain of the police and the prosecution, it must also be of some relevance to systems of an inquisitorial character, such as the Austrian.

Judge Kohlegger carried out this task and sent the investigating judge a report of the interrogation of Mrs Kröll, which consisted in essence solely of making a record of the statements made by her. In the limited capacity in which she acted it was not for Judge Kohlegger to examine the merits of the accusations against the applicant, nor does it appear from the case-file that she actually did so, and there is no indication that at the time when the questioning took place there was any prospect of Judge Kohlegger later trying the case."

That decision merely gave effect to the rule, under the applicable law, that the hearing date should be fixed as soon as such preliminary inquiries as may be necessary have been made (see paragraph 19 above). It cannot be regarded as the equivalent of a formal decision to commit an accused for trial, a step which was not provided for in proceedings, such as the present, instituted simply on an application by a public prosecutor to a District Court for the imposition of a penalty (see paragraph 18 above)."

It does not appear that the various measures which she had taken prior to the trial were such as could have led her to reach a preconceived view on the merits.

The Government put forward a series of arguments to show that this combination of functions, which was unquestionably compatible with the Judicial Code as construed in the light of its drafting history (see paragraph 20, first sub-paragraph, above), was also reconcilable with the Convention. They pointed out that in Belgium an investigating judge is fully independent in the performance of his duties; that unlike the judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department, whose submissions are not binding on him, he does not have the status of a party to criminal proceedings and is not \"an instrument of the prosecution\"; that \"the object of his activity\" is not, despite Mr. De Cubber ’ s allegations, \"to establish the guilt of the person he believes to be guilty\" (see paragraph 44 of the Commission ’ s report), but to \"assemble in an impartial manner evidence in favour of as well as against the accused\", whilst maintaining \"a just balance between prosecution and defence\", since he \"never ceases to be a judge\"; that he does not take the decision whether to commit the accused for trial - he merely presents to the chambre du conseil, of which he is not a member, objective reports describing the progress and state of the preliminary investigations, without expressing any opinion of his own, even assuming he has formed one (see paragraphs 52-54 of the Commission ’ s report and the verbatim record of the hearings held on 23 May 1984)."

This reasoning no doubt reflects several aspects of the reality of the situation (see paragraphs 15, first sub-paragraph, 17 in fine and 18 above) and the Court recognises its cogency. Nonetheless, it is not in itself decisive and there are various other factors telling in favour of the opposite conclusion.",
                "To begin with, a close examination of the statutory texts shows the distinction between judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department and investigating judges to be less clear-cut than initially appears. An investigating judge, like\" procureurs du Roi and their deputies\", has the status of officer of the criminal investigation police and, as such, is \"placed under the supervision of the procureur général \"; furthermore, \"an investigating judge\" may, in cases \"where the suspected offender is deemed to have been caught in the act\", \"take directly\" and in person \"any action which the procureur du Roi is empowered to take\" (see paragraph 15, second sub-paragraph, above).",
                "In addition to this, as an investigating judge he has very wide-ranging powers: he can \"take any steps which are not forbidden by law or incompatible with the standing of his office\" (see paragraph 17 above). Save as regards the warrant of arrest issued against the applicant on 5 April 1977, the Court has only limited information as to the measures taken by Mr. Pilate in the circumstances, but, to judge by the complexity of the case and the duration of the preparatory investigation, they must have been quite extensive (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above).",
                "That is not all. Under Belgian law the preparatory investigation, which is inquisitorial in nature, is secret and is not conducted in the presence of both parties; in this respect it differs from the procedure of investigation followed at the hearing before the trial court, which, in the instant case, took place on 8 and 22 June 1979 before the Oudenaarde court (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). One can accordingly understand that an accused might feel some unease should he see on the bench of the court called upon to determine the charge against him the judge who had ordered him to be placed in detention on remand and who had interrogated him on numerous occasions during the preparatory investigation, albeit with questions dictated by a concern to ascertain the truth.",
                "Furthermore, through the various means of inquiry which he will have utilised at the investigation stage, the judge in question, unlike his colleagues, will already have acquired well before the hearing a particularly detailed knowledge of the - sometimes voluminous - file or files which he has assembled. Consequently, it is quite conceivable that he might, in the eyes of the accused, appear, firstly, to be in a position enabling him to play a crucial role in the trial court and, secondly, even to have a pre-formed opinion which is liable to weigh heavily in the balance at the moment of the decision. In addition, the criminal court (tribunal correctionnel ) may, like the court of appeal (see paragraph 19 in fine above), have to review the lawfulness of measures taken or ordered by the investigating judge. The accused may view with some alarm the prospect of the investigating judge being actively involved in this process of review.",
                "Finally, the Court notes that a judicial officer who has \"acted in the case as investigating judge\" may not, under the terms of Article 127 of the Judicial Code, preside over or participate as judge in proceedings before an assize court; nor, as the Court of Cassation has held, may he sit as an appeal-court judge (see paragraph 19 above). Belgian law-makers and case-law have thereby manifested their concern to make assize courts and appeal courts free of any legitimate suspicion of partiality.

Without underestimating the force of the Government ’ s arguments and without adopting a subjective approach (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above), the Court recalls that a restrictive interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) - notably in regard to observance of the fundamental principle of the impartiality of the courts - would not be consonant with the object and purpose of the provision, bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial holds in a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, para. 25 in fine).",

This reasoning no doubt reflects several aspects of the reality of the situation (see paragraphs 15, first sub-paragraph, 17 in fine and 18 above) and the Court recognises its cogency. Nonetheless, it is not in itself decisive and there are various other factors telling in favour of the opposite conclusion.",
                "To begin with, a close examination of the statutory texts shows the distinction between judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department and investigating judges to be less clear-cut than initially appears. An investigating judge, like\" procureurs du Roi and their deputies\", has the status of officer of the criminal investigation police and, as such, is \"placed under the supervision of the procureur général \"; furthermore, \"an investigating judge\" may, in cases \"where the suspected offender is deemed to have been caught in the act\", \"take directly\" and in person \"any action which the procureur du Roi is empowered to take\" (see paragraph 15, second sub-paragraph, above).",
                "In addition to this, as an investigating judge he has very wide-ranging powers: he can \"take any steps which are not forbidden by law or incompatible with the standing of his office\" (see paragraph 17 above). Save as regards the warrant of arrest issued against the applicant on 5 April 1977, the Court has only limited information as to the measures taken by Mr. Pilate in the circumstances, but, to judge by the complexity of the case and the duration of the preparatory investigation, they must have been quite extensive (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above).",
                "That is not all. Under Belgian law the preparatory investigation, which is inquisitorial in nature, is secret and is not conducted in the presence of both parties; in this respect it differs from the procedure of investigation followed at the hearing before the trial court, which, in the instant case, took place on 8 and 22 June 1979 before the Oudenaarde court (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). One can accordingly understand that an accused might feel some unease should he see on the bench of the court called upon to determine the charge against him the judge who had ordered him to be placed in detention on remand and who had interrogated him on numerous occasions during the preparatory investigation, albeit with questions dictated by a concern to ascertain the truth.",
                "Furthermore, through the various means of inquiry which he will have utilised at the investigation stage, the judge in question, unlike his colleagues, will already have acquired well before the hearing a particularly detailed knowledge of the - sometimes voluminous - file or files which he has assembled. Consequently, it is quite conceivable that he might, in the eyes of the accused, appear, firstly, to be in a position enabling him to play a crucial role in the trial court and, secondly, even to have a pre-formed opinion which is liable to weigh heavily in the balance at the moment of the decision. In addition, the criminal court (tribunal correctionnel ) may, like the court of appeal (see paragraph 19 in fine above), have to review the lawfulness of measures taken or ordered by the investigating judge. The accused may view with some alarm the prospect of the investigating judge being actively involved in this process of review.",
                "Finally, the Court notes that a judicial officer who has \"acted in the case as investigating judge\" may not, under the terms of Article 127 of the Judicial Code, preside over or participate as judge in proceedings before an assize court; nor, as the Court of Cassation has held, may he sit as an appeal-court judge (see paragraph 19 above).

Without underestimating the force of the Government ’ s arguments and without adopting a subjective approach (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above), the Court recalls that a restrictive interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) - notably in regard to observance of the fundamental principle of the impartiality of the courts - would not be consonant with the object and purpose of the provision, bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial holds in a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, para. 25 in fine).",

Demands of flexibility and efficiency, which are fully compatible with the protection of human rights, may justify the prior intervention of administrative or professional bodies and, a fortiori, of judicial bodies which do not satisfy the said requirements in every respect; the legal tradition of many member States of the Council of Europe may be invoked in support of such a system.\" (Series A no. 43, pp. 22-23, paras. 50-51)",

Even in instances where Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable, conferring powers in this manner does not in itself infringe the Convention.... Nonetheless, in such circumstances the Convention calls at least for one of the two following systems: either the jurisdictional organs themselves comply with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or they do not so comply but are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" - that is to say, which has the competence to furnish \"a [judicial] determination ... of the matters in dispute, both for questions of fact and for questions of law\" - \"and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\" (Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29)",

As confirmation of this, the Government cited the Oztürk judgment of 21 February 1984 (Series A no. 73, pp. 21-22, para. 56) in addition to the above-mentioned judgments of 23 June 1981 and 10 February 1983 (Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53, and Series A no. 58, pp. 16-17, para. 30).",
                "In the particular circumstances, the Government noted, Mr. De Cubber ’ s complaint was directed solely against the Oudenaarde court; he had no objection to make concerning the Ghent Court of Appeal, which in the present case, so they argued, constituted the \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\", as referred to in the above-quoted case-law.",
                "On the whole of this issue, the Government cited the Blaise judgment of 4 April 1984, which the Belgian Court of Cassation had delivered in a similar case, and the concordant submissions of the public prosecutor ’ s department in that case (see paragraph 20 above)."

                "The thrust of the plea summarised above is that the proceedings before the Oudenaarde court fell outside the ambit of 1Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). At first sight, this plea contains an element of paradox. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) concerns primarily courts of first instance; it does not require the existence of courts of further instance. It is true that its fundamental guarantees, including impartiality, must also be provided by any courts of appeal or courts of cassation which a Contracting State may have chosen to set up (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, Series A no. 11, p. 14 in fine, and, as the most recent authority, the Sutter judgment of 22 February 1984, Series A no. 74, p. 13, para. 28). However, even when this is the case it does not follow that the lower courts do not have to provide the required guarantees. Such a result would be at variance with the intention underlying the creation of several levels of courts, namely to reinforce the protection afforded to litigants.",
                "Furthermore, the case-law relied on by the Government has to be viewed in its proper context. The judgments of 23 June 1981, 10 February 1983 and 21 February 1984 concerned litigation which was classified by the domestic law of the respondent State not as civil or criminal but as disciplinary (Series A no. 43, p. 9, para. 11) or administrative (Series A no. 73, pp. 10-14, paras. 17-33); these judgments related to bodies which, within the national system, were not regarded as courts of the classic kind, for the reason that they were not integrated within the standard judicial machinery of the country. The Court would not have held Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applicable had it not been for the \"autonomy\" of the concepts of \"civil rights and obligations\" and \"criminal charge\". In the present case, on the other hand, what was involved was a trial which not only the Convention but also Belgian law classified as criminal; the Oudenaarde criminal court was neither an administrative or professional authority, nor a jurisdictional organ of a professional association (see the above-mentioned judgments, Series A no. 43, p. 23, para. 51, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29, and Series A no. 73, pp. 21-22, para. 56), but a proper court in both the formal and the substantive meaning of the term (Decisions and Reports, no. 15, p. 78, paras. 59-60, and p. 87: opinion of the Commission and decision of the Committee of Ministers on application no. 7360/76, Zand v. Austria). The reasoning adopted in the three above-mentioned judgments, to which should be added the Campbell and Fell judgment of 28 June 1984 (Series A no. 80, pp. 34-39, paras. 67-73 and 76), cannot justify reducing the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in its traditional and natural sphere of application. A restrictive interpretation of this kind would not be consonant with the object and purpose of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraph 30 in fine above)."

At the hearings, the Commission ’ s Delegate and the applicant ’ s lawyer raised a further question, concerning not the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) but rather its application to the particular facts: had not \"the subsequent intervention\" of the Ghent Court of Appeal \"made good the wrong\" or \"purged\" the first-instance proceedings of the \"defect\" that vitiated them?",

Thus, the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982 noted that the Austrian Supreme Court had \"cleared ... of any finding of guilt\" an applicant in respect of whom a District Court had not respected the principle of presumption of innocence laid down by Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2) (Series A no. 49, pp. 17-19, paras. 38-41).",
                "The circumstances of the present case, however, were different. The particular defect in question did not bear solely upon the conduct of the first-instance proceedings: its source being the very composition of the Oudenaarde criminal court, the defect involved matters of internal organisation and the Court of Appeal did not cure that defect since it did not quash on that ground the judgment of 29 June 1979 in its entirety.",

In the further alternative, the Government pleaded that a finding by the Court of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would entail serious consequences for Belgian courts with \"limited staff\", especially if it were to give a judgment \"on the general question of principle\" rather than a judgment \"with reasoning limited to the very special\" facts of the case. In this connection, the Government drew attention to the following matters. From 1970 to 1984, the workload of such courts had more than doubled, whereas there had been no increase in the number of judges. At Oudenaarde and at Nivelles, for example, taking account of vacant posts (deaths, resignations, promotions) and occasional absences (holidays, illness, etc.), there were only six or seven judges permanently in attendance, all of whom were \"very busy\", if not overwhelmed with work. Accordingly, it was virtually inevitable that one of the judges had to deal in turn with different aspects of the same case. To avoid this, it would be necessary either to constitute \"special benches\" - which would be liable to occasion delays incompatible with the principle of trial \"within a reasonable time\" - or to create additional posts, an alternative that was scarcely realistic in times of budgetary stringency."

The Court ’ s task is to determine whether the Contracting States have achieved the result called for by the Convention, not to indicate the particular means to be utilised."

Whether the applicant ’ s involvement with C3 and D fulfilled all the relevant criteria necessary to constitute a criminal offence and, if so, whether the applicant was guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, of having committed such an offence was not addressed, determined or assessed by the trial judges whose impartiality the applicant now wishes to challenge. There is no specific qualification of the involvement of the applicant or of acts committed by him, criminal or otherwise. In this the facts of the applicant ’ s case differ from those of Ferrantelli and Santangelo and Rojas Morales.

In the first place, the judgment of 2 June 1988 of the Caltanisetta Assize Court of Appeal, presided over by Judge S.P. (see paragraph 26 above) contained numerous references to the applicants and their respective roles in the attack on the barracks. In particular, mention was made of the \"co-perpetrators\" of the double crime and of \"the precise statement by G.V. that G.G. together with Santangelo had been responsible for physically carrying out the murders\", and it was affirmed that Mr Ferrantelli had helped to search the barracks and to transport material belonging to the carabinieri. Secondly, the judgment of the Juvenile Section of the Caltanisetta Court of Appeal of 6 April 1991 (see paragraph 30 above) convicting the applicants cited numerous extracts from the decision of the Assize Court of Appeal concerning G.G.

They asked the Court to take note of the changes to the court-martial system to be effected by the Armed Forces Act 1996 which, in their submission, more than satisfactorily met the Commission ’ s concerns."

He also acted as confirming officer, and the court martial ’ s findings had no effect until confirmed by him. These circumstances gave serious cause to doubt the independence of the tribunal from the prosecuting authority. The judge advocate ’ s involvement was not sufficient to dispel this doubt, since he was not a member of the court martial, did not take part in its deliberations and gave his advice on sentencing in private. In addition, it noted that Mr Findlay ’ s court-martial board contained no judicial members, no legally qualified members and no civilians, that it was set up on an ad hoc basis and that the convening officer had the power to dissolve it either before or during the trial. The requirement to take an oath was not a sufficient guarantee of independence.",

This defect was not, moreover, remedied by any subsequent review by a judicial body affording all the guarantees required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since the confirming officer was the same person as the convening officer, and the reviewing authorities were army officers, the second of whom was superior in rank to the first.

The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay ’ s case. He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate. He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).",
                "Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those \"reasonably requested\" by the defence. His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).",

It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above)."

This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of \"tribunal\" and can also be seen as a component of the \"independence\" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45)."

It is true that to a certain extent Mr Bandion stepped outside the duties attaching to his function by dealing in his report with matters relating to the assessment of evidence, but this does not warrant the conclusion that the position which he occupied in the proceedings under review was that of a witness for the prosecution either.",

The Inspector had emptied the remaining bottles only after the applicant had protested. The applicant ’ s wife and two sons, who were called as witnesses, confirmed his statements.",

The scientific findings corresponded to the conclusions of the quality control panels which had identified the addition of water in all the samples except one. As with the results of the tasting, they revealed the prohibited addition of water and sugar, and a level of natural extracts and substances below that required by the Wine Ordinance. The applicant ’ s products could not, however, be classified as \"imitation wine\". Various statements by Mr Brandstetter and members of his family during the hearing (see paragraph 15 above) must have been wrong in view of the results of the chemical analysis, in particular statements concerning the use of a dirty bucket by the Inspector of Cellars.

In addition, the expert had exceeded his duties by expressing a view on questions of fact and of law instead of merely carrying out a chemical analysis. Consequently, the defence requested further investigative measures, namely the drawing of new samples from the two tanks which had been seized, the taking of evidence from several other experts, including Mr Niessner, and the consultation of the minutes of the quality control panel. The defence also alleged that the rules laid down for a tasting had not been complied with.

The appeal court regarded it as decisive that the bottles, irrespective of whether they had been rinsed with water or wine, could not contain a significant quantity of liquid once they had been emptied in the way described in a credible and convincing manner by the Inspector of Cellars."

In this regard the present case differs from the Bönisch case.",

The defence stressed the similarities between the results of Mr Flack and those of Mr Niessner. Taking them as its starting point, the defence followed the line of reasoning that (1) it could be proved that the seals on the bottles containing the counter-samples were untouched when Mr Niessner started their analysis; (2) accordingly, the counter-samples could not have been tampered with; and (3) it followed that Mr Niessner had analysed the same wine as the Agricultural Institute and that the analyses of that Institute must have been wrong. In order to prove these allegations the defence requested that Mr Niessner should be heard, both as a witness and as an expert (paragraph 26 above).",
                "The first request was granted but the second rejected, and, at the second hearing, Mr Niessner was heard merely as a witness (see paragraph 26 above). As such he could only answer questions put to him by the judge, the public prosecutor and the defence. The questions that were actually put to him concerned solely the question whether it could indeed be ruled out that the counter-samples had been tampered with before he started his analysis. No one, not even the defence, asked questions with regard to the methods he had employed or the results that he had obtained.",
                "It is true that Mr Niessner was not heard \"under the same conditions\" as Mr Flack, yet in the light of the way argument was presented it cannot be said that the refusal to appoint Mr Niessner as an expert amounted to a breach of the principle of equality of arms. The line taken by the defence implied that the results of Mr Niessner ’ s analysis were only relevant if it could be proved that the counter-samples had not, and could not have been, tampered with. On the latter issue Mr Flack had not written or said anything, while the defence had been able to put all the questions it wished to the only witness it had called on this point. Since the court found that it had not been established that tampering with the counter-samples could be excluded, the ground for the request to appoint Mr Niessner as a second expert ceased to exist."

The Government ’ s argument is not that these submissions are prescribed by law so that the applicant should have known that they were to be filed; their argument seems to be that the submissions - the so-called \"croquis\" (see paragraph 34 above) - were filed according to a standing practice which enables the Senior Public Prosecutor to file such a croquis in such cases as he deems appropriate. They suggest that this practice must have been known to the applicant ’ s lawyer who, accordingly, could have enquired whether in the applicant ’ s case a croquis had been filed. If so, he could have requested leave to inspect the file under section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and thus could have commented on it. Section 82, as it is formulated, however, does not seem to grant an unconditional right to inspect the complete file but only the possibility to ask for leave to do so, and the parties differ as to whether, with regard to the croquis, such leave would have been granted at the relevant time. The Commission left that question unsettled and so will the Court.",

Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or decommunisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process.

Given the social importance of the lustration proceedings and severe consequences for an individual who had made an untrue declaration, the principles of the rule of law and procedural guarantees for the lustrated person must be scrupulously observed. In the light of the principles embodied in Article 6 of the Convention, which was obviously applicable to lustration proceedings, they should comply with the following standards: impartial and independent tribunal, reasonable time, presumption of innocence, giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt, public hearings, access to the files and possibility of making notes."

In particular the Court held in that case that, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities of contradicting the security agency's version of the facts will be severely curtailed.",

Turning to the instant case, the Court observes firstly that the Government have pointed to the series of successive laws on the basis of which the communist-era security services'materials continued to be regarded as a State secret (see paragraph 47 above). The confidential status of such materials had been upheld by the State Security Bureau. Thus, at least part of the documents relating to the applicant's lustration case had been classified as “top secret”. The Head of the State Security Bureau was also empowered to lift the confidentiality rating, which, with respect to some materials relating to the applicant's case, took place in December 2000. The Court observes that it has considered the existence of a similar power of a State security agency inconsistent with the fairness of lustration proceedings, including with the principle of equality of arms (see Turek, cited above, § 115)."

However, pursuant to Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 52 (2) of the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act, no copies could be made of materials contained in the court file and confidential documents could be consulted only in the secret registry of the lustration court (see paragraphs 36, 38 and 48 above).",

The notebooks could not be removed from this registry and could be opened only by the person who had made them. Similarly, the notes taken during the hearings, the great majority of which were held in camera, were to be made in special notebooks which were later kept in the court's secret registry.

Under section 17(e) of the Lustration Act, the Commissioner of the Public Interest had a right of access to full documentation relating to the lustrated person created by, inter alia, the former security services. If necessary, he could hear witnesses and order expert opinions. The Commissioner also had at his disposal a secret registry with staff who obtained official clearance allowing them access to documents considered to be State secrets and were employed to analyse lustration declarations in the light of the existing documents and to prepare the case file for the lustration trial (see paragraphs 30 and 3 1 above)."

                "62. The Court recognises that at the end of the 1990s the State had an interest in carrying out lustration in respect of persons holding the most important public functions. However, it reiterates that if a State is to adopt lustration measures, it must ensure that the persons affected thereby enjoy all procedural guarantees under the Convention in respect of any proceedings relating to the application of such measures (see Turek, cited above, § 115). The Court accepts that there may be a situation in which there is a compelling State interest in maintaining secrecy of some documents, even those produced under the former regime. Nevertheless, such a situation will only arise exceptionally given the considerable time that has elapsed since the documents were created. It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case because what is accepted as an exception must not become a norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depended to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remained classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality was left within the powers of the current secret services, created a situation in which the lustrated person's position was put at a clear disadvantage."

In the light of the above, the Court considers that due to the confidentiality of the documents and the limitations on access to the case file by the lustrated person, as well as the privileged position of the Commissioner of the Public Interest in the lustration proceedings, the applicant's ability to prove that the contacts he had had with the communist ‑ era secret services did not amount to “intentional and secret collaboration” within the meaning of the Lustration Act were severely curtailed. Regard being had to the particular context of the lustration proceedings, and to the cumulative application of those rules, the Court considers that they placed an unrealistic burden on the applicant in practice and did not respect the principle of equality of arms."

Given the Government's assertion that the rules on access to the materials classified as secret were regulated by the successive laws on State secrets and Article 156 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure and that those legal provisions were complied with in this case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant, in his appeals or cassation appeals, could have successfully challenged the domestic law in force. The Court points out that the Lustration Act had on several occasions been unsuccessfully challenged before the Constitutional Court (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), cited above ). The Government did not refer to any other domestic remedy that could have been successful in this case.",

France (25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A, p. 22, para. 44) and John Murray v. the United Kingdom (8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 49, para. 45), was the right of an individual not to be compelled to contribute incriminating evidence to be used in a prosecution against him. This principle was closely linked to the presumption of innocence which was expressly guaranteed by Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 6-2) and had been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Communities ( Orkem v. Commission, Case 374/87 [1989] European Court Reports 3283) and by the Constitutional Court of South Africa (Ferreira v. Levin and Others, judgment of 6 December 1995) amongst others.

Like the Commission, it considers that the general requirements of fairness contained in Article 6 (art. 6), including the right not to incriminate oneself, apply to criminal proceedings in respect of all types of criminal offences without distinction from the most simple to the most complex. The public interest cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings. It is noteworthy in this respect that under the relevant legislation statements obtained under compulsory powers by the Serious Fraud Office cannot, as a general rule, be adduced in evidence at the subsequent trial of the person concerned. Moreover the fact that statements were made by the applicant prior to his being charged does not prevent their later use in criminal proceedings from constituting an infringement of the right."

As a result, he was subjected to intensive cross ‑ examination concerning alleged inconsistencies between his oral testimony at trial and his responses to the inspectors ’ questions, to which the trial judge drew attention in his summing-up to the jury.

However, the privilege against self-incrimination was not absolute or immutable. Other jurisdictions ( Norway, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America ) permit the compulsory taking of statements during investigation into corporate and financial frauds and their subsequent use in a criminal trial in order to confront the accused ’ s and witnesses ’ oral testimony. Nor does it follow from an acceptance of the privilege that the prosecution is never to be permitted to use in evidence self-incriminating statements, documents or other evidence obtained as a result of the exercise of compulsory powers.

There can be no absolute rule implicit in Article 6 (art. 6) that any use of statements obtained under compulsion automatically rendered criminal proceedings unfair. In this respect it was necessary to have regard to all the facts of the case including the many procedural safeguards inherent in the system. For example, at the stage of the inspectors ’ inquiry, injustice was prevented by the facts that the inspectors were independent and subject to judicial supervision and that the person questioned was entitled to be legally represented before them and provided with a transcript of his responses which he could correct or expand. Moreover, during the course of any subsequent criminal trial, a defendant who had provided answers to the inspectors under compulsion was protected by the judge ’ s powers to exclude such evidence; admissions which might be unreliable or might have been obtained by oppressive means had to be excluded and there was a discretion to exclude other evidence if its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraphs 51-52 above)."

In this respect a distinction could properly be drawn between corporate fraud and other types of crime, since devices such as complex corporate structures, nominee companies, complicated financial transactions and false accounting records could be used to conceal fraudulent misappropriation of corporate funds or personal responsibility for such misconduct. Frequently the documentary evidence relating to such transactions would be insufficient for a prosecution or incomprehensible without the explanations of the individuals concerned. Furthermore, it had to be remembered that the kind of person questioned by the inspectors was likely to be a sophisticated businessman with access to expert legal advice, who had moreover chosen to take advantage of the benefits afforded by limited liability and separate corporate personality."

The Commission considered that the privilege against self ‑ incrimination formed an important element in safeguarding individuals from oppression and coercion, was linked to the principle of the presumption of innocence and should apply equally to all types of accused, including those alleged to have committed complex corporate frauds. In the instant case, the incriminating material, which the applicant was compelled to provide, furnished a not insignificant part of the evidence against him at the trial, since it contained admissions which must have exerted additional pressure on him to take the witness stand. The use of this evidence was therefore oppressive and substantially impaired Mr Saunders ’ s ability to defend himself against the criminal charges he faced, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.",
                "At the hearing before the Court, the Delegate stressed that even steadfast denials of guilt in answer to incriminating questions can be highly incriminating and very damaging to a defendant. This was so in the present case as the answers were used against him both in the opening and closing speeches and in cross-examination to establish that the answers given to the inspectors could not be believed and that the applicant was dishonest."

                "67. The Court first observes that the applicant ’ s complaint is confined to the use of the statements obtained by the DTI inspectors during the criminal proceedings against him. While an administrative investigation is capable of involving the determination of a \"criminal charge\" in the light of the Court ’ s case-law concerning the autonomous meaning of this concept, it has not been suggested in the pleadings before the Court that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was applicable to the proceedings conducted by the inspectors or that these proceedings themselves involved the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of that provision (art. 6-1) (see, inter alia, the Deweer v. Belgium judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, pp. 21 ‑ 24, paras. 42-47). In this respect the Court recalls its judgment in Fayed v. the United Kingdom where it held that the functions performed by the inspectors under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 were essentially investigative in nature and that they did not adjudicate either in form or in substance. Their purpose was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities - prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative (judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, p. 47, para. 61). As stated in that case, a requirement that such a preparatory investigation should be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure as set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities (ibid., p. 48, para. 62).",

The Court recalls that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6), the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (art. 6). Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 (art. 6) (see the above-mentioned John Murray judgment, p. 49, para. 45, and the above-mentioned Funke judgment, p. 22, para. 44). The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 6-2)."

                "69. The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned, however, with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent. As commonly understood in the legal systems of the Contracting Parties to the Convention and elsewhere, it does not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material which may be obtained from the accused through the use of compulsory powers but which has an existence independent of the will of the suspect such as, inter alia, documents acquired pursuant to a warrant, breath, blood and urine samples and bodily tissue for the purpose of DNA testing.",
                "In the present case the Court is only called upon to decide whether the use made by the prosecution of the statements obtained from the applicant by the inspectors amounted to an unjustifiable infringement of the right. This question must be examined by the Court in the light of all the circumstances of the case. In particular, it must be determined whether the applicant has been subject to compulsion to give evidence and whether the use made of the resulting testimony at his trial offended the basic principles of a fair procedure inherent in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of which the right not to incriminate oneself is a constituent element."

He was obliged under sections 434 and 436 of the Companies Act 1985 (see paragraphs 48-49 above) to answer the questions put to him by the inspectors in the course of nine lengthy interviews of which seven were admissible as evidence at his trial. A refusal by the applicant to answer the questions put to him could have led to a finding of contempt of court and the imposition of a fine or committal to prison for up to two years (see paragraph 50 above) and it was no defence to such refusal that the questions were of an incriminating nature (see paragraph 28 above).",
                "However, the Government have emphasised, before the Court, that nothing said by the applicant in the course of the interviews was self ‑ incriminating and that he had merely given exculpatory answers or answers which, if true, would serve to confirm his defence. In their submission only statements which are self-incriminating could fall within the privilege against self-incrimination."

The Court does not accept the Government ’ s premise on this point since some of the applicant ’ s answers were in fact of an incriminating nature in the sense that they contained admissions to knowledge of information which tended to incriminate him (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, bearing in mind the concept of fairness in Article 6 (art. 6), the right not to incriminate oneself cannot reasonably be confined to statements of admission of wrongdoing or to remarks which are directly incriminating. Testimony obtained under compulsion which appears on its face to be of a non-incriminating nature - such as exculpatory remarks or mere information on questions of fact - may later be deployed in criminal proceedings in support of the prosecution case, for example to contradict or cast doubt upon other statements of the accused or evidence given by him during the trial or to otherwise undermine his credibility. Where the credibility of an accused must be assessed by a jury the use of such testimony may be especially harmful. It follows that what is of the essence in this context is the use to which evidence obtained under compulsion is put in the course of the criminal trial."
            ],
            [
                "72. In this regard, the Court observes that part of the transcript of answers given by the applicant was read to the jury by counsel for the prosecution over a three-day period despite objections by the applicant. The fact that such extensive use was made of the interviews strongly suggests that the prosecution must have believed that the reading of the transcripts assisted their case in establishing the applicant ’ s dishonesty. This interpretation of the intended impact of the material is supported by the remarks made by the trial judge in the course of the voir dire concerning the eighth and ninth interviews to the effect that each of the applicant ’ s statements was capable of being a \"confession\" for the purposes of section 82 (1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraph 53 above). Similarly, the Court of Appeal considered that the interviews formed \"a significant part\" of the prosecution ’ s case against the applicant (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, there were clearly instances where the statements were used by the prosecution to incriminating effect in order to establish the applicant ’ s knowledge of payments to persons involved in the share-support operation and to call into question his honesty (see paragraph 31 above). They were also used by counsel for the applicant ’ s co ‑ accused to cast doubt on the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 32 above).",
                "In sum, the evidence available to the Court supports the claim that the transcripts of the applicant ’ s answers, whether directly self-incriminating or not, were used in the course of the proceedings in a manner which sought to incriminate the applicant."

Both the applicant and the Commission maintained that the admissions contained in the interviews must have exerted additional pressure on the applicant to give testimony during the trial rather than to exercise his right to remain silent. However, it was the Government ’ s view that the applicant chose to give evidence because of the damaging effect of the testimony of the chief witness for the prosecution, Mr Roux.",
                "Although it cannot be excluded that one of the reasons which affected this decision was the extensive use made by the prosecution of the interviews, the Court finds it unnecessary to speculate on the reasons why the applicant chose to give evidence at his trial."

                "It does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the complexity of corporate fraud and the vital public interest in the investigation of such fraud and the punishment of those responsible could justify such a marked departure as that which occurred in the present case from one of the basic principles of a fair procedure. Like the Commission, it considers that the general requirements of fairness contained in Article 6 (art. 6), including the right not to incriminate oneself, apply to criminal proceedings in respect of all types of criminal offences without distinction from the most simple to the most complex. The public interest cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings. It is noteworthy in this respect that under the relevant legislation statements obtained under compulsory powers by the Serious Fraud Office cannot, as a general rule, be adduced in evidence at the subsequent trial of the person concerned. Moreover the fact that statements were made by the applicant prior to his being charged does not prevent their later use in criminal proceedings from constituting an infringement of the right."

Moreover under Article 4 (5) of the Order he remained a non-compellable witness (see paragraph 27 above).

Moreover, as indicated by the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Kevin Sean Murray the prosecutor must first establish a prima facie case against the accused, i.e. a case consisting of direct evidence which, if believed and combined with legitimate inferences based upon it, could lead a properly directed jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the essential elements of the offence is proved (see paragraph 30 above).",

The national court cannot conclude that the accused is guilty merely because he chooses to remain silent. It is only if the evidence against the accused \"calls\" for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give that a failure to give any explanation \"may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty\". Conversely if the case presented by the prosecution had so little evidential value that it called for no answer, a failure to provide one could not justify an inference of guilt (ibid.). In sum, it is only common-sense inferences which the judge considers proper, in the light of the evidence against the accused, that can be drawn under the Order.",

In this context he emphasised that under the Order once an accused has remained silent a trap is set from which he cannot escape: if an accused chooses to give evidence or to call witnesses he is, by reason of his prior silence, exposed to the risk of an Article 3 inference sufficient to bring about a conviction; on the other hand, if he maintains his silence inferences may be drawn against him under other provisions of the Order."

                "In the first place, the applicant did not seek to challenge by way of judicial review the exercise of the statutory power to delay access to a lawyer for up to 48 hours. The power is designed, inter alia, to limit the risk of interference with the vital information-gathering process and the risk that a person involved in an act of terrorism or still at large may be alerted. The denial of access was therefore a bona fide exercise of necessary and carefully designed statutory powers on reasonable grounds.",
                "Secondly, as accepted by the Commission, the inferences drawn under Articles 4 and 6 of the Order were not the only evidence against the applicant. Furthermore the delay of access to a lawyer was for a limited period of 48 hours. Thereafter he had access to lawyers of his own choosing. He was represented both at his trial and on appeal by experienced solicitors and counsel and was in receipt of legal aid.",
                "The Government did not accept that the applicant was irretrievably prejudiced in his defence because of the denial of access. They submitted that if, having consulted his solicitor, he had accounted for his presence at the scene of the crime and put forward an innocent explanation, it would have been extremely unlikely that Article 3 or Article 6 inferences would have been drawn. Moreover there was nothing to suggest, in his attitude or actions, that he would have acted differently had he seen a solicitor from the beginning. He had consistently refused to answer any questions put to him, both before and after he had consulted with his solicitor. In order to make out a case of actual prejudice it must be alleged by the applicant that if he had been able to consult his solicitor earlier he would have acted differently.",

The Court observes that it has not been disputed by the Government that Article 6 (art. 6) applies even at the stage of the preliminary investigation into an offence by the police. In this respect it recalls its finding in the Imbrioscia v. Switzerland judgment of 24 November 1993 that Article 6 (art. 6) - especially paragraph 3 (art. 6-3) - may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (art. 6-3) (Series A no. 275, p. 13, para. 36). As it pointed out in that judgment, the manner in which Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case (loc. cit., p. 14, para. 38)."

In such circumstances Article 6 (art. 6) will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right, which is not explicitly set out in the Convention, may be subject to restrictions for good cause.

The Court, however, has no reason to doubt that it amounted to a lawful exercise of the power to restrict access.

The Court is of the opinion that the scheme contained in the Order is such that it is of paramount importance for the rights of the defence that an accused has access to a lawyer at the initial stages of police interrogation. It observes in this context that, under the Order, at the beginning of police interrogation, an accused is confronted with a fundamental dilemma relating to his defence. If he chooses to remain silent, adverse inferences may be drawn against him in accordance with the provisions of the Order. On the other hand, if the accused opts to break his silence during the course of interrogation, he runs the risk of prejudicing his defence without necessarily removing the possibility of inferences being drawn against him.",

To deny access to a lawyer for the first 48 hours of police questioning, in a situation where the rights of the defence may well be irretrievably prejudiced, is - whatever the justification for such denial - incompatible with the rights of the accused under Article 6 (art. 6)."

However, it is not for the Court to speculate on what the applicant ’ s reaction, or his lawyer ’ s advice, would have been had access not been denied during this initial period. As matters stand, the applicant was undoubtedly directly affected by the denial of access and the ensuing interference with the rights of the defence.

The Court recalls that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6), the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (art. 6). Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 (art. 6) (see the above-mentioned John Murray judgment, p. 49, para. 45, and the above-mentioned Funke judgment, p. 22, para. 44). The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 6-2)."

This principle was closely linked to the presumption of innocence which was expressly guaranteed by Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 6-2) and had been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Communities ( Orkem v. Commission, Case 374/87 [1989] European Court Reports 3283) and by the Constitutional Court of South Africa (Ferreira v. Levin and Others, judgment of 6 December 1995) amongst others.

Furthermore, the applicant argued that this use of the transcripts was particularly unfair in his case since, in the words of the Court of Appeal, they \"formed a significant part of the prosecution case\". Three days were spent reading extracts from his interviews with the inspectors to the jury before Mr Saunders decided that he ought to give evidence to explain and expand upon this material. As a result, he was subjected to intensive cross ‑ examination concerning alleged inconsistencies between his oral testimony at trial and his responses to the inspectors ’ questions, to which the trial judge drew attention in his summing-up to the jury. The prosecution ’ s task was thus facilitated when it was able to contrast its own evidence with Mr Saunders ’ s more specific denials in his interviews."

However, exculpatory answers or answers which, if true, are consistent with or would serve to confirm the defence of an accused cannot be properly characterised as self-incriminating. In their submission, neither the applicant nor the Commission had identified at any stage a single answer given by the applicant to the DTI inspectors which was self-incriminating. There cannot be derived from the privilege against self-incrimination a further right not to be confronted with evidence that requires the accused, in order successfully to rebut it, to give evidence himself. That, in effect, was what the applicant was claiming when he alleged that the admission of the transcript \"compelled\" him to give evidence.",

However, the privilege against self-incrimination was not absolute or immutable. Other jurisdictions ( Norway, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America ) permit the compulsory taking of statements during investigation into corporate and financial frauds and their subsequent use in a criminal trial in order to confront the accused ’ s and witnesses ’ oral testimony. Nor does it follow from an acceptance of the privilege that the prosecution is never to be permitted to use in evidence self-incriminating statements, documents or other evidence obtained as a result of the exercise of compulsory powers. Examples of such permitted use include the prosecution ’ s right to obtain documents pursuant to search warrants or samples of breath, blood or urine."

In the Government ’ s submission it would be wrong to draw from the Court ’ s Funke judgment (referred to at paragraph 60 above) a broad statement of principle concerning the \"right to silence\", since the nature of that right was not defined in the judgment. There can be no absolute rule implicit in Article 6 (art. 6) that any use of statements obtained under compulsion automatically rendered criminal proceedings unfair. In this respect it was necessary to have regard to all the facts of the case including the many procedural safeguards inherent in the system. For example, at the stage of the inspectors ’ inquiry, injustice was prevented by the facts that the inspectors were independent and subject to judicial supervision and that the person questioned was entitled to be legally represented before them and provided with a transcript of his responses which he could correct or expand. Moreover, during the course of any subsequent criminal trial, a defendant who had provided answers to the inspectors under compulsion was protected by the judge ’ s powers to exclude such evidence; admissions which might be unreliable or might have been obtained by oppressive means had to be excluded and there was a discretion to exclude other evidence if its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraphs 51-52 above)."

The Government further emphasised that, whilst the interests of the individual should not be overlooked, there was also a public interest in the honest conduct of companies and in the effective prosecution of those involved in complex corporate fraud. This latter interest required both that those under suspicion should be compelled to respond to the questions of inspectors and that the prosecuting authorities should be able to rely in any subsequent criminal trial on the responses elicited. In this respect a distinction could properly be drawn between corporate fraud and other types of crime, since devices such as complex corporate structures, nominee companies, complicated financial transactions and false accounting records could be used to conceal fraudulent misappropriation of corporate funds or personal responsibility for such misconduct. Frequently the documentary evidence relating to such transactions would be insufficient for a prosecution or incomprehensible without the explanations of the individuals concerned. Furthermore, it had to be remembered that the kind of person questioned by the inspectors was likely to be a sophisticated businessman with access to expert legal advice, who had moreover chosen to take advantage of the benefits afforded by limited liability and separate corporate personality."

In the instant case, the incriminating material, which the applicant was compelled to provide, furnished a not insignificant part of the evidence against him at the trial, since it contained admissions which must have exerted additional pressure on him to take the witness stand. The use of this evidence was therefore oppressive and substantially impaired Mr Saunders ’ s ability to defend himself against the criminal charges he faced, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.",

While an administrative investigation is capable of involving the determination of a \"criminal charge\" in the light of the Court ’ s case-law concerning the autonomous meaning of this concept, it has not been suggested in the pleadings before the Court that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was applicable to the proceedings conducted by the inspectors or that these proceedings themselves involved the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of that provision (art. 6-1) (see, inter alia, the Deweer v. Belgium judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, pp. 21 ‑ 24, paras. 42-47). In this respect the Court recalls its judgment in Fayed v. the United Kingdom where it held that the functions performed by the inspectors under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 were essentially investigative in nature and that they did not adjudicate either in form or in substance. Their purpose was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities - prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative (judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, p. 47, para. 61). As stated in that case, a requirement that such a preparatory investigation should be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure as set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities (ibid., p. 48, para. 62).",

The Court recalls that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6), the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (art. 6). Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 (art. 6) (see the above-mentioned John Murray judgment, p. 49, para. 45, and the above-mentioned Funke judgment, p. 22, para. 44). The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 6-2)."

This question must be examined by the Court in the light of all the circumstances of the case. In particular, it must be determined whether the applicant has been subject to compulsion to give evidence and whether the use made of the resulting testimony at his trial offended the basic principles of a fair procedure inherent in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of which the right not to incriminate oneself is a constituent element."

He was obliged under sections 434 and 436 of the Companies Act 1985 (see paragraphs 48-49 above) to answer the questions put to him by the inspectors in the course of nine lengthy interviews of which seven were admissible as evidence at his trial. A refusal by the applicant to answer the questions put to him could have led to a finding of contempt of court and the imposition of a fine or committal to prison for up to two years (see paragraph 50 above) and it was no defence to such refusal that the questions were of an incriminating nature (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Court does not accept the Government ’ s premise on this point since some of the applicant ’ s answers were in fact of an incriminating nature in the sense that they contained admissions to knowledge of information which tended to incriminate him (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, bearing in mind the concept of fairness in Article 6 (art. 6), the right not to incriminate oneself cannot reasonably be confined to statements of admission of wrongdoing or to remarks which are directly incriminating. Testimony obtained under compulsion which appears on its face to be of a non-incriminating nature - such as exculpatory remarks or mere information on questions of fact - may later be deployed in criminal proceedings in support of the prosecution case, for example to contradict or cast doubt upon other statements of the accused or evidence given by him during the trial or to otherwise undermine his credibility. Where the credibility of an accused must be assessed by a jury the use of such testimony may be especially harmful. It follows that what is of the essence in this context is the use to which evidence obtained under compulsion is put in the course of the criminal trial."

In this regard, the Court observes that part of the transcript of answers given by the applicant was read to the jury by counsel for the prosecution over a three-day period despite objections by the applicant. The fact that such extensive use was made of the interviews strongly suggests that the prosecution must have believed that the reading of the transcripts assisted their case in establishing the applicant ’ s dishonesty. This interpretation of the intended impact of the material is supported by the remarks made by the trial judge in the course of the voir dire concerning the eighth and ninth interviews to the effect that each of the applicant ’ s statements was capable of being a \"confession\" for the purposes of section 82 (1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (see paragraph 53 above). Similarly, the Court of Appeal considered that the interviews formed \"a significant part\" of the prosecution ’ s case against the applicant (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, there were clearly instances where the statements were used by the prosecution to incriminating effect in order to establish the applicant ’ s knowledge of payments to persons involved in the share-support operation and to call into question his honesty (see paragraph 31 above). They were also used by counsel for the applicant ’ s co ‑ accused to cast doubt on the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 32 above).",

Like the Commission, it considers that the general requirements of fairness contained in Article 6 (art. 6), including the right not to incriminate oneself, apply to criminal proceedings in respect of all types of criminal offences without distinction from the most simple to the most complex. The public interest cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings. It is noteworthy in this respect that under the relevant legislation statements obtained under compulsory powers by the Serious Fraud Office cannot, as a general rule, be adduced in evidence at the subsequent trial of the person concerned.

The Court recognises that the use of confidential material may prove unavoidable where national security is at stake (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 131 in limine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V). It may therefore sometimes be necessary to classify some or all of the materials used in proceedings touching upon such matters and even parts of the decisions rendered in them (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § § 2 05, 209, 210 and 215, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). However, the complete concealment from the public of the entirety of a judicial decision in such proceedings cannot be regarded as warranted. The publicity of judicial decisions aims to ensure scrutiny of the judiciary by the public and constitutes a basic safeguard against arbitrariness. Indeed, even in indisputable national security cases, such as those relating to terrorist activities, the authorities of countries which have already suffered and are currently at risk of terrorist attacks have chosen to keep secret only those parts of their decisions whose disclosure would compromise national security or the safety of others (ibid., §§ 29 ‑ 69, 93 and 215 ), thus illustrating that there exist techniques which can accommodate legitimate security concerns without fully negating fundamental procedural guarantees such as the publicity of judicial decisions. Moreover, in the absence of information about the facts under consideration before the national courts and the manner in which they examined the case, the Court is not persuaded that it concerned genuine national security issues. Indeed, the only known allegation against Mr Raza was that “ there existed information that [he] had been involved in human trafficking ” (see paragraph 17 above). Failing further particulars about the threat to national security which the applicant allegedly posed, the Court is bound to conclude that the situation was identical to that in C.G. and Others, where the Bulgarian authorities had stretched the – admittedly wide – notion of national security beyond its natural meaning (see C.G. and Others, cited above, § 43)."

On 7 May 2008 the Sofia Administrative Court declared Mrs Raza ’ s application inadmissible, because she was not directly affected by the order, but found Mr Raza ’ s application admissible and well ‑ founded. It noted that the immigration authorities had sent three letters to the consular department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with requests for assistance in the process of securing a travel document for Mr Raza, but that no reply had been received. It went on to say that, in view of the difficulties in carrying out the expulsion, the authorities should have re ‑ considered whether or not Mr Raza ’ s detention continued to be justified. In situations where they had discretion, the authorities had to assess whether or not the impugned measures interfered disproportionately with the individual ’ s rights and, whenever possible, opt for the option that was less onerous for the individual, in line with the principle of proportionality. The exercise of such discretion was subject to judicial review. Instead of keeping Mr Raza in custody, the authorities could have placed him under an obligation to report daily to his local police station. In choosing between those alternatives, they had to take account of the length of the detention. If it exceeded six months, it became an arbitrary deprivation of liberty, contrary to Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention. The inordinate amount of time spent by Mr Raza in custody, owing to the lack of effective measures for his expulsion, had negated the lawfulness of his deprivation of liberty. As the authorities had not taken those matters into account, they had made an unlawful decision.

According to the applicants ’ allegations, in the present case the Supreme Administrative Court adopted the same stance as in C.G. and Others – it did not properly scrutinise the facts grounding the decision to expel Mr Raza and had regard merely to a document specifically drawn up by the authorities for the purposes of the judicial review proceedings (see paragraph 24 above). The applicants were unable to support those allegations with proof, as the domestic proceedings were classified and they were not allowed to make copies of the documents in the case file (see paragraph 25 above). In these circumstances, and considering that the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s reasoning was crucial for the determination of the point raised by the applicants, on 10 September 2009 the Court asked the Government to produce a copy of that court ’ s judgment of 17 January 2008 and to specify what materials that court had had before it when making that judgment. In as much as the domestic proceedings were classified, the Government ’ s attention was drawn to the possibility, under Rule 33 § 2 of the Rules of Court, to request that public access to the documents they were asked to provide be restricted ( see Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, § 123, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII (extracts) ). The Government did not reply to the Court ’ s letter (see paragraph 5 above), thus failing to provide any justification for their refusal to provide the document and information requested by the Court."

Where an application contains a complaint concerning the manner in which a domestic court has approached and determined a case, and where, as in the instant case, a copy of that court ’ s judgment and related information is specifically requested from the Government, the Court considers it incumbent on the respondent State to furnish the relevant documentation (see, mutatis mutandis, Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, § 138, 24 February 2005 ). Accordingly, and in application of Rule 44C § 1 of its Rules, the Court finds that it can draw inferences from the Government ’ s conduct in that respect (ibid., § 139; see also Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine, no. 54825/00, § 77, 5 April 2005, and Imakayeva, cited above, § 124 )."

The Court recognises that the use of confidential material may prove unavoidable where national security is at stake (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 131 in limine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V). It may therefore sometimes be necessary to classify some or all of the materials used in proceedings touching upon such matters and even parts of the decisions rendered in them (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § § 2 05, 209, 210 and 215, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). However, the complete concealment from the public of the entirety of a judicial decision in such proceedings cannot be regarded as warranted. The publicity of judicial decisions aims to ensure scrutiny of the judiciary by the public and constitutes a basic safeguard against arbitrariness. Indeed, even in indisputable national security cases, such as those relating to terrorist activities, the authorities of countries which have already suffered and are currently at risk of terrorist attacks have chosen to keep secret only those parts of their decisions whose disclosure would compromise national security or the safety of others (ibid., §§ 29 ‑ 69, 93 and 215 ), thus illustrating that there exist techniques which can accommodate legitimate security concerns without fully negating fundamental procedural guarantees such as the publicity of judicial decisions. Moreover, in the absence of information about the facts under consideration before the national courts and the manner in which they examined the case, the Court is not persuaded that it concerned genuine national security issues. Indeed, the only known allegation against Mr Raza was that “ there existed information that [he] had been involved in human trafficking ” (see paragraph 17 above). Failing further particulars about the threat to national security which the applicant allegedly posed, the Court is bound to conclude that the situation was identical to that in C.G. and Others, where the Bulgarian authorities had stretched the – admittedly wide – notion of national security beyond its natural meaning (see C.G. and Others, cited above, § 43)."

As noted above, despite a specific question the Government did not disclose what materials that court had had before it when making its judgment. The Court therefore concludes, on the basis of its inference (see paragraph 52 above), that the Supreme Administrative Court did not have access to the full facts grounding the authorities ’ assertion that Mr Raza presented a national security risk, which prevented it from conducting a meaningful examination of the case. It is moreover questionable – and by not presenting the requested information the Government failed to dispel the doubts in that respect – whether that court considered itself competent to carry out a proper examination of that assertion, given that in C.G. and Others it had confined itself to a purely formal review of an identical expulsion decision and had rested its ruling solely on uncorroborated information tendered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (see C.G. and Others, cited above, § 47, and Lupsa v.

All that is required under it is that “action is being taken with a view to deportation”. It is therefore immaterial whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see Chahal, cited above, § 112; Slivenko v.

However, any deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as deportation proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible ( see Chahal, § 113, and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, § 164 in limine, both cited above ). In other words, the length of the detention for this purpose should not exceed that reasonably required (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 74 in fine, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...)."

Throughout this period his deportation was apparently blocked solely by the lack of a travel document allowing him to re ‑ enter Pakistan. It is true that the Bulgarian authorities could not compel the issuing of such document, but there is no indication that they pursued the matter vigorously or endeavoured entering into negotiations with the Pakistani authorities with a view to expediting its delivery (see, mutatis mutandis, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 167 ). Indeed, both the Sofia City Court and the Sofia Administrative Court, which examined that point in detail, specifically found that the authorities were not doing enough in that respect (see paragraphs 26 and 28 above).

However, Mr Chahal ’ s deportation was blocked, throughout the entire period under consideration, by the fact that proceedings were being actively and diligently pursued with a view to determining whether it would be lawful and compatible with the Convention to proceed with his deportation (see Chahal, cited above, §§ 115 ‑ 17, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Eid v. Italy (dec.), no. 53490/99, 22 January 2002, and Bogdanovski v. Italy, no. 72177/01, §§ 60 ‑ 64, 14 December 2006 ). By contrast, the delay in the present case was not at all due to the need to wait for the courts to determine the legal challenge brought by Mr Raza against his deportation. Indeed, his request for a stay of the enforcement of the expulsion order was denied as early as 7 December 2006 (see paragraph 19 above), and the Government conceded that the only reason for the delay was the failure to secure the necessary travel documents from the Pakistani authorities (see paragraph 68 above). It should also be observed that after his release on 15 July 2008 Mr Raza was placed under an obligation to report to his local police station at regular intervals (see paragraph 14 above). This shows that the authorities had at their disposal measures other than the applicant ’ s protracted detention to secure the enforcement of the order for his expulsion. Lastly, the Court notes that after the events in issue in the present case Bulgarian law was changed, in line with the recent European Union Directive 2008/115/EC on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third ‑ country nationals, and now provides that in situations akin to Mr Raza ’ s, where deportation is blocked by the failure of a third country to deliver the necessary travel documents, detention cannot exceed eighteen months (see paragraphs 36 and 40 above ).

For this reason, Article 5 § 4 stipulates that a remedy must be made available during a person ’ s detention to allow him or her to obtain speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see, as a recent authority, Sadaykov, cited above, § 32 )."

Quite evidently, the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law.",

The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly ’ s work, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly.",

That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter. The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over the years show that Parliament ’ s powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited. Furthermore, the fact that immunity has a place in the Constitution means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the intention, when immunity was provided for in Article 83, was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. In other words, the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented, even temporarily, from fulfilling their functions by arbitrary criminal proceedings.

Most European states recognise two categories of immunity for parliamentarians: firstly, the “ non-liability ” of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings for opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties; secondly, their “ inviolability ” or “ immunity in the strict sense ”, shielding them from all arrest, detention or prosecution for offences unrelated to their parliamentary duties without the consent of the Chamber to which they belong. This comparative law study focuses on the latter aspect of parliamentary immunity ( see the Venice Commission ’ s Report on the regime of parliamentary immunity, 1996)."

The very nature of this aspect of immunity results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation. In some States there is no such institution (the Netherlands, San Marino). In others its scope is very limited. For example, in the United Kingdom inviolability covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual. In Ireland and Norway parliamentary inviolability serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from Parliament. It therefore affords them limited protection."

That said, most of the States Parties to the Convention grant their MPs immunity from criminal prosecution during their term as MPs that goes beyond the exercise of parliamentary functions (Albania, Austria and Germany – if the act does not clearly fall outside the ambit of their political activities – and Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland) and/or protection against imprisonment or deprivation of liberty (arrest or detention in all those countries which provide for immunity from prosecution, as well as Belgium, France, Georgia, Portugal and Romania). In certain cases MPs are protected from body searches, house searches and interception of their communications ( Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Switzerland ). Such proceedings or measures may be executed only with the consent of the assembly to which the MP belongs, except in Cyprus, where such decisions lie with the courts."

In France, for example, since the constitutional reform of 1995, the Chamber ’ s authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought, but only for detention, arrest and other judicial supervision measures. A similar change came about in Italy when Constitutional Law no. 3 of 29 October 1993 did away with the need for the prior authorisation of Parliament in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP. In Romania, since the constitutional reform of 2003, senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators."

In such cases the prior authorisation of the Chamber concerned is not required, but even this does not necessarily prevent Parliament from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures ( Georgia and Romania, for example ). In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from inviolability, or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred ( the Portuguese Constitution excludes, in certain circumstances, deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for over three years )."

It is set in motion by a proposal or a request for authorisation by the competent public authority (in most cases the Principal State Prosecutor), the injured party or the parliamentarian concerned. The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the Parliament, either directly or in certain cases through another authority ( the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister), then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee, which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned. It is then for the full Chamber to decide, with or without a debate, in private or in public, whether or not to lift immunity. The possibility of appealing against a decision of the Chamber to lift immunity exists in very few countries (Austria and Germany).",

In most of the Contracting States no provision is made for MPs to forgo their immunity of their own free will because immunity is a privilege granted not to MPs on an individual basis but to Parliament, to guarantee its smooth operation. In France provisions governing immunity are traditionally a matter of public policy and MPs cannot renounce it. Any act that violates parliamentary immunity is considered null and void. The question of immunity must be raised by a judge. A similar approach has been adopted in the European Parliament, where renunciation of immunity has no legal effect."

That does not mean, however, that parliamentary immunity can be regarded in principle as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to a court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the Contracting States as part of the doctrine of parliamentary immunity (see A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 83)."

The Court has already acknowledged that the long-standing practice for States generally to confer varying degrees of immunity on parliamentarians pursues the legitimate aims of protecting free speech in Parliament and maintaining the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary ( see A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 75-78; Cordova ( no. 1 ), cited above, § 55; Cordova ( no. 2 ), cited above, § 56; and De Jorio, cited above, § 49). Different forms of parliamentary immunity may indeed serve to protect the effective political democracy that constitutes one of the cornerstones of the Convention system, particularly where they protect the autonomy of the legislature and the parliamentary opposition."

Indeed, the lack of any clear connection with parliamentary activity requires the Court to adopt a narrow interpretation of the concept of proportionality between the aim sought to be achieved and the means employed. This is particularly so where the restrictions on the right of access stem from the resolution of a political body ( see Tsalkitzis, cited above, § 49). Thus, where a personal quarrel was involved it would not be right to deny someone access to a court purely on the basis that the quarrel might be political in nature or connected with political activities ( see Cordova ( no. 1 ), cited above, § 62; Cordova ( no. 2 ), cited above, § 63; and De Jorio, cited above, § 53)."

It considers that the guarantees offered by both types of parliamentary immunity ( non-liability and inviolability ) serve the same need – that of ensuring the independence of Parliament in the performance of its task. Without a doubt, inviolability helps to achieve the full independence of Parliament by preventing any possibility of politically motivated criminal proceedings ( fumus persecutionis ) and thereby protecting the opposition from pressure or abuse on the part of the majority."

In this sense it recognises the institutional aim of this prerogative, which is to guarantee the smooth functioning and the integrity of Parliament. In these conditions the Court cannot but recognise the legitimacy, relied on by the Government ( see paragraphs 75 and 78 above ), of the aim pursued by this exception to the ordinary law."

However, the Court agrees with the Chamber ’ s finding (Chamber judgment, § 83) that having established the legitimacy of parliamentary inviolability, the Court cannot arrive at any conclusion concerning its compatibility with the Convention without considering the circumstances of the case. It must first assess the proportionality of the measure in relation to the applicant ’ s rights under Article 6 of the Convention. No matter how legitimate the justifications for parliamentary inviolability, in practice it protects not only the constituent powers but also individual MPs against any judicial proceedings or criminal conviction while they are members of parliament. In the particular circumstances of the present case, however, the protection concerned did not serve the interests of its beneficiary, who wanted it lifted."

In this context the Court must verify whether parliamentary inviolability as implemented by the Turkish Parliament has restricted the applicant ’ s right under Article 6 of the Convention in such a way or to such a degree that its very essence is impaired. Verifying the proportionality of the measure means taking into account the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest in preserving Parliament ’ s integrity and the applicant ’ s individual interests. In so doing the Court must pay particular attention to the scope of the inviolability in the instant case. In particular it is for the Court to examine whether or not the provision of the Constitution, in the circumstances of the instant case, led to a denial of justice. The Court must not lose sight of the fact that Article 6 § 1 must be read in the light of the fundamental principle which forbids the denial of justice ( see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 35, Series A no. 18 )."

In this case the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant concern personal acts committed prior to his election to Parliament. It must be remembered in this context that the exemptions that characterise parliamentary inviolability are intended to protect – above and beyond individual MPs – the integrity of the national parliament. That being so, it is in relation to the need to preserve the institutional purpose of parliamentary inviolability that the effect on the applicant ’ s rights of the manner in which inviolability was applied in his case must be examined : the less the protective measure serves to protect the integrity of Parliament, the more compelling its justification must be."

The Court emphasises in addition that while its role is to assess the limits of parliamentary immunity with regard to the rights enshrined in the Convention, decisions whether or not to lift immunity indubitably fall within the margin of appreciation of the States and it is not for the Court to substitute its own assessment for that of the national authorities as to whether immunity is necessary or appropriate in a given case. Provided that parliamentary practice is in keeping with the imperatives of the rule of law as embodied in the Convention, it is not the Court ’ s role to serve as a supervisory mechanism for verifying the appropriateness of the choices made by parliamentary authorities in the matter."

In order to make sure that the rule of law has been respected, the first step is to examine the institutional configuration of the system of parliamentary inviolability in Turkish law and the conditions of its implementation. The Court reiterates in this regard that inviolability is not a personal privilege for the benefit of the MP but rather a privilege linked to his or her status, which is why it cannot be waived by the beneficiary ( see paragraphs 32 and 33 above ). It is true that the inviolability enjoyed by Turkish MPs appears to be broader in many respects than that enjoyed by MPs in certain other Contracting States ( see paragraphs 45 -5 3 above ). In particular, it covers criminal offences they allegedly committed before their election as well as those allegedly committed during their term in Parliament, and protects them from arrest, questioning, detention and judicial proceedings ( see paragraph 30 above )."

Parliamentary inviolability in Turkey is relative; not only is it limited in time to the duration of the MP ’ s term but it is also subject to an exception, in that it may be lifted. It also applies only to criminal matters, which means that Turkish MPs are not protected against civil actions. Nor does it apply in certain cases of flagrante delicto or specific crimes against the regime or the State ( see paragraph 30 above ). Furthermore, while the scope of parliamentary inviolability in Turkey is more broadly defined, it does not seem to be at odds with the solutions adopted in most European parliamentary systems ( see paragraphs 44-55 above )."

Such decisions are a matter for the internal proceedings of Parliament and therefore fall within that body ’ s sphere of competence alone.

The procedure in question also appears to be subject to certain formalities which secure respect for the rights of the defence at every stage of the decision-making process and a right of appeal against the decisions taken by the relevant parliamentary bodies ( see paragraphs 31 and 32 above ).

As to the applicant ’ s arguments that the decision-making procedure lacked clarity, the Court points out that the machinery for implementing parliamentary liability by a decision to lift or not to lift immunity is one of the ways in which Parliament exercises its autonomy. The decisions taken in the matter by parliamentary bodies, which are political bodies by definition, are therefore political decisions by nature and not court decisions, so they cannot be expected to satisfy the same criteria as court decisions when it comes to giving reasons."

Furthermore, the lists submitted by the parties concerning the requests for the lifting of immunity pending before the 22nd Parliament and at the start of the 23rd Parliament ( see paragraphs 2 6 and 3 7 above ) show the existence of a constant trend in the practice of the parliamentary bodies concerned since the election of the 22 nd Parliament not to grant any request to lift an MP ’ s immunity. As this practice is applied without distinction both to members of the majority and to those of the opposition, Parliament ’ s decisions not to allow requests for the lifting of immunity are free of any personal considerations ( intuitus personae ), be it with regard to the personality of the interested party or to his political convictions.

It is worth noting here, in the light of both the provisions of domestic law and parliamentary practice in the matter, that while the examination of the requests by the relevant parliamentary committees is limited in time by predefined deadlines ( see paragraph 32 above), that is not the case once they have been transferred to the plenary Assembly."

In the instant case there is no reason to consider that the applicant will not be able to have a fair trial when he ceases to be an MP. The parliamentary procedure does not appear to adversely affect that possibility in any way, particularly as it has no effect on the presumption of innocence to which all accused persons are entitled.

In this case, when examining the applicant ’ s request to lift his immunity Parliament seems only to have considered whether inviolability, as a temporary obstacle to judicial action, should be lifted immediately or whether it was preferable to wait until the end of the applicant ’ s term in Parliament.

The Court is of the opinion that the flight of an accused person has in itself certain repercussions on the scope of the guarantee provided by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the duration of proceedings. When an accused person flees from a State which respects the principle of the rule of law, it may be assumed that he or she is not entitled to complain of the unreasonable duration of proceedings following that flight, unless sufficient reason can be shown to rebut this assumption (see Ventura v. Italy, no. 7438/76, Commission ’ s report of 15 December 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 23, p. 91, § 197). Since there is nothing to rebut the assumption in the present case, the relevant period must be regarded as having ended on 19 October 2001, the day of the applicant ’ s release pending trial (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Ireland, no. 9429/81, Commission decision of 2 March 1983, DR 32, p. 226). The relevant period to be taken into account is therefore over five years and one month for one level of jurisdiction."

                "66. The Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of a fair trial that is required by paragraph 1. The presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see, among other authorities, Deweer v. Belgium, judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 30, § 56; Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, §§ 27, 30 and 37; Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41-44, ECHR 2000 ‑ X and Matijašević v.

Furthermore, a distinction should be made between statements which reflect the opinion that the person concerned is guilty and statements which merely describe “a state of suspicion”. The former infringe the presumption of innocence, whereas the latter have been regarded as unobjectionable in various situations examined by the Court (see, inter alia, Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, p. 25, § 62 and Leutscher v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ II, p. 436, § 31)."

Austria (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p.37, § 4), the second limb of Article 5 § 3 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006- ... )."

To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of the above-mentioned requirement of public interest justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5 and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 (see, for example, Labita v.

The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The complexity and special characteristics of the investigation are factors to be considered in this respect (see, for example, Scott v. Spain, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2399-2400, § 74, and I.A. v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2978, § 102)."

In sum, domestic courts are under an obligation to review the continued detention of persons pending trial with a view to ensuring release when circumstances no longer justify continued deprivation of liberty. For at least an initial period, the existence of reasonable suspicion may justify detention but there comes a moment when this is no longer enough. As the question whether or not a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract but must be assessed in each case according to its special features, there is no fixed time-frame applicable to each case (see McKay, cited above, § 45).",

The Court observes that the judicial authorities, in addition to the reasonable suspicion against the applicant, relied principally on two grounds, namely (1) the severity of penalty to which he was liable given the serious nature of the charges against him and (2) the risk of obstruction of the proceedings. In respect of the latter, they referred to the fact that the applicant had not confessed. The domestic courts further considered that there had been a risk that the applicant, if released, might exert pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had incriminated him (see paragraph 13 above). They also invoked the risk of the applicant going into hiding, without however specifying the grounds for such suspicion. Lastly, the judicial authorities referred to the complexity of the case and the significant volume of evidence to be examined at the trial."

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk existed. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

As regards the risk of obstruction of the proceedings, the Court notes that in its decision of 15 January 2001 the Katowice Regional Court held that such risk was justified by the fact that the applicant had not confessed. In so far as the domestic courts appear to have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the Court considers that their reasoning showed a manifest disregard for the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of the applicant ’ s liberty (see Górski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, § 58, 4 October 2005; Leszczak v. Poland, no. 36576/03, § 48, 7 March 2006 ). Secondly, the judicial authorities considered that there had been a risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of the proceedings by exerting pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had testified against them. The Court observes that it was legitimate for the authorities to consider that factor as capable of justifying the applicant ’ s detention at the initial stages of the proceedings. However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed and it cannot accept it as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire period."

In that regard the Court would also point out that, although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is one of long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and the anticipated sentence (see Muller v.

The presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see, among other authorities, Deweer v. Belgium, judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 30, § 56; Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, §§ 27, 30 and 37; Allenet de Ribemont v.

It has acknowledged that in cases where an applicant was an important political figure at the time of the alleged offence the highest State officials, including the Prosecutor General, were required to keep the public informed of the alleged offence and the ensuing criminal proceedings. However, this circumstance could not justify any use of words chosen by the officials in their interviews with the press (see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts)). The Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, inter alia, Adolf v.

Having regard to the explicit and unqualified character of the impugned statement, the Court finds that it amounted to a pronouncement of the applicant ’ s guilt before he was proved guilty according to law.

The Court therefore considers that the authorities were thereby made sufficiently aware of the applicant ’ s situation. It is true that he did not lodge separate complaints with the courts or prosecutor ’ s offices as suggested by the Government. However the Government did not demonstrate what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by such a measure, taking into account that the problems arising from the conditions of his detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not only concern his personal situation (see Kalashnikov v.

It also reiterates that in cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Koval v. Ukraine ( dec .), no. 65550/01, 30 March 2004). In the instant case, during the period of his detention the applicant was held in two detention facilities and was transferred to other facilities several times. Therefore, with respect to the Government objection that the application in respect of detention conditions in the Kingisepp police department had been submitted too late, the question to be resolved is whether the whole period of the applicant ’ s detention constitutes a “continuing situation”, and thus meets the six-month criterion."

Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation ( see Camberrow MM5 AD v. Bulgaria, ( dec .), no. 50357/99, 1 April 2004 ). Hence, the Court has previously refused to treat the time spent by applicants in different detention facilities as a continuing situation in cases where their complaints related to specific episodes, such as force - feeding (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine ( dec .), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003), failure to render medical assistance at different facilities (see Tarariyeva v.

Russia ( dec .), no. 6847/02, 22 February 2005). Further, where an applicant has been released between different periods of detention, the Court has limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006, and Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007 )."

His complaints do not relate to any specific event but concern the whole range of problems regarding the sanitary conditions, the temperature in the cells, overcrowding and so on, which he suffered during the entire period of his detention.

The unit had 10 cells and natural light. The applicant had received food in the detention facility in the morning before departure for the court and in the evening after he had been brought back.

Furthermore, on the day of the hearing he had been woken up at around 4.20 a. m. and returned late in the evening; he had not been given any food during the day.

In that connection, it notes that the applicant ’ s detention in these conditions was of limited duration. Even though the size of the court cell which he shared with other prisoners in the temporary detention unit could potentially raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Moiseyev v. Russia, ( dec .), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004 ), it is to be observed that he was only confined there for a period of one day. Furthermore, in the present case it cannot be established “beyond reasonable doubt” that ventilation, lighting or sanitary conditions in the court cell were unacceptable from the standpoint of Article 3, nor is it possible to contest the documents produced by the Governments with respect to the handcuffing of the applicant. Finally, neither the Government nor the applicant specified the number of defendants who were in the metal cage in the courtroom with the applicant during the hearing on 11 December 2002."

His criticism was directed at the fact that Articles 630 and 636 of the Code of Criminal Procedure established an absolute bar on an accused being defended by counsel at the trial or appealing to the Court of Cassation against an assize-court judgment delivered following trial in absentia. He added that the Government ’ s assertion that such judgments were only provisional was incorrect. In the instant case, the civil party had sought to enforce the judgment on the civil claims in Germany, while the French authorities had not only issued a warrant for his arrest, they had also requested his extradition from Austria. Lastly, the applicant maintained that purging the contempt did not amount to a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, since the exercise of that remedy was contingent on the accused ’ s prior imprisonment, a condition that had not been contemplated by the Convention. Furthermore, the fact that it was possible to obtain a retrial after the contempt had been purged did not cure the violations that had been identified at the first stage of the proceedings, notably the bars on representation by a lawyer and appeals to the Court of Cassation."

He had not been formally charged by the French investigating judge until 1991, that is to say seven years after the French investigation had started. Between 1984 and 1991 he had been questioned only as a witness and had had no reason to travel to France, particularly as the French judge had been given access to all the evidence obtained in the investigations carried out in Germany through the letters-rogatory procedure. He added that at no time during that period had the investigating judge considered it necessary to issue a warrant for his arrest; it was not until the Paris Indictment Division ’ s order of 8 April 1993 committing him for trial by the Assize Court that an arrest warrant had been issued."

Above all, the applicant submitted that considerations relating to the proper administration of justice did not justify an accused being denied representation. The withdrawal of all the fundamental attributes of a fair trial in itself constituted a disproportionate penalty for the accused ’ s failure to appear. In order to exercise his defence rights the accused had to be in custody: that was an unacceptable condition. The applicant also pointed out that his imprisonment had manifestly not been regarded as essential, as at no stage of the criminal investigation had an international arrest warrant been issued. Lastly, he referred to the circular issued by the Ministry of Justice on 31 December 1999 concerning the application of the Law of 23 June 1999 on improving efficiency in criminal proceedings, from which it could be seen that in all cases before a criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ) in which the proceedings have been instituted by the civil party, the accused is entitled to representation by his or her lawyer, irrespective of the sentence faced. He saw no reason why the same rule should not apply in proceedings before an assize court ( cour d ’ assises ).",

The Government pointed out, firstly, that the obligation imposed on accused persons to appear in person before the trial court was an essential guarantee for the proper administration of justice. For the most serious crimes, which were tried in the assize court and in some cases carried a life sentence, the accused ’ s attendance at his or her trial was essential, both in the accused ’ s interest and in the interest of the victims, since the assize court, through which the French people were associated with the judicial decision, was required to carry out a complete oral review of the facts of the case at the trial.",
                "The accused was called upon to present his or her version of the events and to reply to the questions of the judges, the jurors and the public prosecutor. He or she could, among other things, challenge the conclusions of the expert witnesses and the depositions of the ordinary witnesses, call witnesses for the defence and request a confrontation with the victims. Lastly, in the event of a finding of guilt, the accused ’ s presence enabled the judges to tailor the penalty to his or her personal circumstances. In the Government ’ s submission, there could be no question of the court trying a faceless defendant whom it had had no opportunity of observing or hearing, as justice could not be done solely on the basis of the submissions of a lawyer, since it was never the lawyer who went to prison or paid compensation to the victims."

The Government argued that it was vital to prevent deliberate absenteeism on the part of defendants or, at the very least, to prevent the proper functioning of the criminal-justice system being paralysed as a result. Affording an unconditional right to representation by a lawyer in criminal cases would create a serious imbalance between the parties to criminal proceedings and encourage criminals not to attend hearings or to make arrangements to take refuge overseas while their lawyers pleaded on their behalf. Such a right would, in addition, run counter to the efforts made by the international community to fight impunity for criminals accused of the most serious violations of human rights by setting up a mechanism requiring their appearance in person."

The Government stressed that Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention spoke of “assistance”, not of “representation”. As the third-party intervener had also pointed out, in French law the former term implied the presence of the defendant alongside his or her lawyer, the latter, his or her legal replacement by the lawyer. However, in criminal proceedings, Articles 274 and 317 of the Code of Criminal Procedure made an accused ’ s assistance by a lawyer compulsory, but did not permit his or her representation."

The question accordingly arose whether an accused who deliberately chose not to appear remained entitled to “defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing” within the meaning of Article 6 § 3 (c). The Government contended that he did not, owing to his refusal in such cases to comply with one of the absolute requirements of criminal procedure, as by his conduct he had prevented a genuinely adversarial hearing from being held, at least until such time as he either changed his mind and agreed to appear or was arrested. Withdrawing the accused ’ s right to assistance from counsel for as long as he or she voluntarily remained at large was thus not a disproportionate measure, as it was justified in the interests of the proper administration of justice, namely, being able to complete the investigation within a reasonable period and to avoid the operation of the statute of limitations and the deterioration of evidence."

The Government said that the instant case was the first since a series of judgments delivered in cases against Italy (notably the Colozza judgment of 1985) in which the Court had had to consider the problem of the compatibility with the Convention of criminal trials in absentia, known in French law as proceedings par contumace. In Colozza, the Court had recognised that “the impossibility of holding a trial by default may paralyse the conduct of criminal proceedings, in that it may lead, for example, to dispersal of the evidence, expiry of the time-limit for prosecution or a miscarriage of justice” (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 15, § 29)."

The Court had only found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention because Mr Colozza, who had been unaware of the proceedings, had suffered a complete and irreparable loss of his entitlement to take part in the hearing, since Italian law did not permit him to obtain a fresh determination of the merits of the charge by a court after it had heard him (ibid., p. 15, § 29 in fine ). However, it was possible to obtain a fresh determination of the merits in French law through the purge of contempt procedure prescribed in Article 639 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Indeed, it was by reference to that procedure that the European Commission of Human Rights had declared, in the only French case on trials in absentia to have been examined to date by the Convention institutions, an application manifestly ill-founded as the accused in that case had taken part in the investigation procedure and had refused to accept service of the committal order (see B. v. France, application no. 10291/83, Commission decision of 12 May 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 47, p. 59)."

The conviction then lapsed and a new trial, in which the accused ’ s right to assistance by a lawyer was fully reinstated, necessarily replaced the previous trial."

The Government noted, lastly, that as regards the right of an accused who has expressly refused to appear to be defended by a lawyer, the Court had systematically referred in its decisions concerning criminal verdicts delivered in default to the fact that it was impossible to apply for an order quashing the judgments (see the following judgments: Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A, p. 15, § 35; Lala and Pelladoah v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, Series A no. 297-A and -B, p. 13, § 33 in fine and pp. 34-35, § 40, respectively; and Van Geyseghem v. Belgium [GC], no. 26103/95, § 29, ECHR 1999-I, which concerned an application to have a judgment entered in default by a criminal court set aside). However, all those judgments had concerned proceedings before the criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ) and not before the assize court ( cour d ’ assises ) and a retrial after the contempt had been purged was distinguishable from an application to have a conviction entered in default set aside in that it was both automatic and mandatory: the accused, unlike the defendant in proceedings before the criminal court, could not acquiesce in the judgment, apply to have it set aside and then discontinue the application or, in certain cases, lodge an appeal.",
                "The Government therefore considered that, owing to the possibility of a retrial after the contempt had been purged, the fact that it was impossible for an accused to be defended by a lawyer during the proceedings in absentia did not adversely affect the exercise of the rights of the defence in an irremediable and disproportionate way; there had therefore been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (c)."

In the latter two cases, however, it added: “it is also of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal, the more so if, as is the case under Netherlands law, no objection may be filed against a default judgment given on appeal” (see Lala, cited above, p. 13, § 33, and Pelladoah, cited above, pp. 34-35, § 40). It added that the latter interest prevailed. Consequently, the fact that the defendant, in spite of having been properly summonsed, did not appear, could not – even in the absence of an excuse – justify depriving him of his right under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention to be defended by counsel (ibid.). It was for the courts to ensure that a trial was fair and, accordingly, that counsel who attended trial for the apparent purpose of defending the accused in his absence, was given the opportunity to do so (ibid., p. 14, § 34, and p. 35, § 41)."

The Court cannot, however, accept the French Government ’ s submission that the fact that it was not possible to apply to have a conviction entered in default set aside was a decisive factor for the Court in its reasoning in Lala and Pelladoah, as the clause commencing with the adverbial phrase “the more so” was added to the judgments as a subsidiary consideration (see p. 13, § 33, and pp. 34-35, § 40, respectively)."

On the other hand, there can be no question of an accused being obliged to surrender to custody in order to secure the right to be retried in conditions that comply with Article 6 of the Convention, for that would entail making the exercise of the right to a fair hearing conditional on the accused offering up his or her physical liberty as a form of guarantee (see, mutatis mutandis, Khalfaoui v.

Remedies were available to the accused before a trial in absentia, such as an appeal against his or her committal to the assize court. Committal orders cured any defects in the investigation stage, but an appeal lay to the Court of Cassation against committal orders. Subsequently, once an accused had been convicted following a trial in absentia, a special remedy replaced the appeal to the Court of Cassation, namely a retrial once the contempt had been purged. However, in any event, the Court of Cassation only ruled on points of law and had no jurisdiction to examine questions of fact or of guilt any more than it had jurisdiction to examine the severity of the sentence. There was, therefore, no reason for a review by the Court of Cassation of the lawfulness of a judicial decision that was condemned to a legal void as soon as the contempt had been purged. In such circumstances, there would be a new trial and, if convicted, the applicant would then be entitled to appeal to the Court of Cassation in the usual way.",

That was the case here: the requirement for the accused to purge his or her contempt before being able to appeal to the Court of Cassation did not infringe the essence of the right, since the possibility of an appeal subsisted throughout the period during which it was possible to purge the contempt, that is to say twenty years.

However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Haser v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 33050/96, 27 April 2000, unreported). This rule is in itself consistent with the exception authorised by paragraph 2 of Article 2 and is backed up by the French declaration regarding the interpretation of the Article, which reads: “... in accordance with the meaning of Article 2, paragraph 1, the review by a higher court may be limited to a control of the application of the law, such as an appeal to the Supreme Court ”."

The Court notes that part of the lawyers ’ fees claimed relate to complaints that were declared inadmissible by the Court in its admissibility decision of 29 February 2000. Those sums were therefore not necessarily incurred to cure a violation of the Convention found by the Court (see Nikolova, cited above, § 79).

                "This ground does not amount to a preliminary objection, seeing that the conventions prayed in aid do not provide for applications for preliminary rulings to the supervisory bodies set up to implement them.",
                "As it relates to the lawfulness of the prosecution, it must be considered, although it was not raised before any defence on the merits.",
                "The defence submissions do not allege any breach of the rules governing the procedure followed during the judicial investigation or at the trial, but it is argued in them that under the provisions of the Customs Code relied on by the prosecution a person in possession of the goods is deemed responsible for customs evasion, and all those who come within specified categories are deemed to have an interest in customs evasion, in both cases regardless of their good faith or their intention, such that these provisions provide for a presumption of guilt which makes them incompatible with the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the International Covenant, which provide that ‘ everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ’ and that ‘ everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law ’.",
                "It was pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has held that the presumption of innocence is one of the ingredients of a fair trial and that applying provisions which remove the burden of proof from the prosecution puts the defendant at a disadvantage, negates the equality of arms to his detriment, and, ultimately, deprives him of a fair trial.",
                "But while it is true that the customs authorities do not have to prove bad faith on the part of the person in possession of the smuggled goods or of the person having an interest in customs evasion, they must establish the physical fact of possession and show that the defendant in some way took part, as a person having an interest, in an offence of smuggling or of undeclared importation or that he belongs to one of the categories of those who are deemed to have a direct interest in customs evasion.",
                "It is the special nature of customs offences, which are complete as soon as the smuggled goods cross the border, that compels the legislature to define them as offences which are made out as soon as the physical acts which disclose their existence have been evidenced on French territory.",
                "The special nature of these offences does not, however, deprive the offender of any possibility of raising a defence, seeing that the law provides that a person in possession can exonerate himself by proving force majeure and that an interest in customs evasion cannot be imputed to anyone who has acted from necessity or as a result of an unavoidable mistake.",
                "It appears from the evidence in the file that Pham, who was remanded in custody on 7 January 1984 and released under judicial supervision on 6 March 1984 and was acquitted by the court below, was consistently presumed innocent and had every possibility of putting forward the grounds allowed him by the law in order to exonerate himself.",
                "That being so, there is no incompatibility in this case between the impugned provisions and the principles laid down in the conventions relied on, seeing that the customs authorities are prosecuting Pham for an offence of unlawfully importing strictly prohibited goods, namely 2,835 grams of heroin base or almost pure heroin, a commodity whose importation is strictly prohibited on account of its harmfulness to public health and of the damage its consumption causes both to the users ’ physical health and to the social order.",
                "In the face of a scourge affecting young people more particularly and which is spreading alarmingly, the impugned provisions of the Customs Code, which were applied in conformity with the rules laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure, can be seen as the response made within the constitutional framework and the limits of a European State ’ s sovereignty to offences that are particularly serious and call for appropriate special punishment.",

                "It is established that on the afternoon of 3 January 1984 Ngo, who played an important part in the importation of the heroin, was driven by Pham in his Peugeot 104 car to buy hydrochloric acid in various shops to blend the pure heroin brought into France by Cheng and Fu.",
                "Pham was present in the flat at 110 boulevard de la Chapelle at 1 p.m. when the 5kg of caffeine were delivered there by an Asian who was said by the other defendants to be the head of the trafficking network.",

Moreover, when pleadings are produced, the Court of Cassation is obliged to give a reasoned judgment, after the case has been examined by a reporting judge; whereas when an appeal is not supported in that way, the case is automatically entered in a list known as the ‘ formal list ’ because the Court of Cassation essentially considers only whether the impugned judgment is free from any formal defect; in actual fact, it also satisfies itself that the statutory maximum sentence has not been exceeded.",

However, the Court is not called upon to consider in the abstract whether Articles 369 para. 2, 373, 392 para. 1 and 399 of the Customs Code conform to the Convention.

The court set out the circumstances of the applicant ’ s arrest and took account of a cumulation of facts. It noted that during the afternoon of 3 January 1984 he had, in his own car, driven an important drug trafficker to several shops in order to buy hydrochloric acid; a little earlier, it added, he had been present in the flat where the head of the trafficking network had brought 5kg of caffeine and he had agreed to take Tran and Ngo to where the heroin was to be delivered.

With respect to statements of witnesses who proved to be unavailable for questioning in the presence of the defendant or his counsel, the Court recalls that paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps so as to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see, Sadak and Others v.

However, impossibilium nulla est obligatio; provided that the authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence in their efforts to award the defendant an opportunity to examine the witnesses in question, the witnesses ’ unavailability as such does not make it necessary to discontinue the prosecution (see, in particular, Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-A, p. 10, § 21; Scheper v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 39209/02, 5 April 2005; Mayali v. France, no. 69116/01, § 32, 14 June 2005; Haas v.

Evidence obtained from a witness under conditions in which the rights of the defence cannot be secured to the extent normally required by the Convention should, however, be treated with extreme care (see Visser v. the Netherlands, no. 26668/95, § 44, 14 February 2002; S.N. v.

                "“... The alleged breach of [the applicant ’ s] procedural rights cannot be upheld. The legal grounds for declining to hear J.S.-T. before the court are laid down in Article 337 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under that provision, the court may – even if the parties object – decline to take measures to summon a witness and confine itself to reading out the records of statements previously given by him or her as a defendant or suspect. The application of that provision is an exception to the rule of the direct examination of witnesses and does diminish the accused person ’ s defence rights, in particular in situations where there has been no prior confrontation between him and a witness whose testimony is later read out. It must however be stressed that Article 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not oblige the court to exhaust all possibilities of producing a witness from abroad at the trial, even if he or she resides in a neighbouring country. ... Of course, the trial court is empowered, apart from the application of the measure under Article 337..., to make efforts to ensure the direct examination of a witness from abroad. But those efforts make sense only if there are prospects of success. It is known – also to the author of the appeal – that the [previous] attempts made by the court in that respect were futile and that future ones would fail. As early as 1995 the Regional Court asked the Embassy of the United States of America for information as to whether J.S.-T. lived at the address that she had supplied. The reply was evasive and should be interpreted as a refusal to furnish any information on that matter. A further confirmation of the firmness of that position is found in the letter of the Polish diplomatic service (see the letter of the Consul General of the Republic of Poland in Los Angeles, p. 482).",
                "A pre-condition for securing an appearance of a witness from abroad is that the authority conducting the proceedings knows his or her address. Bearing in mind the obligation to observe all procedural rules attached to summoning a witness from a foreign country, a summons cannot be sent if his or her address is unknown or if it is clear that the address is false. It that context, it should be recalled that the applicant ’ s “private” enquiries were to no avail (see ... the letter of 7 October 1996...).",
                "In conclusion and having regard to the grounds for the appeal, the [trial] court would not have been able to satisfy the requirement of the “proper and effective summoning of the witness J.S.-T. for the trial”. Consequently, this argument is ill-founded and, indeed, this court could have stopped at this point because the appellant ’ s further arguments do not concern the court ’ s actions but the actions of the investigative authorities and, also, the appellant does not challenge the logic of the conclusion reached by the trial court. Yet there is a need to make the following remarks.",
                "First of all, J.S.-T. was released because she put up bail of PLN 10,000. Until that time, that is to say, for a month, she was in custody. The [applicant] was treated in the same way but on more favourable conditions: he was released after 17 days and the security in question was PLN 8,000.",
                "Secondly, evidence obtained under Article 337 must be assessed with a particular thoroughness. The assessment of J.S.- T. ’ s testimony must be very careful, not least because she was charged with theft of the car in question and supplied a false address. The Regional Court, did, however, manage the task. The best proof is the fact that the [appellant] does not even try to challenge the arguments relating to J.S.- T. ’ s testimony, which are presented in the reasoning of the contested judgment. It can only be recalled that the trial court took notice of the circumstances surrounding the last questioning of J.S.-T. (by the prosecutor and in the presence of her lawyer) and of the importance of those statements for her criminal responsibility. The court of first instance did not overlook the fact that those statements differed from the previous ones. There is no material proof to conclude that her statements incriminating [the applicant] were made in consequence of her agreement with the investigating authority and, in particular, that they were the price for her release. If her release can be looked on from this angle, the price for her release – although lawful – was the security in question.",
                "Apart from the above-mentioned arguments of the trial court, there is one more reason to believe J.S.-T. and not to believe [the applicant]. His subsequent statements differ in respect to a number of principal points, points that were enumerated by the trial court. That court rightly noted that [the applicant], when questioned for the first time, had no reason to present a version of events that differed from those later presented. That was decisive for the trial court when, in making a choice between [the applicant ’ s] statements and the last version presented by J.S.-T., it rejected his testimony. She also changed her statements but she had an interest in concealing the truth. Yet, if [the applicant] was not in any criminal conspiracy with other persons involved in the case, he had no reason to conceal the true circumstances capable of showing that he was not involved in the activities of those persons.",
                "The applicant ’ s letter to the court dated 17 July 1997 reinforces the conclusions reached by the Regional Court rather than supporting his own credibility.

If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Unterpertinger v.

                "55. With respect to statements of witnesses who proved to be unavailable for questioning in the presence of the defendant or his counsel, the Court recalls that paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps so as to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see, Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, § 67, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII). However, impossibilium nulla est obligatio; provided that the authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence in their efforts to award the defendant an opportunity to examine the witnesses in question, the witnesses ’ unavailability as such does not make it necessary to discontinue the prosecution (see, in particular, Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-A, p. 10, § 21; Scheper v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 39209/02, 5 April 2005; Mayali v. France, no. 69116/01, § 32, 14 June 2005; Haas v. Germany (dec.), no. 73047/01, 17 November 2005). Evidence obtained from a witness under conditions in which the rights of the defence cannot be secured to the extent normally required by the Convention should, however, be treated with extreme care (see Visser v. the Netherlands, no. 26668/95, § 44, 14 February 2002; S.N. v. Sweden, no. 34209/96, § 53, ECHR 2002-V). The defendant ’ s conviction may, in any event, not solely be based on the statements of such a witness (see, in particular, Mayali, cited above, § 32)."

Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). Thus, where a statement may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction, then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

In their reply, the Consular Department of the Embassy limited itself to stating that, according to their knowledge, J.S.-T. did not reside in Poland. Furthermore, it appears from the written reasoning of the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 13 November 1997 that the authorities made an unsuccessful inquiry concerning J.S.- T. ’ s place of residence with the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Los Angeles. However, despite those efforts, the authorities were unable to determine the actual address of J.S.-T. which was a precondition for serving a summons on the witness residing abroad.

By requesting the Embassy of the United States of America on two occasions to confirm the address of J.S.-T. and making the inquiry with the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Los Angeles, those authorities took steps to establish the address of that witness. Since their efforts were to no avail, the national courts were not in a position to serve a summons on J.S.-T. abroad or to request that she be heard as a witness by the authorities of a foreign State. Moreover, they had no alternative but to rely on the information which they could receive from sources such as the Embassy of the United States of America in Poland and the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in the USA, since J.S.-T. was a national of the United States. Under these circumstances, the Polish authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence (see, Calabro v. Italy and Germany (dec.), no. 59895/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ V)."

Thus, the courts when determining the charges against him had to have recourse to his statements given at the investigative stage of the proceedings. However, since those statements significantly varied in respect of certain crucial details, the domestic courts considered that their credibility was undermined (see, mutatis mutandis, Asch v. Austria, cited above, § 29). In addition, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts assessed J.S.- T. ’ s statements with the particular care required.

                "29. The Court has stated in the Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996 ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, p. 470, § 69) and the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997 ( Reports 1997-III, p. 711, § 52) that the use of statements made by anonymous witnesses to found a conviction is not in all circumstances incompatible with the Convention. However, if the anonymity of prosecution witnesses is maintained, the defence will be faced with difficulties which criminal proceedings should not normally involve. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that in such cases Article 6 § 1, taken together with Article 6 § 3 (d), require that the handicaps under which the defence labours be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities. With this in mind, an applicant should not be prevented from testing the anonymous witness’s reliability (also see the Kostowski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, § 42). In addition, no conviction should be based either solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements (see the aforementioned Van Mechelen and Others judgment, p. 712, §§ 54-55)."

The court found that the first and the second applicants had organised the riot and that they had also committed affray. They were sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. The third applicant was found guilty of having actively taken part in the riot and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment."

                "15. In establishing the first applicant’s guilt, the court referred to the statements of 17 anonymous witnesses who were mostly other detainees. These statements had been recorded by the prosecution during the pre-trial investigation. The secret witnesses testified that the first applicant had organised the riot. The court further referred to the statements at the pre-trial investigation of three co-accused, J, S and T, confirming the first applicant’s guilt. The Regional Court noted that J, S and T had subsequently changed their testimony, alleging inter alia that prosecutors had forced them to inculpate the first applicant. However, the court considered that the initial statements of J, S and T had been valid, and that they had only changed their evidence upon intimidation by the other defendants. The court also took account of the statements given during the trial by a complainant, a detainee belonging to “a lower caste among prisoners”. The latter had testified that the first applicant had assaulted him on 15 January 1997. The court further noted the evidence given at the trial by five members of the prison staff, alleging that the first applicant had organised the riot. The Regional Court found that on the day of the riot the first applicant had been under the influence of alcohol. In concluding that the first applicant was guilty of riot and affray, the court also mentioned indirect evidence: on-site inspection records, material evidence and expert examinations."

The anonymous statements testified that the second applicant had also been an organiser of the riot. As was the case with the first applicant, the court rejected the later statements of J, S and T, finding that their original testimonies given during the pre-trial investigation had constituted sufficient grounds for establishing the second applicant’s guilt. The court also took account of the statements delivered at the trial by two complainants who were detainees belonging to “a lower caste among prisoners”. The latter had alleged that on 15 January 1997 the second applicant had beaten other detainees, attacked members of the prison staff and barricaded the prison. Evidence along the same lines was given by six members of the prison staff summoned during the trial. The Regional Court found that during the riot the second applicant had been under the influence of alcohol. The court also noted that the second applicant’s guilt in committing riot and affray was indirectly proved by on-site inspection records, material evidence and expert examinations."

In their opinion, almost 300 inmates had taken part in the events of 15 January 1997. The applicants stated they had been victimised by the prison administration who had encouraged anonymous testimonies by other detainees, promising them favourable treatment. Furthermore, the “secret witnesses” had themselves allegedly taken part in the riot and had collaborated with the authorities in order to avoid prosecution. The prosecution also appealed against the first instance judgment, requesting more severe sentences."

It held that domestic criminal procedure permitted the first instance court to take account of evidence given by secret witnesses at the stage of pre-trial investigation, without summoning those witnesses to the trial."

It noted that the first and the second applicants had been convicted not only on the basis of the anonymous testimonies, but also by reference to the statements of the complainants and the prison staff. The Supreme Court found that the third applicant had basically been convicted by reference to the statements of anonymous witnesses. However, in the view of the cassation court, those statements had been consistent and supplementary to other evidence confirming his guilt. No procedural irregularities were found in connection with the courts’ refusal to examine the anonymous witnesses.",

Under paragraph 2 of this Article, at the stage of pre-trial investigation no one is entitled to have access to the personal details of the anonymous witness except the prosecutor or the investigator. Paragraph 3 provides that any data on the anonymous witness are a State secret. Only prosecutors, investigators and judges are entitled to have access to the personal details of that person.",

Paragraphs 2 and 3 provide a possibility for the court, of its own motion, to question the anonymous witness in the absence of the parties. Paragraph 4 of the Article states that the court may also question the witness in the parties’ presence at a non-public hearing. In such a case, the court must create acoustic and visual obstacles to prevent the parties from establishing the identity of the secret witness.",
