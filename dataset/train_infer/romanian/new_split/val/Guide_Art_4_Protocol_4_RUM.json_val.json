                "134. Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s asylum application and appeal thereto were initially rejected by the Cypriot authorities. His file, however, was subsequently re-opened for re ‑ examination in view of new information put forward by the applicant (see paragraph 17 above). When the first set of deportation and detention orders were issued on 11 June 2010 on the ground that the applicant was in Cyprus unlawfully, these proceedings were still pending (see paragraphs 17-22 above). Even though it appears that an internal note had been prepared a few days before by an officer of the Asylum Service with a negative proposal, no formal decision had been taken at this stage (see paragraph 18 above). The Reviewing Authority gave its decision on 30 September 2010 after having taken up the matter from the Asylum Service (see paragraph 22 above). The Court notes in this connection that under domestic law, proceedings before the Asylum Service and the Reviewing Authority are suspensive in nature. Consequently, as admitted by the Government in their observations of 20 September 2011 (see paragraph 182 below) a mistake had been made by the authorities as, at the time, the applicant had been in Cyprus lawfully. He should not, therefore, have been subject to deportation."

                "252. In the instant case, the Court notes that an identification procedure in respect of the 149 Syrian Kurd protesters was carried out on 11 June 2010 at the ERU headquarters. Upon arrival at the headquarters registration took place and the status of each person was then examined using computers which had been specially installed the day before. According to the Government, this procedure revealed that seventy-six adults, along with their thirty children, were staying in the Republic unlawfully after having had their asylum applications rejected or their files closed. In this connection, the Court observes that it is clear from the information before it that their asylum applications had been dealt with on an individual basis over a period of more than five years. For those in respect of which the asylum procedure had been completed, the asylum applications had either been dismissed after an examination of their personal circumstances and any evidence they had provided or the files closed for failure to attend interviews. Those who had appealed to the Reviewing Authority had had their appeals individually examined and dismissed. Separate letters had been sent out by the asylum authorities to the individuals concerned, informing them of the relevant decisions."

The authorities had carried out a background check with regard to each person before issuing the orders and separate deportation and detention orders were issued in respect of each person. Individual letters were also prepared by the Civil Registry and Migration Department informing those detained of the authorities ’ decision to detain and deport them."

As a result of this examination some of the persons arrested were allowed to return home as their immigration status was found to be in order and thus their presence on Cypriot territory was lawful. In these circumstances, the fact that all the persons concerned were taken together to the ERU headquarters and that the authorities decided to deport them in groups did not render their deportation a collective measure within the meaning attributed to that term by the Court ’ s case-law. Similarly, the fact that the deportation orders and the corresponding letters were couched in formulaic and, therefore, identical terms and did not specifically refer to the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure is not itself indicative of a collective expulsion. What is important is that every case was looked at individually and decided on its own particular facts (see Andric, cited above ). Although not expressly stated in the deportation orders and letters, the decision to deport was based on the conclusion that the person concerned was an illegal immigrant following the rejection of his or her asylum claim or the closure of the asylum file. Although a mistake was made in relation to the status of some of the persons concerned, including that of the applicant (see paragraphs 58 and 134 above) this, while unfortunate, cannot be taken as showing that there was a collective expulsion."

The Reviewing Authority noted, inter alia, that although the applicant had stated in his interview with the Asylum Service that he had been arrested and detained for three days by the Syrian military security forces, that had been in 1992, thirteen years before he decided to leave the country. With the exception of this incident, he had confirmed that he had never been harassed by the Syrian authorities and had never been persecuted. Moreover, although the applicant claimed that he had stated in his interview with the Asylum Service that he had been subjected to electric shock treatment and the “wheel treatment” whilst in detention in Syria, it transpired from the minutes of that interview that he had in fact stated that the electric cables had not functioned and had not mentioned that the wheel had been used to torture him. The Asylum Service had therefore not considered it necessary to refer him for a medical examination. The Reviewing Authority also observed that the applicant had merely claimed that he had left Syria on account of the increased pressure on the Kurdish population in that country following the events in Qamishli in 2004 and his fear of being arrested in the future, and because of his political activities as a member of the Yekiti Party. His allegations, however, had been general and vague. Further, his written asylum application had been based on other grounds.

The court could, within the context of a habeas corpus application, examine the conformity of the applicant ’ s detention with Article 15 (3) of the Directive and Article 11 (2) (f) of the Constitution. The applicant was not estopped from bringing a habeas corpus application due to the fact that he had not challenged the deportation and detention orders issued against him. Even if the lawfulness of the detention was assumed, detention for the purpose of deportation could not be indefinite and the detainee left without the right to seek his release. The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the applicant was estopped from bringing the application because his continued detention had been brought about by his own actions, that is, by his application to the Strasbourg Court for an interim measure suspending his deportation."

It could therefore be relied on in the proceedings. However, it went on to hold that the six- month period provided for in the Directive had not yet started to run. The applicant had been arrested on 11 June 2010 with a view to his deportation but had not been deported by the Government in view of the application by the Court on 12 June 2010 of Rule 39 and the issuing of an interim measure suspending his deportation. Consequently, the authorities had not been able to deport him. As the applicant himself had taken steps to suspend his deportation, the ensuing time could not be held against the Government and could not be taken into account for the purposes of Article 15 (5) and (6) of the Directive. The six-month period would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted. From that moment onwards the Government had been under an obligation in accordance with Article 15 (1) of the Directive to proceed with the applicant ’ s deportation with due diligence.

Furthermore, since filing an appeal for judicial review before the Supreme Court does not have a suspensive effect on the deportation order, deportations of asylum seekers who file such an appeal are reportedly carried out as a rule before its examination is completed.",

Thirdly, it is reported that as soon as a negative second instance decision is taken, a deportation order is faxed to the police and rejected asylum seekers are frequently arrested before they even receive the letter informing them of the negative decision of the Refugee Reviewing Authority or have a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court. Filing an appeal in any case does not have a suspensive effect on the deportation order. This raises questions concerning respect of the principle of non-refoulement. The authorities, however, have assured ECRI that the Asylum Service takes all necessary measures to ensure that the principle of non-refoulement is fully respected and that no deportation takes place before the examination of an asylum case is completed. Lastly, if legal aid is granted there is no list of lawyers specialising in asylum for asylum seekers to choose from.",

This was because although an application to the Supreme Court did not automatically suspend the deportation process, an application to suspend the deportation, including as an interim measure, had to be lodged with the Supreme Court. The suspension was not granted automatically; an applicant had to establish flagrant illegality or irreparable damage. This therefore meant that in Cyprus asylum-seekers might be at risk of forcible return to a place where they were at serious risk of human rights violations (breaching the principle of non-refoulement ) before their claim was finally determined unless the Supreme Court agreed to suspend the deportation order or, in cases where the asylum -seekers had petitioned the Court, an interim measure had been granted."

As regards the safeguards against unlawful detention, Amnesty International pointed out that it had documented several cases attesting to a failure by the police authorities to explain to immigration detainees the reasons for their detention, its possible length and the rights they had whilst in detention. Detainees and their lawyers had told Amnesty International that often they were not provided with the reasons and justification for detention. Usually, detainees were given a short letter simply referring to the legislative provisions under which their detention had been ordered and to the fact that they were being detained pending deportation. In some cases, deportation and detention orders had been handed to the individuals concerned several months into their detention. The report noted that such shortcomings were particularly common in relation to detained asylum-seekers. A large number interviewed by Amnesty International, particularly those whose applications were pending, did not appear to know how long they would be detained, even when they were aware of the grounds for their detention."

Furthermore, referring to the remedies available in Cyprus against detention, the report observed that according to lawyers, the average length of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution was one and a half years, whereas in a habeas corpus application it was one or two months. In the case of an appeal against an unsuccessful application, the length of the appeal proceedings in both cases was about five years on average. In addition, according to domestic legislation, the Minister of Interior reviewed immigration detention orders either on his or her own initiative every two months, or at a reasonable time following an application by the detainee. The Minister was also solely responsible for any decision to prolong detention for an additional maximum period of twelve months. However, the lack of automatic judicial review of the decision to detain was a cause of major concern. Referring to Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, Article 18 (2) of the Asylum Procedures Directive and Article 15 (2) of the EU Returns Directive the report concluded that because of the lack of an automatic judicial review of the administrative orders to detain, especially in cases of prolonged detention, it was clear that the procedural safeguards in Cypriot law fell short of international and regional standards."

On 11 June, 143 of the protesters, including children, were reportedly arrested during an early morning police operation. Several of them were released immediately but, according to reports, 23 were forcibly removed to Syria that day. On 14 June, the European Court of Human Rights issued interim measures requesting that Cyprus suspend the removal of the 44 who were still in detention. Seven of these were then released, either because they had pending asylum applications or were stateless. According to reports, of those remaining, 32 were forcibly removed to Syria after the European Court lifted the interim measures in their cases in September. The remaining five continued to be detained in Cyprus. Seventeen of those forcibly removed were reportedly arrested and detained upon or after their arrival in Syria.”",

For example, in both the cases of I .M. and Gebremedhin (cited above), although the Court ruled that the applicants could no longer be considered as victims in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, it found that the main complaint raised an issue of substance and that, in the particular circumstances, the applicants were still victims of the alleged violation of Article 13 taken together with Article 3.

The Court observes in this respect that the Reviewing Authority in its decision granting the applicant refugee status held that the applicant had proved, in a convincing manner, that his fear of persecution and the danger to his life in the event of his return to Syria was objectively credible because of his political activity in Cyprus (see, mutatis mutandis, S.F. and Others v.

The applicant ’ s complaint is that when he was under threat of deportation there was no effective domestic remedy in respect of his complaints under Articles 2 and 3. The Court notes in this regard that at the time the applicant was to be sent back to Syria, his asylum application was being re-examined by the authorities and that it appears from the file that his deportation was halted only because of the application by the Court of Rule 39. The decision granting the applicant refugee status was taken more than ten months after he lodged his complaints before this Court. Secondly, although the authorities ’ decision to grant the applicant asylum has removed the risk that he will be deported, that decision does not acknowledge and redress his claim under Article 13 in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 about the effectiveness of judicial review proceedings (see paragraphs 109-110 above).

The applicant relied on the court record in a recourse challenging a decision by the Reviewing Authority in a case in which deportation had taken place despite the fact that an application for a provisional order to suspend the execution of the deportation order had been filed. The person concerned had been deported the day before the hearing of the application by the Supreme Court. As a result the application was withdrawn ( Shahin Haisan Fawzy Mohammed, see paragraph 84 above). The applicant also claimed that asylum - seekers faced a number of difficulties in filing applications for provisional orders.

Where a complaint concerns allegations that the person ’ s expulsion would expose him or her to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, the effectiveness of the remedy for the purposes of Article 13 imperatively requires close scrutiny by a national authority (see Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 448, ECHR 2005 ‑ III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, § 50, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII ), as well as a particularly prompt response (see De Souza Ribeiro, cited above, § 82 ). In such a case, effectiveness also requires that the person concerned should have access to a remedy with automatic suspensive effect (see, inter alia, De Souza, cited above, § 82, 1 3 December 2012; I.M. v.

In this connection, the applicant maintained that the average time for a recourse was one and a half to two years at first instance and three to four years on appeal. The applicant criticised the data provided by the Government, arguing that there was no information concerning the methodology used to calculate the average length of such proceedings. In particular, the Government had omitted to explain whether the average length of eight months provided in the data only concerned recourses which followed their normal course, or also recourses which were eventually withdrawn or in which an application for a provisional order had been filed and then withdrawn in exchange for an “accelerated” procedure. Further, the Government had failed to provide data on the length of appeal proceedings. In this respect, the applicant asserted that there was a significant delay in the examination of appeals. He noted that he had managed to find four cases in which appeal proceedings had been decided between 2008 and 2011, the average length of which had been three years.

Four out of the five recourses had been eventually withdrawn by the persons concerned. The remaining one mainly concerned the lawfulness of the Reviewing Authority ’ s decision and not of the deportation and detention orders (see paragraph 7 9 above).

Secondly, although it was possible in view of recent amendments to the relevant domestic legislation to apply for legal aid in deportation and detention cases, this was, as in asylum cases, rarely granted (see paragraphs 72, 76 and 124 above)."

Besides these difficulties and the lack of speediness, the applicant argued that a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution was also deficient in scope, as the Supreme Court ’ s jurisdiction was limited to examining the legality of the case and not its substance. Consequently, even if successful, this procedure was not always capable of leading to the release of the person concerned. The applicant explained that in the event of an annulment by the Supreme Court of deportation and detention orders, the authorities would simply issue new deportation and detention orders, taking care to ensure that they did not commit the same errors, and the detention would continue on the basis of the new orders. A fresh recourse would then have to be filed against the new decision."

Once deportation and detention orders were issued they were only subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court through the Article 146 procedure. A habeas corpus application could only be brought in order to challenge the lawfulness of detention in terms of its length. Although the applicant had used this remedy, he had been unsuccessful (see paragraphs 50-55 above).

If he had succeeded, the relevant order would have been annulled and he would have been released. The applicant could also have filed, in the context of the recourse, an application for a provisional order seeking the suspension of his deportation. If the applicant had taken these steps he could have been released quickly. In this respect, the Government repeated their submissions under Article 13 of the Convention that, as a matter of administrative practice, if the applicant had agreed to an early hearing of the recourse and withdrawn his application for a provisional order, the authorities would have suspended the execution of the deportation order and the proceedings would have been expedited (see paragraphs 127-129 above). The lawfulness of the deportation and detention orders would have been adjudicated in a matter of weeks.

Article 5 § 4 entitles an arrested or detained person to institute proceedings bearing on the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness” of his or her deprivation of liberty. The notion of “lawfulness” under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the “lawfulness” of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1. Article 5 § 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the “lawful” detention of a person according to Article 5 § 1 (see, as a recent authority, Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 168, ECHR 2012 ). The remedies must be made available during a person ’ s detention with a view to that person obtaining speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see Louled Massoud v. Malta, no. 24340/08, § 39 July 2010 ). The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see Čonka, cited above, §§ 46 and 55). The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 § 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, amongst many authorities, Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 86, 11 October 2007, and Kadem v. Malta, no. 55263/00, § 41, 9 January 2003)."

The Court observes in this connection that the shortest time taken for the proceedings in these examples lasted one month and seventeen days and two months and twenty days respectively (see paragraphs 77-78 above). These periods are still excessive, bearing in mind the strict standards set down by the Court in its case-law (see paragraph 162 above) and the fact that they ended due to a withdrawal of the recourse by the persons concerned, without judgment having been given on the lawfulness of the decisions to deport and detain them.

Its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his liberty in an arbitrary fashion. In determining whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1, the starting -point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see, amongst many authorities, Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, § 57, 15 March 2012; Stanev, cited above, § 115, 17 January 2012; Medvedyev and Others v.

Thus, children who had spent two hours at a police station in order to be questioned without being locked up were not found to have been deprived of their liberty (see X. v. Germany, no 8819/79, cited above) nor was an applicant who had been taken to a police station for humanitarian reasons, but who was free to walk about on the premises and did not ask to leave (see Guenat v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 24722/94, Commission decision of 10 April 1995). Likewise, the Commission attached decisive weight to the fact that an applicant had never intended to leave the courtroom where he was taking part in a hearing (see E.G. v.

Bearing in mind the nature, scale and aim of the operation, the manner in which it was carried out and the overall measures taken by the authorities, it would be unrealistic to assume that the protesters were free to refuse to board the buses or to leave the police headquarters. Nor have the Government indicated that they were. It is clear that the aim of the operation was also to identify the protesters who were staying in the country unlawfully with a view to deporting them. Only those who were found to be lawfully residing in Cyprus were able to leave the premises. There was undoubtedly an element of coercion, which in the Court ’ s view is indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1. The fact that nobody had been handcuffed, put in cells or otherwise physically restrained during the period in question does not constitute a decisive factor in establishing the existence of a deprivation of liberty ( see I.I. v.

In this respect the Convention refers back essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 40, Reports 1996 ‑ III ).

On the one hand, the applicant claimed that he had not been informed orally of the grounds for his arrest and detention until 14 June 2010, that is, after more than seventy-two hours. He also stated in that connection that he had not received any information in writing. According to the Government, on the other hand, the applicant had been informed orally on 11 June 2010, once his identity had been checked, of the grounds for his arrest and detention as well as the fact that he was facing imminent deportation. They also claimed that in any event, these grounds must have become apparent to him during the identification procedure.

The Court has no reason to doubt, in the circumstances, that the applicant was informed at the time that he had been arrested on the ground of unlawful stay or that he at least understood, bearing in mind the nature of the identification process, that the reason for his arrest and detention related to his immigration status. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant filed a Rule 39 request, along with a number of other protesters, the very next day, seeking the suspension of their deportation.

In his view, the intention of the authorities had been to deal with a group of individuals, namely Syrian Kurds, collectively. This had been evident from all the circumstances of the case. The relevant meetings that had been held by the authorities concerned the handling of the situation of Syrian Kurdish failed asylum - seekers. The Minister of the Interior had given instructions to proceed with the deportation of Syrian Kurdish failed asylum-seekers with the exception of those who were Ajanib or Mahtoumeen. The police had been instructed to use discreet methods of arrest and execute the deportation orders starting with the leaders of the protest. As a result, the police had carried out an operation on 11 June 2010 against the whole group of protesters, including women and children. According to the Government only those whose asylum applications had still been pending were released. The rest had been kept in detention pending deportation. However, in reality, the asylum procedure had not been completed for the applicant as well as a number of other protesters whom the Government had intended to deport. If it had not been for the application of Rule 39 by the Court they would all have been deported. In fact, some of the protesters had been released by the authorities following the application of Rule 39 and had had their deportation orders annulled. The applicant also noted that the authorities had issued deportation orders against stateless Syrian Kurds and that some of the asylum-seekers concerned had had their asylum applications dismissed purely on procedural grounds without having benefited from an examination of the merits of their claim."

Although the instructions given by the Minister of the Interior to the authorities had been that the deportation of Kurdish failed asylum-seekers from Syria should go ahead in the normal way, these instructions could not have been enforced without the issuing of deportation and detention orders. The latter had been issued on the ground of unlawful stay and not on the basis of the aforementioned instructions.

Denmark, no. 7011/75, Commission decision of 3 October 1975).

First, in Čonka, which concerned the deportation of Slovakian nationals of Roma origin from Belgium to Slovakia, the Court found a breach because the procedure followed by the authorities did not enable it to eliminate all doubt that the expulsion might have been collective. This view was taken on the grounds that the applicants ’ arrest and consequent expulsion was ordered for the first time in a decision of 29 September 1999 on a legal basis unrelated to the requests for asylum, and in view of the large number of people of the same origin who had suffered the same fate as the applicants. The Court added that the doubt was reinforced by a series of factors:",

The Court came without difficulty to the conclusion that there had been a clear violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. It first ruled on the complicated issue of the extraterritorial applicability of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 which arose in that case. Once it had found that this provision was applicable, the violation was self-evident, as the transfer of the applicants to Libya had been carried out without any form of examination of each applicant ’ s individual situation. It was not disputed that the applicants had not undergone any identification procedure by the Italian authorities, who restricted themselves to embarking all the intercepted migrants onto military ships and disembarking them on Libyan soil. Moreover, the personnel aboard the military ships were not trained to conduct individual interviews and were not assisted by interpreters or legal advisers. In the Court ’ s view this was sufficient to rule out the existence of sufficient guarantees ensuring that the individual circumstances of each of those concerned were actually the subject of a detailed examination (§§ 185-186).",

Upon arrival at the headquarters registration took place and the status of each person was then examined using computers which had been specially installed the day before. According to the Government, this procedure revealed that seventy-six adults, along with their thirty children, were staying in the Republic unlawfully after having had their asylum applications rejected or their files closed. In this connection, the Court observes that it is clear from the information before it that their asylum applications had been dealt with on an individual basis over a period of more than five years. For those in respect of which the asylum procedure had been completed, the asylum applications had either been dismissed after an examination of their personal circumstances and any evidence they had provided or the files closed for failure to attend interviews.

In these circumstances, the fact that all the persons concerned were taken together to the ERU headquarters and that the authorities decided to deport them in groups did not render their deportation a collective measure within the meaning attributed to that term by the Court ’ s case-law. Similarly, the fact that the deportation orders and the corresponding letters were couched in formulaic and, therefore, identical terms and did not specifically refer to the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure is not itself indicative of a collective expulsion. What is important is that every case was looked at individually and decided on its own particular facts (see Andric, cited above ). Although not expressly stated in the deportation orders and letters, the decision to deport was based on the conclusion that the person concerned was an illegal immigrant following the rejection of his or her asylum claim or the closure of the asylum file. Although a mistake was made in relation to the status of some of the persons concerned, including that of the applicant (see paragraphs 58 and 134 above) this, while unfortunate, cannot be taken as showing that there was a collective expulsion."

During the period from the end of September 2006 to the end of January 2007 identity checks of Georgian nationals residing in Russia were carried out in the streets, markets and other workplaces and at their homes. Many were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations. After a period of custody in police stations, they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court, which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from Russian territory. Subsequently, after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test, they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time, and then taken by bus to various airports in Moscow, and expelled to Georgia by aeroplane. Some of the Georgian nationals against whom expulsion orders were issued left the territory of the Russian Federation by their own means (for further details as to the background of the case see Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], no. 132 55/07, § 45, ECHR 2014).",

The applicants submit that the inter-State case was brought by the Government of Georgia but not by the individual applicants and that therefore the Court only decided on violations of rights of unnamed nationals of the Republic of Georgia but did not give a ruling on individual violations of rights guaranteed by the Convention (see Georgia v.

It is therefore for the parties to substantiate their factual arguments by providing the Court with the necessary evidence. Whereas the Court is responsible for establishing the facts, it is up to the parties to provide active assistance by supplying it with all the relevant information. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account ( Lisnyy and others v.

In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events, the Court is inevitably confronted with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court when establishing the facts. As to facts in dispute, the Court reiterates its jurisprudence requiring a standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” in its assessment of evidence. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact ( Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, § 95, 18 December 2012, with further references)."

Under certain circumstances the Court has borne in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining evidence and the fact that often little evidence can be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications ( Saydulkhanova v. Russia, no. 25521/10, § 56, 25 June 2015). According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, in these cases it is for the applicant to make only a prima facie case and to adduce appropriate evidence. If, in response to such allegations made by the applicants, the Government then fail to disclose crucial documents to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn. The prima facie threshold is reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants ’ submission to the Court and to domestic authorities, and other evidence (see Aslakhanova, cited above, §§ 97, 99, with further references). However, where the applicants fail to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof can not be reversed (see Saydulkhanova, cited above, § 56, with further references )."

In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that, again in the context of a complaint under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, it has required proof in the form of concordant inferences before the burden of proof is shifted to the Government (see El-Masri, cited above, § 153, with further references).",
