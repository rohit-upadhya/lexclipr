In determining the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of foreigners in airport transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants, the factors taken into consideration by the Court may be summarised as follows: i) the applicants’ individual situation and their choices, ii) the applicable legal regime of the respective country and its purpose, iii) the relevant duration, especially in the light of the purpose and the procedural protection enjoyed by applicants pending the events, and iv) the nature and degree of the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants (see the cases cited in the preceding three paragraphs)."

                "140. The Court observes that all four applicants entered the airport involuntarily, but without any involvement of the Russian authorities, either because they had been denied entry into the country they wanted to go to or because they had been deported to Russia. Compelled by the circumstances, they all decided to seek asylum in Russia. While this fact in itself does not exclude the possibility of the applicants finding themselves in a situation of de facto deprivation of liberty after having entered, the Court considers that it is a relevant consideration, to be looked at in the light of all other circumstances of the case."

            [
                "141. It is true that in a number of cases the Court stated that detention might violate Article 5 of the Convention even though the person concerned had agreed to it and emphasised that the right to liberty is too important for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gave himself up to be taken into detention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 65, Series A no. 12; I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, §§ 84-87, 9 June 2005; Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 48, 9 November 2010; Venskutė v. Lithuania, no. 10645/08, § 72, 11 December 2012; and Buzadji v. Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, §§ 106-10, 5 July 2016). Those cases, however, concerned situations where the law provided for deprivation of liberty or situations where the applicants had complied with an obligation, such as, among others, to enter a prison or a police station or submit to house arrest. The circumstances are not the same, in the Court’s view, where the applicants – as in the present case – had no relevant prior link to the State concerned and no obligation to which they acquiesced but requested admission to that State’s territory of their own initiative and sought asylum there. In such cases the starting point regarding the applicants’ individual position vis-à-vis the authorities is entirely different."
            ],
            [
                "142. In the present case, having regard to the known facts about the applicants and their respective journeys and, notably, the fact that they did not arrive in Russia because of a direct and immediate danger for their life or health but rather due to specific circumstances of their travel routes, there is no doubt that they entered the Sheremetyevo airport involuntarily, but without the Russian authorities being involved. It is therefore clear that, at all events, the Russian authorities were entitled to do the necessary verifications and examine their claims before deciding whether or not to admit them.",

                "143. Second, it is also relevant that the rationale and purpose of the domestic legal regime applicable to the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone was to put in place a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit the asylum-seekers to Russia (see paragraphs 99 and 100 above). Albeit not decisive in itself, it is relevant to note that the Russian authorities did not seek to deprive the applicants of their liberty and that they denied them entry at once (see paragraphs 14, 20, 29 and 39 above). The applicants remained in the transit zone essentially because they awaited the outcome of their asylum proceedings (see paragraphs 46-96 above)."

            [
                "144. The right of States to control the entry of foreigners into their territory necessarily implies that admission authorisation may be conditional on compliance with relevant requirements. Therefore, absent other significant factors, the situation of an individual applying for entry and waiting for a short period for the verification of his or her right to enter cannot be described as deprivation of liberty imputable to the State, since in such cases the State authorities have undertaken vis-à-vis the individual no other steps than reacting to his or her wish to enter by carrying out the necessary verifications (see, mutatis mutandis, Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47; see also Mahdid and Haddar, cited above, where the applicants’ asylum requests were dismissed in an airport transit zone within three days and the Court found that there had been no deprivation of liberty (taking into consideration additional factors, such as that the applicants were not under constant police control)."

It is further relevant whether, in line with the purpose of the applicable legal regime, procedural guarantees concerning the processing of the applicants’ asylum claims and domestic provisions fixing the maximum duration of their stay in the transit zone existed and whether they were applied in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "146. On the facts, the Court notes that the respondent Government were unable to point at any domestic provisions fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone and that furthermore in disregard of the Russian domestic rules granting every asylum-seeker the right to be issued with an examination certificate and to be placed in temporary accommodation facilities pending examination of the asylum application (see paragraphs 99 and 100 above; compare Riad and Idiab, cited above, § 101), the applicants were essentially left to their own devices in the transit zone. The Russian authorities did not acknowledge that they were in any manner responsible for the applicants, thereby leaving the latter in a legal limbo without any possibility of challenging the measures restricting their liberty (see paragraph 44 above). While in the transit zone, all four applicants had little information regarding the outcome of their respective applications for refugee status and temporary asylum (see paragraphs 41-44 above)."

                "147. In the Court’s case-law concerning confinement of aliens in an immigration context, the duration of the relevant restriction on movement and the link between the actions of the authorities and the restricted freedom may be elements affecting the classification of the situation as amounting to deprivation of liberty or not (see, mutatis mutandis, Amuur, cited above, § 43; Gahramanov, cited above, §§ 35-47; and Mahdid and Haddar, cited above). However, as long as the applicant’s stay in the transit zone does not exceed significantly the time needed for the examination of an asylum request and there are no exceptional circumstances, the duration in itself should not affect the Court’s analysis on the applicability of Article 5 in a decisive manner. That is particularly so where the individuals, while waiting for the processing of their asylum claims, benefitted from procedural rights and safeguards against excessive waiting periods. The presence of domestic legal regulation limiting the length of stay in the transit zone is of significant importance in this regard."
            ],
            [
                "148. In the present case the processing and subsequent judicial examination of the applicants’ respective cases was anything but speedy, as Mr Z.A. spent seven months and nineteen days in the transit zone awaiting the outcome of his asylum proceedings (see paragraphs 46-55 above); Mr M.B. five months and one day (see paragraphs 57-64 above); Mr A.M. one year, nine months and at least twenty-eight days (see paragraph 66-82 above); and Mr Yasien seven months and twenty-two days (see paragraphs 83-95 above). The Court thus considers that the applicants’ situation was very seriously influenced by delays and inactions of the Russian authorities which were clearly attributable to them and were not justified by any legitimate reasons."
            ],
            [
                "149. The Court would add that the case file contains no indication that the applicants in the present case failed to comply with the legal regulations in place or did not act in good faith at any time during their confinement in the transit zone or at any stage of the domestic legal proceedings by, for instance, complicating the examination of their asylum cases (see, by contrast, Mahdid and Haddar, cited above, where the applicants remained in the international zone of an airport after the rejection of their request for asylum and destroyed their documents in an attempt to force the Austrian authorities to accept them).",

The individuals staying at the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone were not permitted to leave in the direction of the remaining territory of Russia, the country where the zone was located (compare and contrast Mogoş, cited above). This is unsurprising having regard to the very purpose of the transit zone as a waiting area while the authorities decided whether to formally admit asylum-seekers to Russia."
            ],
            [
                "151. The Court further observes, and this was not in dispute between the parties, that even though the applicants were largely left to their own devices within the perimeter of the transit zone, the restrictions on their liberty were nevertheless substantial given that the whole area was under the permanent control of the BSG, a branch of the FSB. The Court finds that, overall, the size of the area and the manner in which it was controlled were such that the applicants’ freedom of movement was restricted to a very significant degree, in a manner similar to that characteristic of certain types of light regime detention facilities."
            ],

            [
                "153. The Court recalls its reasoning in the case of Amuur (cited above), where it stated that “the mere fact that it is possible for asylum-seekers to leave voluntarily the country where they wish to take refuge cannot exclude a restriction on liberty” and noted that the possibility to leave “becomes theoretical if no other country offering protection comparable to the protection they expect to find in the country where they are seeking asylum is inclined or prepared to take them in” (ibid ., § 48)."
            ],
            [
                "154. In this regard, the Court observes that unlike in land border transit zones, in this particular case leaving the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone would have required planning, contacting aviation companies, purchasing tickets and possibly applying for a visa depending on the destination. The Court considers that the Government have failed to substantiate their assertion that despite these obstacles “the applicants were free to leave Russia at any time and go wherever they wished”. The practical and real possibility for the applicants to leave the airport transit zone and do so without a direct threat for their life or health, as known by or brought to the attention of the authorities at the relevant time, must be convincingly shown to exist."
            ],
            [
                "155. In the light of this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to address the parties’ arguments relating to the merits of the applicants’ asylum requests. The Convention cannot be read as linking in such a manner the applicability of Article 5 to a separate issue concerning the authorities’ compliance with Article 3 (see Ilias and Ahmed [GC], no. 47287/15, §§ 244-46, 21 November 2019).",

                "156. The Court thus finds that, having regard in particular to the lack of any domestic legal provisions fixing the maximum duration of the applicants’ stay, the largely irregular character of the applicants’ stay in the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone, the excessive duration of such stay and considerable delays in domestic examination of the applicants’ asylum claims, the characteristics of the area in which the applicants were held and the control to which they were subjected during the relevant period of time and the fact that the applicants had no practical possibility of leaving the zone, the applicants were deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5. Article 5 § 1 is therefore applicable.",

The Russian authorities did not acknowledge that they were in any manner responsible for the applicants, thereby leaving the latter in a legal limbo without any possibility of challenging the measures restricting their liberty (see paragraph 44 above).

It is also a value of civilisation closely bound up with respect for human dignity, part of the very essence of the Convention. The prohibition in question is absolute, for no derogation from it is permissible even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation or in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 158 with further references).

This being so, referring to its well-established standard of proof in conditions-of-detention cases (see Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, § 128, 20 October 2016; see also Ananyev and Others v.

On the basis of the available material, the Court can clearly see that the conditions of the applicants’ stay in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport were unsuitable for an enforced long-term stay. In its view, a situation where a person not only has to sleep for months at a stretch on the floor in a constantly lit, crowded and noisy airport transit zone without unimpeded access to shower or cooking facilities and without outdoor exercise, but also has no access to medical or social assistance (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above) falls short of the minimum standards of respect for human dignity."

The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement. Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by Minsk Group diplomats and a number of meetings between the Presidents of the two countries in 2009, the process lost momentum in 2010. So far the parties to the conflict have not signed a formal agreement on the Basic Principles."

                "“The OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs conducted a Field Assessment Mission to the seven occupied territories of Azerbaijan surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) from October 7-12, 2010, to assess the overall situation there, including humanitarian and other aspects. The Co-Chairs were joined by the Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and his team, which provided logistical support, and by two experts from the UNHCR and one member of the 2005 OSCE Fact-Finding Mission. This was the first mission by the international community to the territories since 2005, and the first visit by UN personnel in 18 years.",
                "In travelling more than 1,000 kilometers throughout the territories, the Co-Chairs saw stark evidence of the disastrous consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the failure to reach a peaceful settlement. Towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins. While no reliable figures exist, the overall population is roughly estimated as 14,000 persons, living in small settlements and in the towns of Lachin and Kelbajar. The Co-Chairs assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since 2005. The settlers, for the most part ethnic Armenians who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in Azerbaijan, live in precarious conditions, with poor infrastructure, little economic activity, and limited access to public services. Many lack identity documents. For administrative purposes, the seven territories, the former NK Oblast, and other areas have been incorporated into eight new districts.",
                "The harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the Co ‑ Chairs that the status quo is unacceptable, and that only a peaceful, negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of a better, more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now. The Co-Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas. They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents. The Co-Chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the NK conflict, and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement.”"

We express our deep regret that, rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests, the parties have continued to seek one-sided advantage in the negotiation process.",
                "We continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over the last four years must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. These elements should be seen as an integrated whole, as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a balanced solution.",
                "We reiterate that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace, stability, and reconciliation, opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation. The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict. A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region, resulting in loss of life, more destruction, additional refugees, and enormous financial costs. We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the Helsinki principles, particularly those relating to the non-use of force or the threat of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict. The leaders should prepare their people for peace, not war.",
                "Our countries stand ready to assist the sides, but the responsibility for putting an end to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains with them. We strongly believe that further delay in reaching a balanced agreement on the framework for a comprehensive peace is unacceptable, and urge the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to focus with renewed energy on the issues that remain unresolved.”",

Other western journalists had reported to HRW researchers that they had seen eight more buses full of Armenian army soldiers heading for Azerbaijani territory from Armenia.

Hundreds of thousands of people are still displaced and live in miserable conditions. Considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan are still occupied by Armenian forces, and separatist forces are still in control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.",

The Assembly expresses its concern that the military action, and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing. The Assembly reaffirms that independence and secession of a regional territory from a state may only be achieved through a lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of such territory to another state. The Assembly reiterates that the occupation of foreign territory by a member state constitutes a grave violation of that state ’ s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of conflict to return to their homes safely and with dignity.”"

                "“[Nagorno-Karabakh] may be the world ’ s most militarized society. The highly trained and equipped Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army is primarily a ground force, for which Armenia provides much of the backbone. A Nagorno-Karabakh official told Crisis Group it has some 20,000 soldiers, while an independent expert [U.S. military analyst Richard Giragosian, July 2005] estimated 18,500. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 reservists allegedly could be mobilised. Based on its population, Nagorno ‑ Karabakh cannot sustain such a large force without relying on substantial numbers of outsiders. According to an independent assessment [by Mr Giragosian], there are 8,500 Karabakh Armenians in the army and 10,000 from Armenia. ...",
                "Nevertheless, many conscripts and contracted soldiers from Armenia continue to serve in [ Nagorno- Karabakh]. The (de facto) minister of defence admits his forces have 40 per cent military contract personnel, including citizens of Armenia. He claims that no Armenian citizens are unwillingly conscripted and says 500,000 Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh descent live in Armenia, some of whom serve in the Nagorno ‑ Karabakh forces. Former conscripts from Yerevan and other towns in Armenia have told Crisis Group they were seemingly arbitrarily sent to Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the occupied districts immediately after presenting themselves to the recruitment bureau. They deny that they ever volunteered to go to Nagorno ‑ Karabakh or the adjacent occupied territory. They were not paid a bonus for serving outside Armenia, and they performed military service in Nagorno-Karabakh uniform, under Nagorno-Karabakh military command. Young Armenian recruits ’ opposition to serving in Nagorno-Karabakh has increased, which may help explain an apparent decrease in the numbers being sent to [ Nagorno- Karabakh].",
                "There is a high degree of integration between the forces of Armenia and Nagorno ‑ Karabakh. Senior Armenian authorities admit they give substantial equipment and weaponry. Nagorno-Karabakh authorities also acknowledge that Armenian officers assist with training and in providing specialised skills. However, Armenia insists that none of its army units are in Nagorno-Karabakh or the occupied territories around it.”",

I meant that approximately that number of volunteers are involved in the Nagorno - Karabakh armed forces from Armenia and other States according to my calculations. As for the number I mentioned, I can ’ t insist that it ’ s correct as it is confidential information and nobody has the exact number.

More specifically, none of the examples of cases given by the Government in their observations to the Chamber in July 2007 related to the right to return to enjoy properties or private and family life.

Read in conjunction with the Government ’ s previous observations, where these remedies had not been mentioned and where the return of and compensation to displaced persons were conditioned on a comprehensive and final conflict - resolution agreement, the 2012 submissions lacked credibility.

The Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV). The Court cannot emphasise enough that it is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdiction (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 and 7 others, § 69, ECHR 2010, and Kazali and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), nos. 49247/08 and 8 others, § 132, 6 March 2012)."

                "“65. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article [35] of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights ...",
                "66. Under Article [35] normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness ...",
                "Article [35] also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used ...",
                "67. However, there is, as indicated above, no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. In addition, according to the ‘ generally recognised rules of international law ’ there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal ... The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective ...",
                "68. In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement ... One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.",
                "69. The Court would emphasise that the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article [35] must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism ... It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case ... This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants.”",

The reason for this is that the Government have not shown that there is a remedy – in Armenia or in the “NKR” – capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints. The legal provisions referred to by them are of a general nature and do not address the specific situation of dispossession of property as a result of armed conflict, or in any other way relate to a situation similar to that of the applicants. As regards the domestic judgments submitted by way of example in June 2007 (see paragraph 109 above), none of them relate to claims concerning the loss of homes or property by persons displaced in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

Given such a denial of involvement or jurisdiction, it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to bring claims for restitution or compensation before the Armenian courts and authorities. Regard must further be had to the political and general context. As a consequence of the war, virtually all Azerbaijanis have left the disputed territories. No political solution of the conflict has been reached. Rather, the hostile rhetoric between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan appears to have intensified, ceasefire breaches are recurrent and the military build-up in the region has escalated in recent years. In these circumstances, it is not realistic that any possible remedy in the unrecognised “NKR” entity could in practice afford displaced Azerbaijanis effective redress."

The original statements were made from memory, without access to documents, and it was therefore the information contained in the passports that was correct and should be taken into account. The applicants further asserted that the passports constituted secondary evidence of their possessions. In addition, the sixth applicant had submitted primary evidence in the form of an abstract from the session protocol of the Soviet of People ’ s Deputies of Lachin District of 29 January 1974 that contained the decision to allocate land to him. When they fled, they had not had the time to take all of their papers with them. Furthermore, there had not been a centralised land register at the time from which they could have obtained further documents."

Both rights allegedly constituted possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, the 1991 Law on property in Azerbaijan made reference to a land plot as the object of individual ownership and thus gave the applicants a legitimate expectation of becoming owners of land."

The Government contended that, with the exception of the sixth applicant, the applicants had not submitted any evidence with their application that could prove that they in fact had any property, let alone that the property was located on the territory claimed and that they had owned it at the relevant time. In the Government ’ s view, it was remarkable that, although they all claimed to have fled empty-handed, the technical passports of the other five applicants had later appeared out of nowhere. Furthermore, the statements of friends and neighbours submitted to the Court amounted to no more than hearsay. In respect of all the applicants, the Government maintained that they had failed to prove “beyond reasonable doubt” that they were the persons they claimed to be, that they had resided in the territories specified by them or that they owned the property in question. In particular, the documents provided by them contained numerous contradictions and inaccuracies. For instance, the second applicant had first claimed to have lived in the village of Chirag and had then changed this to Chiragli. Moreover, most of the technical passports submitted as proof of ownership gave different figures with regard to the size of the houses to the figures stated by the applicants themselves. The Government also claimed that a technical passport is a document showing the technical condition of a building and nothing else, unless its origin and provenance is established."

                "124. The Government further questioned whether the applicants had ever held a right to the alleged properties that had been recognised under the law in force in 1992 or certified by the appropriate authority. In particular, under the socialist system of the USSR before 1991, land was under the exclusive ownership of the State. While the 1991 Law on property recognised the possibility of private ownership, it did not transfer ownership of land occupied by individuals to them. With respect to individual land users and lessees, the legislation set out that their rights were formalised through a certificate, which was registered in a land register kept by the local Soviet of People ’ s Deputies. Thus, no rights to land could be asserted without such a registered certificate. Furthermore, the Azerbaijani 1992 Land Code stipulated that the rights of a user or lessee could be extinguished following a failure to use the land for a period of two years. As the applicants had not returned to the district of Lachin since 1992, the Government presumed that their alleged rights had been terminated before Armenia became subject to the jurisdiction of the Court in 2002. Furthermore, the applicants ’ claimed legitimate expectation to become owners of land was no longer a realistic expectation in 2002. Furthermore, before that date, the applicants ’ alleged property had been allocated to other individuals, with their names recorded on the land register in accordance with the laws of the “NKR”. Thus, the applicants had no “existing possessions” but were merely claimants seeking to have their property restored or to receive compensation. The Government maintained that no domestic legislation or judicial decision existed which gave rise to a legitimate expectation of such restitution or compensation. However, in the same observations, the Government stated that the “NKR” had not adopted any legal act that deprived the applicants of the right to enter the territory of Lachin or of the right to peacefully enjoy their property.",

At the material time, it was impossible to obtain property documents as the records had been kept by the local authorities, and their archives had most likely been destroyed. Nevertheless, a technical passport was classified as an “inventory-technical” document that served to indirectly establish the right to an individual house where the original document was missing. This document constituted secondary evidence of title to a house or a plot of land if its text directly referred to documents confirming the property rights. Such a reference was included in the applicants ’ technical passports. Thus, considered together with the witness statements and building invoices submitted, they demonstrated that the applicants owned individual houses and had the right to use the land plots allotted to them.

All land transactions were prohibited, but plots of land were allotted by decision of the local authority, the Soviet of People ’ s Deputies, to citizens for their use for a definite or indefinite period of time, free of charge. The right of use, which was an inheritable title, was granted for purposes such as individual housing, namely the construction of privately owned houses, as well as pasture, haymaking and farming.

The Turkish Government did not call into question the validity of the applicant ’ s title, but argued that she had lost ownership of the land by virtue of Article 159 of the 1985 Constitution of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”) which declared all abandoned immovable properties to be the property of the “TRNC”. The Court, having regard to the lack of recognition of the “TRNC” as a State by the international community, did not attribute any legal validity to the provision and considered that the applicant could not be deemed to have lost title to her property as a result of it (§§ 42-47)."

As explained by the applicant in Solomonides v. Turkey (no. 16161/90, § 31, 20 January 2009), his titles of ownership had been registered at the District Lands Office. However, at the time of the Turkish military intervention he had been forced to flee and had been unable to take with him the title deeds. The Cypriot authorities had reconstructed the Land Books and had issued certificates of affirmation of title. These certificates were the best evidence available in the absence of the original records or documents. It is noteworthy that in Saveriades v. Turkey (no. 16160/90, 22 September 2009) the reasons why the applicant could not submit the original title deeds were specifically taken into account. The applicant argued that he had been forced to leave his premises, where the documents were held, in great haste and had subsequently been unable to return there or otherwise retrieve the title deeds. The Court accepted that the documents submitted by the applicant (such as a sale contract, ownership certificates and a building permit) provided prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the properties in issue, and continued (§ 18):",

The Court considered that it was not necessary to decide whether or not in the absence of title deeds the applicants had rights of property under domestic law. The question was rather whether the overall economic activities carried out by the applicants constituted “possessions” coming within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The Court further notes that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common lands in the village, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from stockbreeding and tree-felling.

Accordingly, as well as physical goods, certain rights and interests constituting assets may also be regarded as ‘ property rights ’, and thus as ‘ possessions ’ for the purposes of this provision ...

Article 10.3 of the Housing Code provided for the ownership of houses, and the Land Code, notably Articles 4, 25, 27 and 28, laid down the rules and procedures for the allocation of land to individuals for their use. Consequently, the houses that the applicants inhabited in the district of Lachin were part of their personal property, whereas they only had a “right of use” of the plots of land on which these houses stood. As has already been mentioned (see paragraph 138), the moveable property – livestock, carpets, cars – that the applicants claimed to have possessed (the rights to which were also protected by the laws of the Azerbaijan SSR) is likely to have been destroyed during the military attack on Lachin or in the subsequent years.

The Government further claimed that, in any event, the land had been allocated to other individuals in accordance with the laws of the “NKR”.

In any event, the Court notes that the ‘ NKR ’ is not recognised as a State under international law by any countries or international organisations.

These credits constituted financial assistance which contributed to Armenia ’ s effective control over Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the surrounding territories.

In their view, effective control implied detailed direction or control over specific operations of the controlled entity, with the capacity to start and stop them as well as to determine their course. Pointing out that extraterritorial jurisdiction was an exception to the principle that a State had jurisdiction over its own territory, the Government maintained that the burden of proving such control was on the applicants, that the burden of proof should be of a high standard, and that they could not discharge this burden, as evidence rather showed that there was no Armenian influence, let alone control, over the “NKR”. The Government was of the opinion that Al-Skeini (cited above) was not relevant to the present circumstances as that judgment relied on “State agent authority and control” which did not apply to the facts of the present case. Furthermore, the merely supportive role played by Armenia in relation to the “NKR” was fundamentally different from the number of Turkish soldiers involved in northern Cyprus or the size of the Russian military arsenal present in Transdniestria (as established in Loizidou and Ilaşcu and Others, both cited above), and did not, under any reasonable definition, amount to effective control."

The military actions were actually against the interests of the Government, which was at the time negotiating a ceasefire agreement with the Azerbaijani leaders; a meeting had been held from 8 to 9 May in Tehran.

Furthermore, the Armenian authorities had not adopted any legal acts or programmes or taken other official steps to get involved in the military actions, which had been entirely carried out by the “NKR” defence force, established in early 1992 following the enactment of the “NKR” Law on conscription. It had been assisted by the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories as well as volunteers of Armenian origin from various countries. Armenia had only been involved in the war in so far as it had defended itself against Azerbaijani attacks on its territory within the recognised borders of Armenia.

In the district of Lachin there were no military units at all, as Lachin was at a considerable distance from the “NKR” border with Azerbaijan and there was therefore no need to keep units there. It could not be ruled out that some Armenian nationals may have served in the “NKR” defence force on a contractual and voluntary basis. Moreover, according to the 1994 Agreement on Military Cooperation between the Governments of the Republic of Armenia and the “ Republic of Nagorno ‑ Karabakh ” (“the 1994 Military Agreement”), draftees from Armenia, upon their consent, may perform their military service in the “NKR” and vice versa, as well as participate in military exercises organised in the “NKR” or in Armenia. The legal proceedings involving Armenian conscripts who had served in the “NKR” had a simple explanation: under the Agreement, criminal charges against Armenian conscripts were dealt with by the Armenian prosecutors and any such charges against Karabakhi conscripts were dealt with by the “NKR” authorities. However, only a small number of Armenian volunteer conscripts had served in Nagorno-Karabakh where they had moreover been under the direct command of the “NKR” defence force."

Armenia had not given any economic help to the “NKR” other than, for several years, providing the “NKR” with long-term loans for the implementation of specific projects, including the rebuilding of schools and other educational institutions and the provision of financial assistance to the families of soldiers killed in action. Such help had been provided by other countries as well. Moreover, the Fund played a great role in the development of the “NKR”. Its main mission was to provide financial assistance to Armenia and the “NKR”, using resources collected by the Armenian diaspora. While there were Armenian representatives on the Board of Trustees, the majority of the Board ’ s members were from the Armenian diaspora and the “NKR”. The Fund ’ s agenda was not set by the government; often the donors themselves decided to which projects their money should go. The only governmental assistance to the Fund was the provision of rent-free offices in a government building in Yerevan. Thus, it was not an instrument of control, but a non-political, charitable organisation, which had provided USD 111 million to the “NKR” for building schools and hospitals, reconstructing roads and villages, assisting with cultural events and subsidising work and education for the poor. Resources were also provided by other funds and international organisations. Charity and international investments in the “NKR” annually accounted for USD 20-30 million and 30-40 million respectively."

It exercised control and jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh and the territories surrounding it. Only the laws and other legal acts of the “NKR” were applied on these territories, and it was normal for the “NKR” to have borrowed or adopted some laws from Armenia. The “NKR” had its own court system which operated entirely independently. Political elections were held in the “NKR”, and the fact that some individuals had been in high political office in both the “NKR” and Armenia was nothing out of the ordinary in the early days of both countries ’ independence. Armenia ’ s political support was limited to taking part in the settlement negotiations conducted within the framework of the Minsk Group, with a view to regulating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. “NKR” passports were issued to its citizens, who had political rights and civil duties on the basis of their citizenship. Armenian passports had been issued only to some residents of Nagorno-Karabakh so as to enable them to travel abroad. Several currencies, not only the Armenian dram, were used in the “NKR”."

Evidence since 2002 demonstrated that Armenia and the “NKR” were friendly countries, with much in common and with close economic and social links, a military alliance and a shared ethnicity. Armenia had had some influence in so far as it had, from time to time, given financial and other assistance to the “NKR”. Furthermore, as a good neighbour and ally, it had helped to maintain, from its end, the humanitarian corridor in the district of Lachin.

They invoked statements by various international and non-governmental organisations and the US Department of State, as well as many political leaders in claiming that, at the beginning of the 1990s, Armenian forces, fighting beside separatist Karabakhi forces, had occupied Nagorno-Karabakh as well as Lachin and the other surrounding territories and that these territories continued to be occupied by Armenia, which had soldiers stationed there. In the latter respect, they referred to Harutyunyan v. Armenia (no. 36549/03, ECHR 2007-III ) and Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan v. Armenia ( ( dec.), nos. 36894/04 and 3521/07, 11 October 2007 ). The “NKR” was not an independent State, as claimed by the respondent Government, but a subordinate local administration surviving by virtue of the military and other support afforded by Armenia. Allegedly, it was not conceivable that the “NKR” defence force would exist in any recognisable form without the extensive support of Armenia, expressed, for example, in weapons, equipment, training and, above all, the constant provision of a highly significant percentage – if not an actual majority – of soldiers based in the occupied territories."

They pointed, inter alia, to the close political links between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia which, moreover, had a strong personal element at the highest level. Furthermore, economic aid provided by Armenia was essential for the “NKR”. The Government referred to the Fund, which allegedly had to be seen as an organ of the Armenian State in relation to the aid given to Nagorno-Karabakh. The Fund had had a significant impact in the “NKR”, not just financially but also socially. Allegedly, it was carried by political will, reinforcing Nagorno-Karabakh ’ s economic dependency on Armenia and further integrating the “NKR” into Armenia. They also referred to the Armenian State loans, which constituted a major part of the “NKR” budget.

The principles have been set out in several cases, including Ilaşcu and Others (cited above, §§ 311-19), Al-Skeini and Others (cited above, §§ 130-39) and Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia ([GC], nos. 43370/04 and 2 others, 19 October 2012 ). The relevant passages of Catan and Others read as follows.",
                "“103. The Court has established a number of clear principles in its case-law under Article 1. Thus, as provided by this Article, the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State is confined to ‘ securing ’ ( ‘ reconnaître ’ in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own ‘ jurisdiction ’ (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 86, Series A no. 161, and Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others [GC] (dec.), no. 52207/99, § 66, ECHR 2001-XII). ‘ Jurisdiction ’ under Article 1 is a threshold criterion. The exercise of jurisdiction is a necessary condition for a Contracting State to be able to be held responsible for acts or omissions imputable to it which give rise to an allegation of the infringement of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 311, ECHR 2004-VII, and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 130, 7 July 2011 ).",
                "104. A State ’ s jurisdictional competence under Article 1 is primarily territorial (see Soering, cited above, § 86; Banković and Others, cited above, §§ 61 [and] 67; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 131). Jurisdiction is presumed to be exercised normally throughout the State ’ s territory ( see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312; Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 139, ECHR 2004-II). Conversely, acts of the Contracting States performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 only in exceptional cases ( see Banković and Others, cited above, § 67, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above § 131).",
                "105. To date, the Court has recognised a number of exceptional circumstances capable of giving rise to the exercise of jurisdiction by a Contracting State outside its own territorial boundaries. In each case, the question whether exceptional circumstances exist which require and justify a finding by the Court that the State was exercising jurisdiction extra-territorially must be determined with reference to the particular facts ( see Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 132).",
                "106. One exception to the principle that jurisdiction under Article 1 is limited to a State ’ s own territory occurs when, as a consequence of lawful or unlawful military action, a Contracting State exercises effective control of an area outside that national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State ’ s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration ( see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 62, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 76, ECHR 2001-IV; Banković and Others, cited above, § 70; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 314-16; Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138). Where the fact of such domination over the territory is established, it is not necessary to determine whether the Contracting State exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration. The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the Contracting State ’ s military and other support entails that State ’ s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights ( see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, §§ 76-77, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138).",
                "107. It is a question of fact whether a Contracting State exercises effective control over an area outside its own territory. In determining whether effective control exists, the Court will primarily have reference to the strength of the State ’ s military presence in the area (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, §§ 16 and 56, and Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 387). Other indicators may also be relevant, such as the extent to which its military, economic and political support for the local subordinate administration provides it with influence and control over the region (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 388-94, and Al ‑ Skeini and Others, cited above, § 139).",

For instance, the UN Security Council Resolutions adopted in 1993, while expressing serious concern at the tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, referred to invasion and occupation by “local Armenian forces” and urged Armenia to exert its influence on “the Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh region” (see paragraph 59 above).

In January 2005 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, noting the occupation by Armenian forces of “considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan”, reaffirmed that independence and secession of a territory may not be achieved in the wake of “the de facto annexation of such territory to another state” ( see paragraph 64 above ). The International Crisis Group ( ICG ) report of September 2005 concluded, on the basis of statements by Armenian soldiers and officials, that “ [ t ] here is a high degree of integration between the forces of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh” ( see paragraph 65 above ).

The number of Armenian soldiers serving in the “NKR” is in dispute; the Government have stated that they number no more than 1,500 persons while the applicants rely on the figures given by the IISS and the ICG between 2002 and 2005 which indicated that 8,000 or 10,000 Armenian troops are deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above). The Court need not solve this issue as, based on the numerous reports and statements presented above, it finds it established that Armenia, through its military presence and the provision of military equipment and expertise, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date. This military support has been – and continues to be – decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the territories in issue, and the evidence, not least the Agreement, convincingly shows that the Armenian armed forces and the “NKR” are highly integrated."

The integration of the two entities is further shown by the number of politicians who have assumed the highest offices in Armenia after previously holding similar positions in the “NKR” (see paragraph 78 above).

However, its political dependence on Armenia is evident not only from the interchange of prominent politicians, but also from the fact that its residents acquire Armenian passports for travel abroad as the “NKR” is not recognised by any State or international organisation (see paragraph 83 above). In regard to the legislation and the judiciary, there is further evidence of integration. The Government have acknowledged that several laws of the “NKR” have been adopted from Armenian legislation. More importantly, the facts of Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan ( see paragraph 76 above ) show not only the presence of Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh but also the operation of Armenian law - enforcement agents and the exercise of jurisdiction by Armenian courts on that territory. The case of Mr Grigoryan ( see paragraph 77 above ) provides a similar indication."

The ICG reported that, in the 2005 “NKR” budget, only 26.7 % of expenditures were covered by locally collected revenues. An Armenian “inter- State loan” has provided the “NKR” with considerable amounts of money, throughout 2004 and 2005, totalling USD 51 million. According to the ICG, relying on official sources, the loan made up 67.3% of the “NKR” budget in 2001 and 56.9% in 2004. The loan has been in place since 1993, and in 2005, the year of the report, none of the loan had been repaid (see paragraphs 80 - 81 above)."

While the Fund is not a governmental institution and its resources come from individual donations, it is noteworthy that it was established by presidential decree. Furthermore, the Armenian President is the ex officio President of the Board of Trustees, and the Board includes several present and former Presidents and ministers of Armenia and the “NKR”, as well as other prominent officials of Armenia. While these members do not make up a majority, it is clear from the Board ’ s composition that the official representatives of Armenia – together with their “NKR” counterparts – are in a position to greatly influence the Fund ’ s activities."

Nevertheless, their complaint concerned an interference with all of their property, including land which remained in Lachin and which they still owned or had the right to use. The applicants claimed that they had continuously been denied access to their property, and that this constituted an interference that was far from being in accordance with law. Moreover, whatever the aim of the occupation of Lachin, the total exclusion of the applicants from their property and the possible destruction of it without the payment of compensation could not be seen as proportionate to the achievement of that aim.

As mentioned already in regard to the issue of the exhaustion of domestic remedies, Armenia ’ s position in the Minsk Group negotiations – that the return of displaced persons can be considered only after a final settlement of the status of the “NKR” has been agreed upon – referred to displaced persons as a group and did not concern who could obtain entry visas if they had a legitimate reason to enter the “NKR” or Armenia. Travel to the “NKR” involved no danger, as the only open entry point – the road from Yerevan to Stepanakert – is situated far away from the Line of Contact. The Government further asserted that the capture of Lachin – as well as Shusha /Shushi – was a lawful act of self-defence against war crimes committed by Azerbaijan, in particular military attacks on Stepanakert. It was necessary to create a “humanitarian corridor” to Armenia, as large numbers of people in Nagorno-Karabakh were killed or in danger of starving to death.

This state of affairs was further shown by Armenia ’ s position in the Minsk Group negotiations on displaced persons returning home. Allegedly, the level and strength of Armenian sustenance of the subordinate local administration had not decreased but rather intensified over the years.

However, whether or not these circumstances could constitute a justification for interfering with the individual rights of residents in the area, the capture of Lachin in May 1992 has no direct bearing on the issue under examination which is whether the applicants ’ inability to return there and the consequent continuous denial of access to their property could be seen as justified."

For the purposes of the first sentence of the first paragraph, the Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights (see Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 69). The Court recognises that the interference complained of in the instant case did not lack a basis. As noted above, armed clashes, generalised violence and human rights violations, specifically within the context of the PKK insurgency, compelled the authorities to take extraordinary measures to maintain security in the state of emergency region. These measures involved, among others, the restriction of access to several villages, including Boydaş, as well as evacuation of some villages on the ground of the lack of security. However, it observes that in the circumstances of the case the refusal of access to Boydaş had serious and harmful effects that have hindered the applicants ’ right to enjoyment of their possessions for almost ten years, during which time they have been living in other areas of the country in conditions of extreme poverty, with inadequate heating, sanitation and infrastructure (see paragraphs 14, 57 and 63 above). Their situation was compounded by a lack of financial assets, having received no compensation for deprivation of their possessions, and the need to seek employment and shelter in overcrowded cities and towns, where unemployment levels and housing facilities have been described as disastrous (see paragraph 63 above)."

While the Court acknowledges the Government ’ s efforts to remedy the situation of the internally displaced persons generally, for the purposes of the present case it considers them inadequate and ineffective. In this connection, it points out that the return to village and rehabilitation project referred to by the Government has not been converted into practical steps to facilitate the return of the applicants to their village. According to the visual records of 29 December 2003, Boydaş village seems to be in ruins and without any infrastructure (see paragraph 38 above). Besides the failure of the authorities to facilitate return to Boydaş, the applicants have not been provided with alternative housing or employment. Furthermore, apart from the aid given to Mr Kazım Balık and Mr Müslüm Yılmaz by the Social Aid and Solidarity Fund, which in the Court ’ s opinion is insufficient to live on, the applicants have not been supplied with any funding which would ensure an adequate standard of living or a sustainable return process. For the Court, however, the authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow the applicants to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country (see in this respect Principles 18 and 28 of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, dated 11 February 1998). Moreover, as regards the draft legislation on compensation for damage occurred as a result of the acts of terrorism or of measures taken against terrorism, the Court observes that this law is not yet in force and, accordingly, does not provide any remedy for the applicants ’ grievances under this heading."

As to the cause of the movement of the population, the Turkish authorities maintained that the movement was not caused by the violence in the region alone. They contended that economic factors also accounted for the “migration”. The report, recognising the situation of internal displacement due to the conflict in the region, confirmed the Government ’ s stand point. However, it pointed out that there was no doubt that there had been a major displacement and migration to towns affecting those caught in the crossfire of the conflict: on the one hand Turkish security forces had targeted villages suspected of supporting the PKK. On the other hand the PKK had assassinated inhabitants of the villages “collaborating” with the State authorities (i.e. belonging to the village guards system) or refusing to support the PKK.

However, the first returns had occurred in 1997, as the region had not been secure before the latter date. Despite obvious improvements, security remained the main concern conditioning mass return movements. On the one hand, the authorities felt reluctant to allow for a large influx of returnees fearing the return of PKK militants. For that reason, they scrutinize every application and did not authorize returns to certain areas. On the other hand, the displaced population was in most cases unable to return without state financial or subsistence assistance and sometimes reluctant because of fresh memory of the atrocities committed in the past. Nevertheless, the South Eastern Anatolia Project (GAP), which is a comprehensive development programme aimed at the ending of the disparities between this region and the rest of the country, financed a number of projects concerning the return and resettlement of displaced persons. Among them was the “town-villages project”, which, through the construction of centralised villages, had allowed 4,000 displaced persons to return to their region. According to the official figures, approximately 28,000 persons had returned to 200 villages up to July 2001. Even so, a number of human rights organisations were critical of the Government ’ s efforts since the application forms for those who wished to return included a question concerning the reason for leaving the village. According to these organisations, displaced persons were not allowed to return unless they gave the actions of the PKK as a reason. Furthermore, there had been allegations that return was authorised only to the villages within the village guard system."

Regarding the return and resettlement initiatives, Mr Deng primarily reported the “Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project”, which was announced by the Turkish Government in 1999. Citing the positive aspects of the project, such as the feasibility study conducted prior to the development of the project and the voluntary nature of any return and resettlement, Mr Deng expressed his concerns on a number of issues. He noted that the extent of the consultation with the displaced and the non ‑ governmental organisations working on their behalf might be insufficient. He further reported the concerns regarding the plan of a new centralised settlement pattern, as opposed to the traditional pattern of one large settlement (village) surrounded by smaller settlements (hamlets). Mr Deng noted that, although establishing security in the region through promoting centralised settlement units was a legitimate policy, the authorities should consult the displaced themselves. Two other issues that were of concern for Mr Deng were the absence of basic data which would give an accurate picture of the displacement and the failure to implement the project."

Furthermore, he had received information concerning the application forms, which included a question concerning the reason for leaving the village. According to the reports, only those persons who stated that they had been displaced as a result of “terror” were allowed to return. Mr Deng further noted that there had been allegations that return was authorised only to villages within the village guard system. He finally noted that anti ‑ personnel mines posed a threat to those who wished to return to their villages in south-east Turkey."

The Government should further consider producing a document that clearly outlines the objectives, scope and resource implications of the Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project.

In this regard, the Court points out that under the emergency rules then in force the governor of the state of emergency region was the hierarchical superior of the aforementioned two authorities who exercised powers delegated to them and implemented the decisions taken by the governor of the state-of-emergency region (see paragraph 80 above). Taking all these elements together, it considers that it is understandable if the applicants formed the belief that, having received negative answers from the local authorities who exercised emergency powers at the time, it was pointless for them to attempt to secure satisfaction through the administrative courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 908, § 70). Their feelings of upheaval and insecurity following their displacement are also of some relevance in this connection."

            [
                "105. The Court further notes that the Government referred to cases which concerned the award of compensation by the administrative courts to plaintiffs who had brought actions as a result of damage they had suffered due to the lack of security in the state of emergency region and their inability to have access to their property (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above). Undoubtedly, these decisions illustrate the real possibility of obtaining compensation before these courts in respect of damage sustained on account of the disturbances or acts of terrorism in the region. However, as the Court has constantly held in similar cases, despite the extent of village destruction or evacuation in the state of emergency region, there appears to be no example of compensation having been awarded in respect of allegations that villagers have been forcibly evicted from their homes and that property has been deliberately destroyed by members of the security forces or of prosecutions having been brought against those forces as a result of such allegations (see, mutatis mutandis, Selçuk and Asker, cited above, § 68, and Gündem v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1131, § 60). On that account, the Court points out that in the cases referred to by the Government, the administrative courts awarded compensation on the basis of the doctrine of social risk, which is not dependent on proof of fault. Thus, under Turkish law an administrative law action is a remedy based on the strict liability of the State, in particular for the illegal acts of its agents, whose identification is not, by definition, a prerequisite to bringing an action of this nature."

            [
                "106. For the Court, however, when an individual formulates an arguable claim in respect of forced eviction and destruction of property involving the responsibility of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy”, in the sense of Article 13 of the Convention, entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access by the complainant to the investigative procedure (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey, cited above, p. 2715, § 89). Otherwise, if an action based on the State ’ s strict liability were to be considered a legal action that had to be exhausted in respect of complaints under Article 8 of the Convention or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the State ’ s obligation to pursue those guilty of such serious breaches might thereby disappear."

As regards a civil action for redress for damage sustained through illegal acts or patently unlawful conduct on the part of State agents, the Court recalls that a plaintiff must, in addition to establishing a causal link between the tort and the damage he has sustained, identify the person believed to have committed the tort (see Yaşa v. Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2431, § 73). In the instant case, however, those responsible for the forced eviction of the applicants from their village are still unknown."

                "Furthermore, the Court points out that the applicants ’ complaints in the instant case essentially relate to their forced displacement and inability to return to their homes in Boydaş village, not to their inability to recover damages from the authorities."

                "109. Finally, the Court considers that a complaint to the chief public prosecutor ’ s office could in principle provide redress for the kind of violations alleged by the applicants. However, any prosecutor who receives a complaint alleging a criminal act by a member of the security forces must decline jurisdiction and transfer the file to the Administrative Council (see paragraph 86 above). On that account, the Court reiterates that it has already found in a number of cases that the investigation carried out by this body cannot be regarded as independent since it is composed of civil servants, who are hierarchically dependent on the governor, and an executive officer is linked to the security forces under investigation, (see İpek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, § 207, 17 February 2004; Yöyler v. Turkey, no. 26973/95, § 93, 24 July 2003; and Güleç v. Turkey, no.21593/93, § 80, Reports 1998 ‑ IV). It notes in this connection that the applicants filed petitions with various administrative authorities complaining about the forced evacuation of their village by the security forces (see paragraphs 15 and 29 above). These proceedings did not result in the opening of a criminal investigation or any inquiry into the applicants ’ allegations. The Court is therefore of the opinion that the applicants were not required to make a further explicit request to this effect by filing a criminal complaint with the chief public prosecutor ’ s office as this would not have led to any different result."

In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances ( see Hazar and Others v.

The Court further points out that it was not until 22 July 2003 that the applicants were told that there was no obstacle to their return to their homes in Boydaş village (see paragraph 37 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the six-month time-limit within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention started to run on 22 July 2003 at the earliest and, consequently, that the applications were brought prior to that date, i.e. 3 December 2001.",

The Government noted in this connection that under Turkish law all transactions related to immovable property and all proof concerning ownership had to be based on records of land registry. In cases where the immovable property, such as land, was not recorded at the registry, proof of ownership had to be established in accordance with the rules set out in the Civil Code. Further, where no land survey had been conducted, a decision of a judge was necessary to provide proof of ownership. Finally, the Government stressed that the statements of the mayor of Boydaş village (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above) had no evidential value as such unless they had been admitted as evidence by a national judge in a case which concerned the ownership of land or the ownership of movable property such as livestock."

They noted that in the rural area where they lived the patriarchal family system prevailed, wherein adults married, built houses on their fathers ’ land and made use of their fathers ’ property as a natural requirement of the social system.

In this regard, the Court notes that it is undisputed that the applicants all lived in Boydaş village until 1994. Although they did not have registered property, they either had their own houses constructed on the lands of their ascendants or lived in the houses owned by their fathers and cultivated the land belonging to the latter.

These disputed measures deprived the applicants of all resources from which they derived their living.

The first rule, which is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 29-30, § 37, which partly reiterates the terms of the Court ’ s reasoning in Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

It points out that the measures in question did not involve a deprivation of property within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 because the applicants have remained the legal owner or possessor of the lands in Boydaş. The measures did not amount to control of the use of property either since they did not pursue such an aim. The Court considers therefore that the situation of which the applicants complain falls to be dealt with under the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 since the impugned measures undoubtedly restricted the applicants ’ rights to use and dispose of their possessions ( Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, § 187, ECHR 2001-IV).",

They argued however that the state-of-emergency governor ’ s office had employed illegal methods to depopulate the region rather than relying on the aforementioned provision. In their opinion, the motive behind this choice was to blame the illegal organisations, such as the PKK and the TİKKO ( Workers and Peasants ’ Independence Army of Turkey ), for village evacuations, to avoid the economic burden of re-housing the population and to grant impunity to the security forces for their illegal acts."

They asserted that the “return to village and rehabilitation project” had been developed by the authorities to remedy the problems of those who had had to leave their homes on account of the terrorist incidents in the region (see paragraphs 45-48 above). The aim of this project was to ensure the voluntary return of the displaced population. Thus, its implementation had been subjected to the strict control of Parliament (see paragraphs 39-42 above). The Government had also obtained the support of several international agencies to assist in the successful implementation of this project (see paragraph 44 above). Despite budgetary restraints and serious economic difficulties, the Government had spent approximately sixty million euros within the context of this project. An important amount of this money had been used for improvement of the infrastructure in the region. The progress achieved so far had been positive and encouraging given the fact that 94,000 persons, which was approximately 25% of the total number of displaced persons, had already returned to their settlement units between June 2000 and December 2003."

Against this background, the Government concluded that the measures taken by the authorities had been proportionate to the aims pursued."

For the purposes of the first sentence of the first paragraph, the Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights (see Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 69). The Court recognises that the interference complained of in the instant case did not lack a basis. As noted above, armed clashes, generalised violence and human rights violations, specifically within the context of the PKK insurgency, compelled the authorities to take extraordinary measures to maintain security in the state of emergency region. These measures involved, among others, the restriction of access to several villages, including Boydaş, as well as evacuation of some villages on the ground of the lack of security. However, it observes that in the circumstances of the case the refusal of access to Boydaş had serious and harmful effects that have hindered the applicants ’ right to enjoyment of their possessions for almost ten years, during which time they have been living in other areas of the country in conditions of extreme poverty, with inadequate heating, sanitation and infrastructure (see paragraphs 14, 57 and 63 above). Their situation was compounded by a lack of financial assets, having received no compensation for deprivation of their possessions, and the need to seek employment and shelter in overcrowded cities and towns, where unemployment levels and housing facilities have been described as disastrous (see paragraph 63 above)."

While the Court acknowledges the Government ’ s efforts to remedy the situation of the internally displaced persons generally, for the purposes of the present case it considers them inadequate and ineffective. In this connection, it points out that the return to village and rehabilitation project referred to by the Government has not been converted into practical steps to facilitate the return of the applicants to their village. According to the visual records of 29 December 2003, Boydaş village seems to be in ruins and without any infrastructure (see paragraph 38 above). Besides the failure of the authorities to facilitate return to Boydaş, the applicants have not been provided with alternative housing or employment. Furthermore, apart from the aid given to Mr Kazım Balık and Mr Müslüm Yılmaz by the Social Aid and Solidarity Fund, which in the Court ’ s opinion is insufficient to live on, the applicants have not been supplied with any funding which would ensure an adequate standard of living or a sustainable return process. For the Court, however, the authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow the applicants to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country (see in this respect Principles 18 and 28 of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, dated 11 February 1998). Moreover, as regards the draft legislation on compensation for damage occurred as a result of the acts of terrorism or of measures taken against terrorism, the Court observes that this law is not yet in force and, accordingly, does not provide any remedy for the applicants ’ grievances under this heading."

In the present case the Court observes, as regards the examination of this complaint, that the applicants are required to notify to the AFLD a daily one-hour slot during which they will be available at a specified location for the purposes of unannounced testing.

However, it should be pointed out that this place is chosen by them and that it does not involve their home address unless they so request and subject to a limited time-frame. The Court concludes from this that the obligation in question precludes discreet comings and goings; this is more a matter of interference with privacy than a surveillance measure (see paragraphs 157 and 158 above). It takes note in that regard of the decisions of the domestic courts not to characterise the whereabouts requirement as a restriction on freedom of movement and to make a distinction between checks that come within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and those that do not (see paragraph 73 above). The measures complained of cannot therefore be equated, as the applicants contend, with electronic tagging ordered by way of adjustment of a sentence or in conjunction with a compulsory residence order as an alternative to detention.

They complained in particular of the fact that the tests could be carried out independently of sporting events and outside training periods, that is, during periods when athletes were no longer at the disposal of their employer but were on holiday, resting or on sick leave or leave following an occupational injury. They argued that Article 3 infringed their freedom of movement by requiring them to give notice of their whereabouts on an ongoing basis, including during non-professional activities, and also infringed their right to a normal family life and their individual freedom as athletes. In their view, the unconditional implementation of Article 3(I)(3)(d) of the Order, allowing tests to be carried out independently of sporting events and outside training periods, meant that between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. (the testing period laid down by Article L. 232-14 of the Sports Code, see paragraph 64 below ) the athletes in the testing pool faced the permanent prospect of physically intrusive tests. This entailed systematically giving advance notice of their schedule, in breach of the right to establish relationships with their peers and the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their private lives. Lastly, the applicants complained of a breach of the principle of equality, as the whereabouts requirement for the purposes of anti-doping tests was confined to athletes included in the testing pool."

While the arrangements thus defined place restrictions on athletes, notably by requiring them to provide accurate and up-to-date information on their whereabouts, the legislative provisions at issue are justified by the demands of efforts to combat doping. These entail, in particular, the ability to carry out unannounced tests in order effectively to detect the use of certain performance-enhancing drugs which can be detected only for a short time after being taken despite having more lasting effects.

According to Article 12, States are to encourage the implementation of doping controls in a manner consistent with the Code, including no ‑ advance - notice and out-of-competition testing. Article 19 encourages States to implement education and training programmes on anti-doping, both for athletes and for the sporting community in general, who should be provided with information on “the harm of doping to the ethical values of sport” and “the health consequences of doping”."

The report, which was submitted on 17 July 2013 and runs to around 235 pages, is divided into two sections, entitled “Doping: an ethical and health-related issue” and “Ways and means of combating doping” (including improved monitoring of competition schedules), with a concluding part under the heading “ A multi-faceted approach”. The rapporteur ’ s introduction states that “ the real dangers of doping for users are well documented”. According to the report, between 1 % and 2% of tests worldwide are positive. However, the statistics underestimate the scale of doping practices within sport, in particular because the development of detection methods always lags behind the emergence of new substances and the ingeniousness of doping protocols. More generally, the report criticises the culture of silence encountered by efforts to combat doping: the difficulty of obtaining evidence, attempts at intimidation, the lack of credibility of the sporting world ’ s attempts at self-regulation, a general denial of the problem in society, and threats to information and educational activities."

                "75. In the part entitled “The dangers of doping” the report stresses that, at first, doping was largely confined to the improper use of medication, hormones and psychoactive substances: anabolic steroids in the 1970s, and testosterone, peptide hormones (EPO and growth hormones) from the 1990s onwards. Today, improper use of medication and hormones co-exists with the development of particularly sophisticated doping protocols and even the emergence of molecules created specifically for doping purposes. The report states that “[d]oping protocols are based in particular on the simultaneous use of minute doses of several substances with different chemical structures and on a subtle balancing act between the duration of the desired effects and the duration of the window for detection”. One of the salient features of modern-day doping, according to the report, is the misuse of certain molecules that have not been placed on the market and the emergence of a specific doping-related industry. Genetic doping also constitutes a very real threat."

                "The report goes on to state that “although the undesirable effects of doping products are well known, efforts to combat doping are hindered by the lack of reliable health indicators based on accurate epidemiological data (mortality, morbidity, and so on )”. Among the proposals made by the report in that regard is the funding of epidemiological studies with a view to improving the state of knowledge concerning doping practices and the health risks involved."

It notes that this group is not covered by the provisions of the Sports Code relating to athletes ’ health and efforts to combat doping. “Thus, there continues to be very little monitoring of the non-licensed sector despite the fact that this appears to be the very area affected by what could be termed ‘ mass doping ’ ”.

At the level of the European Union in particular, it notes the differences in anti-doping legislation and encourages the EU to adopt harmonising directives on measures to combat trafficking in doping products."

If an athlete does not wish the test to be carried out at home, he or she can be escorted to the location of his or her choice (the sample-taker ’ s surgery, the athlete ’ s club, and so on). As to the timing of the unannounced tests, which is often viewed unfavourably by athletes because it disrupts the training or recovery cycle, the report stresses that these are the very stages that are “risky” in terms of the taking of doping substances. The report further specifies that the only time when unannounced tests may not be carried out is during the night, from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m."

                "This is achieved by the use of stimulants, and in particular amphetamine derivatives; by narcotics and opioids, cocaine and cannabinoids; and by glucocorticoids. Mixtures of drugs are common, the most famous being the pot belge, comprising a mix of amphetamines, cocaine and heroin! In the short term, exceeding the body ’ s limits may result in exhaustion, heat stroke or even death, especially in adverse heat conditions (the death of Tom Simpson during the 1967 Tour de France is an example ). In the medium and long term, behavioural problems, psychiatric decompensation and drug addiction may develop and, more particularly with the use of amphetamines, cardiovascular diseases may occur such as arterial hypertension or valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy in the case of cocaine use. Particular mention should be made of the regular, prolonged used of glucocorticoids, the adverse effects of which are well documented and include increased fragility of the muscles and tendons, immunosuppression, arterial hypertension and corticoadrenal insufficiency.",
                "- To enhance aerobic capacity through the use of erythropoietin (EPO) or autologous blood transfusion, most commonly in endurance sports such as marathon running and road cycling. These methods are linked to a significant risk of increased blood viscosity leading to thrombosis and embolisms, and to intolerance syndromes or transfusion-related adverse events and transmission of infectious agents.",
                "- To increase muscle mass, in sports such as sprinting and weight lifting where explosive power is key. Growth hormones, anabolic steroids and beta2-agonists are the most commonly used drugs. The consequences of abuse of these drugs, which are usually administered in supra-therapeutic doses, are many and varied and include cardiovascular problems (enlarged heart, coronary disease, arterial hypertension, rhythm disorders) and cancer (of the colon, prostate and liver).",

                "The harmful consequences of this misuse of drugs are even greater when the drugs are administered to growing children. The disastrous effects of these practices are extensively documented in the Spitzer report on the consequences of State-sponsored doping as practised on very young athletes in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The study, which covered 10,000 athletes who had taken doping agents, identified 1,000 minor disorders and 500 serious disorders including sex change, sterility and cancer.”"

According to the section of the report entitled “At-risk populations”, it is difficult to conduct epidemiological studies on the issue of doping in view of the extreme reluctance of those concerned to discuss the issue. Nevertheless, the findings made in France and certain research studies suggest that the phenomenon extends far beyond the confines of top-level sports. According to studies conducted worldwide, between 3 % and 5% of adolescents who train on a daily basis have already been confronted with the issue of doping. The report quotes an article from the newspaper La Libre Belgique which was posted online in 2010 and which states that “almost 8% of young people between the ages of 14 and 18 reportedly use growth hormones, which they order for home delivery on Belgian and foreign websites”. The report adds that while the impact of doping on adults is less well known, “an older series of articles revealed that the prevalence of doping among adults was between 5 % and 15%”."

Among the scientific aspects it notes that “certain products are the result of chemical manipulation of the structure of drugs already on the market by small laboratories operating to a greater or lesser extent illegally ... What is more worrying is the emergence of new products currently being developed by the pharmaceutical industry.” Moreover, “possibly in the near future, there is a danger of the spread of abusive techniques involving the use of ‘ normal or genetically modified cells or the transfer of nucleic acids ’ ”. The difficulties facing anti-doping organisations also include the speed of metabolisation of certain products such as EPO, and very sophisticated doping protocols. In that regard the report states that doping in top-level sports is now :",
                "“ ... in the hands of professionals with a good knowledge of pharmacology, the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and the physiology of the practice : the elimination time and the period during which the products or their metabolites can be detected in urine, the duration of the effects and the mixtures of drugs which reduce the dose administered and result in a shorter window of detection. They also have access to laboratories capable of testing before a competition for the residual presence or absence of illegal products in the blood and urine. It is clear that the current doping protocols could not be established without the active participation of scientists, doctors and pharmacists.”",

They cite the fact that administering the biological passport programme costs the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) around four to five million euros annually. Opponents of this approach advocate legalising doping and placing it under medical supervision. This position appears to ignore the reality. Sporting careers are continuous: elite athletes are not ‘ born ’, they evolve gradually through talent and hard work and after overcoming numerous selection hurdles. This lengthy process begins at a young age and may result in addictive behaviours. Consequently, if doping were to be made legal and appeared essential in order to succeed in sport, children would follow the example of their role models, magnified by the media, and would engage in doping very early on, with potentially harmful consequences for their health.",
                "Lastly, sports ethics are based on equality of opportunity. If doping were authorised, champions ’ victories and performances would be largely the result of the skill of the teams of scientists; the latter ’ s reputation would grow accordingly, placing athletes at risk of turning into human guinea pigs.”"

Likewise, the fact that they were in the IRB ’ s testing pool did not confer victim status on them, as that federation had its registered office in Ireland and therefore did not come within the jurisdiction of the French State.

In these circumstances it considers that only those applicants who were included in the testing pool on the date on which the application was lodged, that is, on 23 July 2011, can claim victim status under Article 34 of the Convention. This was not the case with the eight applicants in the IRB pool. Furthermore, and having regard to the evidence before it, it considers that only the applicants referred to in paragraphs 13 (c) and (d) and 16 (b) above may claim victim status under Article 34. Lastly, as regards the victim status of the five applicants referred to in paragraph 14 above, the Court notes that the persons in question were included in the testing pool on the date on which the application was lodged, and that it is not disputed that they were subject to the whereabouts requirement and to tests which resulted in warnings being issued. It therefore considers that their removal from the testing pool in 2014 is not apt to deprive them of their victim status, as inclusion in the pool is by definition limited in duration.

In these circumstances, and in view of the rejection of the application by the Conseil d ’ État on 24 February 2011, the Court considers that they were not required to lodge a further application with that court that was manifestly bound to fail.

Accordingly, the Court will not examine these complaints despite the observations made by the parties on these two issues. While the same consideration applies to the complaint concerning the right to respect for “private life”, this complaint nevertheless concerns a specific aspect of the initial complaint raised within the time-limit under the right to respect for “family life” and may thus be examined by the Court ( see, for example, Sâmbata Bihor Greek Catholic Parish v.

The applicants, observing that the law aligned the timetable for the anti-doping whereabouts system with the timetable for home searches, complained of being permanently monitored. They added that the one-hour time slot which they had to declare for the purposes of individualised tests did not prevent tests being carried out at any time, as provided for by Article L. 232-14 of the Sports Code and Article 3 of decision no. 54 (see paragraphs 64 and 69 above)."

Their lifestyle was also adversely affected as they were limited in their choice of where to conduct their private lives: for instance, they could not go hiking or camping or be more than twenty-four hours away from a location where a test could be carried out."

Secondly, in order to be able to declare a location for the purposes of the sixty-minute time slot (Article 3 of decision no. 54, see paragraph 69 above) that was suitable for tests and satisfied the criteria of respect for their privacy, especially at weekends and on public and other holidays, they were obliged, de facto if not de jure, to declare a time slot when they would be at home.

The purpose of their application was to challenge the constraints laid down by law and not those determined by the AFLD itself, which were liable to be changed simply by means of a decision. They cited as an example the daily time slot, which was laid down solely by a decision of the AFLD. Given the non-binding nature of the UNESCO Convention the Agency could, by means of a similar decision, require athletes to be available for a three-hour period."

Furthermore, the health of professional athletes was already taken care of by means of medical supervision of a high standard, unannounced tests at training and competition venues, and the biological monitoring organised by the federations. By way of comparison, no coercive measures were taken with regard to the major public-health issues of smoking and alcohol abuse. The two applicants also argued that it was inconsistent to ban doping while promoting sports such as boxing and American football which caused harm to athletes. By definition, top-level sports carried risks and could adversely affect athletes ’ health in the long term. Lastly, the products consumed were not damaging to athletes ’ health in so far as they could be prescribed for anyone.",

Firstly, referring to the remarks made by the Senate Committee concerning the lack of an epidemiological study on doping agents and the health risks of doping (see paragraph 76 above), they argued that it had never been demonstrated that prohibited substances could be detected for only a very short period and that samples therefore had to be taken every day, including at weekends."

                "122. Secondly, the statistics on out-of-competition testing showed that the number of athletes testing positive for doping agents was extremely small. In this regard the applicants cited a year-long study conducted in nine European countries by Uni Global Union (a world federation of sports unions) which showed that, of 13,738 tests carried out during competitions, 222 had been positive, while the 17,166 out-of-competition tests carried out had revealed only 28 violations of the anti-doping rules."

Thirdly, the interference in question was in any event disproportionate to the aim of protecting health since, as paid professional athletes, they already underwent checks in the context of occupational health schemes. They worked under the responsibility and supervision of an employer, and unannounced checks could be carried out at their places of work for almost eleven months of the year. Furthermore, they were subject to legislation which derogated from the ordinary law. In the applicants ’ submission, no other professional category was subject to such intrusive requirements entailing heavy disciplinary penalties. They cited the examples of members of the armed forces, doctors, airline pilots, senior industrialists and politicians."

Firstly, they emphasised the spectacular increase in the industrial manufacture of doping agents and the time lag in monitoring the technology used by the pharmaceutical industry. Inspectors were looking for substances which athletes no longer used while the athletes were taking substances which the inspectors were not yet looking for. They also stressed the ambiguous role of the national and international sports federations in tackling doping and the limited powers of those federations, as private entities, to take action."

The two applicants further submitted that the supposed international consensus in favour of unannounced testing, on which WADA and the Government based their approach, was a false consensus.

The two applicants stressed that the system of declaring one ’ s whereabouts for one hour each day as described by WADA in its observations (see paragraph 150 below) did not fully correspond to the system in place or to the French system. A testing system that was less detrimental to athletes ’ rights could be implemented. This would entail taking into account the seriousness of the suspected infringement, a whereabouts requirement that applied only after a first violation of the WADC, the possibility of a “holiday period” from the whereabouts requirement after the season had passed its peak, freedom to choose between the requirement to provide details of one ’ s place of residence and a daily sixty-minute period of availability, and strengthening States ’ efforts to combat the illegal production of doping agents and trafficking."

In France, the athletes in question were required to submit a provisional schedule for each quarter declaring, for each day, a location and a sixty-minute time slot of their own choosing for the purposes of individualised testing; the time slot had to be between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m."

In the Government ’ s submission, these legislative and regulatory instruments gave precise details of the requirements in question. According to the case-law of the Constitutional Council, an independent administrative authority could be vested with regulatory powers, and the model disciplinary regulations (referred to in Article 13 in fine of decision no. 54, see paragraph 69 above) authorised the AFLD to take action with regard to whereabouts (see paragraph 68 above). In this sphere the AFLD had to comply with the requirements inherent in the hierarchy of norms, including international treaties and undertakings such as the Council of Europe Convention and the UNESCO Convention."

These were near-universal values, a fact reflected in the preamble to the UNESCO Convention (see paragraph 53 above), and were in accordance with the aims referred to in Article 8 § 2 in the context of “protection of health or morals”. With regard to the protection of health the Government argued that the fact that the whereabouts requirement was confined to professional athletes did not mean that the authorities were indifferent to the situation of amateur sportsmen and women. They further stressed that it was not the use of the drugs as such that was damaging to health, but their misuse for non ‑ therapeutic purposes. The Government rejected the argument that doping should be authorised subject to “proper medical supervision”. This would encourage a return to practices which the sporting community and States had resolved to put behind them. Sporting competition should not become a confrontation between laboratories with athletes caught in the middle. As to morals, the Government dismissed the idea that efforts to combat doping were confined to protecting the economic interests of “spectator sports” without concern for ethics. The fact that sport was not immune to certain excesses should not lead to their being tolerated, at the risk of increasing the harmful effects, but rather to their being tackled, precisely for ethical reasons."

Some prohibited substances such as growth hormones and EPO had a very short life and became impossible to detect after a few days or even a few hours, and there were numerous means of avoiding detection. There was broad international consensus on the necessity of unannounced tests and how they should be conducted, as evidenced by the undertakings given by States in ratifying the UNESCO Convention and the fact that 660 bodies representing all the actors involved in anti-doping (with the exception of the professional sports leagues in the United States), as well as the AFLD, abided by the WADC (see paragraph 68 above). The Government concluded from this that States had a wide discretion with regard to the interference complained of."

                "(b) The decision to include an athlete in the testing pool was taken after an adversarial stage. It was taken by the AFLD Board, had to be accompanied by reasons and was amenable to review by the administrative courts.",
                "(c) The duration of inclusion in the pool was limited since inclusion was on an annual basis. Re-registering an athlete in the pool entailed reviewing his or her situation.",
                "(d) The chosen location could be changed up to 5 p.m. the previous day, or in exceptional circumstances even up to the start of the sixty-minute time slot declared by the person concerned.",
                "(e) Tests were carried out at athletes ’ homes only with their consent, and athletes were required only to provide information about the location and not about their private and family life.",
                "(f) The sanction imposed related only to the athlete ’ s absence from the declared location during the time slot. The sanctions were administrative rather than criminal and were proportionate, being imposed only following three failures to comply over an eighteen-month period; the first missed test was not regarded as a failure to comply.",
                "(g) The low rate of positive tests was widely interpreted as a sign of the effectiveness and deterrent impact of the means deployed, including the tests carried out on the basis of the whereabouts information."

In reply to the two applicants ’ observations concerning athletes ’ lack of consent to the system in place, the Government observed that the rules were applied not on the basis of athletes ’ support for them but on the basis of the law and the regulations.

Replying to the applicants ’ argument that professional athletes were not the “right people” to be testing, the Government stated that it was not their professional status that made them subject to the legislation but rather their status as athletes. The controls were not designed to test their aptitude for a job but pursued a public-health objective. That was why the testing was not carried out by the employer but by an independent public authority."

They were perfectly free to organise their private and family lives provided that they set aside a time slot of one hour, which could be at a place and time of their choosing. Declaring that location certainly did not mean that they were required to inform the AFLD of all the places they frequented. Furthermore, the application of the system during public and other holidays was justified in order to ensure its effectiveness."

In practice, the unannounced tests took place at her home or at her temporary lodgings when she was travelling, as this was the only fixed point where she could definitely be located.

Furthermore, prior to 2012 (see paragraph 28 above), the authority responsible for registering athletes in the testing pool had not been clearly designated, giving rise to heavy-handed and arbitrary decisions. The law did not define the nature and content of the unannounced tests.

It did not protect athletes ’ health as it subjected them to permanent stress that was very damaging to their physical and mental health. Giving samples repeatedly – the applicant stated that she had been required to give one every three or four days – damaged the veins and strength in the arms, and in conjunction with training resulted in intense fatigue which posed a danger to the athletes concerned. Professional athletes took greater care of their health than people who were sedentary; therefore, there was no real reason to protect athletes ’ health any more than the health of pregnant women who smoked, drank or took drugs, or students who took drugs in order to succeed. Since the introduction of the testing pool, virtually no cases of doping had come to light as a result of unannounced testing. The creation of a testing pool was incompatible with the principles of fairness and equity because it stigmatised the athletes concerned, who were “presumed guilty”, vis-à-vis their colleagues who had freedom of movement and action. Lastly, the applicant ’ s inclusion in such a pool discriminated against her on the basis of her age and gender, and was the very opposite of fair given that she had represented France with dignity in numerous competitions."

As to the necessity of the measure, the applicant stressed, firstly, that only genuinely random tests conducted outside the sports season and for all sports were likely to be effective. Secondly, there was no reason for always registering the same athletes in the testing pool, which was already small; the applicant maintained that her situation had not been reviewed after she had been cleared of misconduct. Her re-registration in the testing pool after she had been cleared, which had attracted media coverage, had amounted to a breach of her right to be presumed innocent. Thirdly, the applicant complained of voyeurism on the part of the AFLD, which knew at all times where athletes were and what they were doing. This meant that there was no provision for unforeseen events (a meal that lasted longer than expected, an unexpected meeting, a short bout of tiredness, family problems, and so on). The applicant complained in particular of the tests carried out in hotels, which were intrusive and humiliating because they were conducted in full public view. Family members were not spared either as they were confronted with the reality of the tests, like habitual offenders in their own home. Fourthly, last-minute changes to the time slot could not be made by telephone, and the athlete ’ s relatives could not change it by email at the last minute. Fifthly, the athletes ’ consent was not sought before a tester visited them at home, at a hotel or with their family."

She complained that the operation of the AFLD lacked transparency: the public should be informed of the names of the athletes in the pool, the discipline concerned, the reasons for inclusion, the number of failures to comply, the samples taken, the length of time for which they were kept and their destruction. This was the only means of verifying compliance with the rules of equality and fairness for each sport and each category of athletes.

Anti-doping measures were taken across the globe by governments and the sports world alike, both of which had adopted international instruments in this sphere (the Council of Europe Convention, the WADC and the UNESCO Convention). A consensus existed on the absolute necessity of out-of-competition testing, which was not possible without the whereabouts system.

Moreover, some athletes consumed minute doses of certain substances (EPO, steroids) which could not be detected during competitions. Hence, the surprise effect of out ‑ of ‑ competition testing was necessary in order to take account of manipulations such as hyperhydration, dilution of the blood or urine substitution, which masked prohibited substances or made it impossible, within a very short space of time, to detect them."

Since then, the window during which tests could be carried out had been reduced to the period between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., and between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. in France, and athletes had to make themselves available only for one hour; (3) athletes could choose the location where they wished to be tested during their chosen one-hour time slot and which did not have to be their home; (4) the system was sufficiently flexible to allow athletes to declare a change of whereabouts easily; and (5) as far as sanctions were concerned, there had to be at least three failures to comply before disciplinary proceedings could be instituted.

Belgium, 13 June 1979, § 31, Series A no. 31). The concept of “private life” is initially understood as the right to privacy, that is, the right to live, as far as one wishes, protected from publicity (see X. v. Iceland, no. 6825/74, Commission decision of 18 May 1976, DR 5) or the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 95, ECHR 2003-IX)."

It encompasses the right for each individual to approach others in order to establish and develop relationships with them and with the outside world, that is, the right to a “private social life”, and may include professional activities or activities taking place in a public context (ibid., §§ 70 and 71). According to the Court, “[t]here is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of ‘ private life ’ ” (see Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I, and Uzun v.

                "154. The Court further reiterates that, just like “private life”, the concept of “home” in Article 8 of the Convention is an autonomous concept which does not depend on classification under domestic law but is defined by reference to the factual circumstances, namely the existence of sufficient and continuous links with a specific place (see Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, § 36, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area ( see Giacomelli v. Italy, no. 59909/00, § 76, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII). It is protected, among other things, from concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person ’ s home (ibid.). The notion of “home” can be interpreted widely and may apply to a holiday home (see Demades v. Turkey, no. 16219/90, §§ 31 to 34, 31 July 2003, and Fägerskiöld v. Sweden, no. 37664/04, 26 February 2008). The Court has not ruled out that an artist ’ s dressing room or a hotel room may be considered as a “home” ( see Hartung v. France (dec.), no. 10231/07, 3 November 2009, and O ’ Rourke v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 39022/97, 26 June 2001). Lastly, the concept of home is not confined to places of residence where private life is conducted. It encompasses professional premises, because to interpret the words “private life” and “home” as including certain professional or business activities or premises is consonant with the essential object and purpose of Article 8, namely to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 31, Series A no. 251 ‑ B ).",

The tests in question may be carried out independently of sports events and training periods. They may therefore be conducted at an athlete ’ s home if the athlete concerned has chosen it as the location for the one-hour time slot during which he or she is liable for testing by the AFLD."

The Court thus notes that the athletes in the testing pool are required to provide a public authority with accurate, detailed and up-to-date information on their places of residence and their daily movements, seven days a week. They are further subject, for one hour each day, to a stringent requirement regarding their whereabouts and availability. Non-compliance with these obligations is regarded as a failure to comply with the requirement to submit whereabouts information (Article 9 of decision no. 54, see paragraph 69 above). At the relevant time, three failures to comply over a period of eighteen consecutive months resulted in a sanction (Article 13 of decision no. 54, see paragraph 69 above). In order to determine whether such obligations amount to interference with the right to respect for private life, the Court must examine the repercussions of these measures on the applicants ’ daily lives, and in particular the constraints and restrictions to which they may give rise."

In that connection the Court notes the varied and exhaustive nature of the information which the applicants are required to provide concerning their private lives, and which covers all the public and private spaces they frequent. The information in fact relates to the places in which all their activities are carried out, both professional (for instance, training venues) and those unrelated to sport. It also encompasses their private address, whether it be their home or any temporary lodgings they may be staying in for professional or private reasons. Furthermore, as these details must be provided for each coming quarter, the persons concerned are obliged to plan their private lives by organising their schedule a long time in advance. In addition, these plans are binding because any change during the quarter has to be notified. Lastly, the requirements in question limit athletes ’ life choices, as they are strictly obliged to be present and available for one hour each day at a precise location suitable for testing purposes. Even though it is foreseeable for top-level athletes, this requirement of transparency and availability suffices for the Court to consider that the obligations complained of by the applicants adversely affect the quality of their private lives and entail consequences for their family life and lifestyle. In particular, they reduce the immediate personal autonomy of the persons concerned."

Secondly, it notes in any event that Article L. 232-13-1-3 of the Sports Code makes provision for the tests to be carried out at athletes ’ homes. The Court observes that the applicants sometimes have no choice but to stay at home during this daily time slot, a fact which the Government did not dispute. They therefore face a dilemma: either they comply with the impugned requirement and thus give up the peaceful enjoyment of their home, or they refuse to comply and thus lay themselves open to sanctions even if they have not used prohibited substances."

Secondly, it refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law. The phrase thus implies, inter alia, that domestic law must be sufficiently foreseeable in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which the authorities are entitled to resort to measures affecting their rights under the Convention. According to the settled case-law, the concept of “law” must be understood in its “substantive” sense, not its “formal” one. It therefore includes everything that goes to make up the written law, including enactments of lower rank than statutes, and the relevant case-law authority (see Fernández Martínez v.

That instrument, which was published in the Official Gazette, is therefore accessible. It provides that athletes must be informed of their inclusion in the testing pool, a decision which is always preceded by an adversarial stage and is amenable to judicial review by the Conseil d ’ État (see paragraph 60 above). It also gives details concerning the content of the whereabouts information, the means by which the information may be submitted and changed, failures to comply with the whereabouts requirement and the sanctions liable to be imposed.

As regards the first aim referred to, namely the protection of “health”, the Court observes, like the Government, that this aim is enshrined in the relevant international instruments and that all the evidence in the file is consistent with that aim. The Council of Europe Convention (see paragraph 40 above), the WADC (see paragraph 45 above), the UNESCO Convention (see paragraph 53 above) and the Sports Code (see paragraph 57 above) are unanimous in presenting efforts to combat doping as a health concern which the sporting world is seeking to address (see paragraphs 171 to 177 below ).

The Court considers that what the Government describe as “morals”, in the context of efforts to ensure equal and meaningful competition in sports, is also linked to the legitimate aim of “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. The use of doping agents in order to gain an advantage over other athletes unfairly eliminates competitors of the same level who do not have recourse to them, is a dangerous incitement to amateur athletes, and in particular young people, to follow suit in order to enhance their performance, and deprives spectators of the fair competition which they are entitled to expect.",

Both texts also warn of the ongoing development of highly sophisticated doping protocols, made possible by the use of substances administered in very small doses and with complex chemical structures. These doping methods can be detected only for a very short period but have a lasting effect on performance. Furthermore, the reports point out that new agents are being developed by laboratories specifically devoted to such research, often operating illegally, and that the sophisticated doping protocols are established with “the active participation of scientists, doctors and pharmacists”. This makes it very difficult to adapt detection methods to keep pace with the emergence of these new substances.

The Court does not rule out the possibility, as asserted by the applicants, that athletes ’ health may be harmed by factors unconnected to the taking of doping agents, in view of the intensity and high level of competitions. It notes in that connection the constant pressure to which some of them are subjected and observes that the relevant reports advocate regulating the number of competition fixtures (see paragraphs 74 and 88 above).

The above ‑ mentioned reports show that doping affects amateur sports to a worrying extent, in particular among young athletes. The document adopted by the Medical Academy highlights the significant incidence of doping among adolescents and points to the numerous disorders which may affect this category of individuals, who are still growing (see paragraphs 83 and 84 above). The Senate report warns of a phenomenon which it describes as mass doping (see paragraph 77 above). The Court also attaches weight to the impact which doping among professional athletes has on the amateur sporting world. It is widely recognised that young people identify with elite athletes, who act as role models for them. The UNESCO Convention clearly demonstrates the concerns surrounding the impact of doping on the sporting community in general, and in particular on the young. For that reason it stresses the importance of educational programmes on the subject (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above). According to the Medical Academy, prevention requires the involvement of top-level athletes (see paragraphs 85 to 87 above).

France, which has ratified the UNESCO Convention, made a very clear choice to bring its domestic law into conformity with the principles of the WADC as regards athletes ’ whereabouts. The enactment of the Order of 14 April 2010 and the AFLD ’ s commitment to the principles of the WADC (see paragraph 68 above) place it among the European countries that have transposed the WADC rules on whereabouts almost in their entirety as they resulted from the revision of that instrument in 2009. Some of the applicants submitted that this was irrelevant since States were not bound by WADA rules and no international consensus existed in favour of unannounced testing (see paragraph 126 above). In that connection the Court observes that the States Parties to the UNESCO Convention undertook to adopt appropriate measures consistent with the principles of the WADC. In the instant case the respondent State ’ s approach to anti-doping is in line with the consensus that emerges from the specialised international instruments. Hence, the Court stresses that the fact that domestic law coincided at the relevant time with the international rules concerning athletes ’ whereabouts and unannounced testing is a reflection of States ’ margin of appreciation with regard to the implementation of those international rules."

Hence, it considers that the common international-law standards which form the background to the legal question before it are a factor which it must take into account in deciding whether the interference at issue was necessary in a democratic society.",

                "185. The Court noted above the particular difficulties encountered by the applicants in order to comply with the whereabouts requirements. It is mindful, firstly, that for some of them whose registration in the testing pool has been renewed several times, the constraints imposed by the whereabouts system may attain a level of day-to-day interference which, over a lengthy period, gives cause for concern. However, it observes that the Order of 14 April 2010 specifically sets a one-year term of validity for registration in the testing pool. This new provision, although it does not exclude the possibility of renewal following an interview with the athlete (see paragraph 60 above), represents an improvement of the procedural safeguards afforded to the athletes concerned."

                "186. Secondly, in some circumstances athletes may, for practical reasons, have to declare their whereabouts at their home address or in a holiday home during weekends and holidays, with the possibility of having to submit to tests there. Such a situation interferes with the peaceful enjoyment of their home and adversely affects their private and family life. Nevertheless, the Court observes that the use of these locations is “at [their] request and within a fixed time slot” (see paragraph 73 above) and is required in order to ensure the effectiveness of doping controls. Hence, these tests are carried out in a context that is very different from that of checks conducted under the supervision of the courts for the purpose of investigating offences and potentially giving rise to seizures (see paragraph 66 above ). These last, by definition, go to the core of the right to respect for the home and the tests in question cannot be equated with them."

            [
                "187. In any event the Court considers that the rules on whereabouts adopted by the French authorities provide a legal framework for efforts to combat doping which should not be underestimated in terms of safeguarding the rights of the athletes concerned. The Court refers to its finding that the “law” in France satisfies the requirement of “quality of the law”, and considers that the clarity with which the obligations imposed on the applicants are laid down affords procedural safeguards against the risks of abuse. The Order of 14 April 2010, as codified in the Sports Code, as well as the decisions of the AFLD, thus establish a framework capable of ensuring that athletes can challenge their inclusion in the testing pool, including by means of an appeal to the courts (see paragraph 60 above). The Order also enables them to anticipate and adopt the necessary conduct as regards the places and times arranged for the testing (see paragraphs 63 and 64 above), as only a failure to be available at the place and time designated by them constitutes a missed test (see paragraph 69 above). Lastly, it provides them with the possibility of challenging any sanctions imposed before the administrative courts (see paragraph 65 above)."

                "188. In contesting the necessity of the impugned interference the applicants argued that the tests to which they were subjected were ineffective. However, although the figures produced in the proceedings confirm that the number of positive tests is low, the Court agrees with the Government that this is due at least in part to the deterrent effect of anti ‑ doping measures. The Court is mindful of the fact that the tests made possible by the whereabouts requirements for athletes are just one aspect of action to tackle doping, which has numerous other aspects. However, in its view, the applicants cannot rely on the complexity of the issue in order to claim exemption from the whereabouts requirements. As they are directly concerned by a scourge that is particularly prevalent in the world of top ‑ level sports in which they compete, they must accept their fair share of the constraints inherent in the measures needed to combat that scourge. Likewise, the allegedly endemic nature of doping in sports cannot call into question the legitimacy of efforts to tackle it; on the contrary, it justifies the desire of the authorities to succeed in so doing."

The Court is not persuaded, either, by the applicants ’ argument that the authorities ’ supposed lack of action with regard to other health dangers such as tobacco, or the fact that other professions concerned by health issues are subject to fewer checks, are a source of injustice to them. Even assuming the applicant ’ s claim to be well-founded, it does not justify a failure by the authorities to take action against doping, which would be tantamount to saying that two wrongs cancel each other out."

Lastly, the applicants have not demonstrated that testing confined to training grounds and respecting private time would be sufficient to achieve the national authorities ’ objectives, in view of the development of increasingly sophisticated doping methods and the very short time-frame within which prohibited substances can be detected. Given the risks established by the evidence in the file and the difficulty of reducing them effectively, the Court agrees with the Government that the whereabouts requirements imposed in accordance with the above-mentioned norms of international law should be regarded as justified."

Reducing or removing the requirements of which the applicants complain would be liable to increase the dangers of doping to their health and that of the entire sporting community, and would run counter to the European and international consensus on the need for unannounced testing. The Court therefore finds that the respondent State struck a fair balance between the different interests at stake and that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

The measure in no sense amounted to police surveillance of the persons concerned of the kind described in the case of Labita, cited above, and in Denizci and Others v. Cyprus ( nos. 25316 ‑ 25321/94 and 27207/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ V ). Likewise, the athletes concerned did not have to apply for permission to travel abroad.

They complained that the disclosure of their address or their destination meant that they had to account constantly for their movements. Furthermore, the requirement to indicate a time slot obliged them to be in a specific place (one that was suitable for conducting urine and blood tests) between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. This meant, for practical if not legal purposes, that they had to be at home."

It further observes, as did the Government, that special supervision measures accompanied by an order for compulsory residence amount in principle to restrictions on freedom of movement falling to be examined under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 ( see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, §§ 83 et seq., 23 February 2017).

In the present case the Court observes, as regards the examination of this complaint, that the applicants are required to notify to the AFLD a daily one-hour slot during which they will be available at a specified location for the purposes of unannounced testing. This means that they are obliged to remain in a specific place for one hour each day. However, it should be pointed out that this place is chosen by them and that it does not involve their home address unless they so request and subject to a limited time-frame. The Court concludes from this that the obligation in question precludes discreet comings and goings; this is more a matter of interference with privacy than a surveillance measure (see paragraphs 157 and 158 above). It takes note in that regard of the decisions of the domestic courts not to characterise the whereabouts requirement as a restriction on freedom of movement and to make a distinction between checks that come within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and those that do not (see paragraph 73 above). The measures complained of cannot therefore be equated, as the applicants contend, with electronic tagging ordered by way of adjustment of a sentence or in conjunction with a compulsory residence order as an alternative to detention.

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (see Nada v.

However, a domestic appeal procedure cannot be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention unless it affords the possibility of dealing with the substance of an “arguable complaint” for Convention purposes and granting appropriate relief. In this way, by giving direct expression to the States ’ obligation to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal system, Article 13 establishes an additional guarantee for individuals in order to ensure that they effectively enjoy those rights (see Riener v.

Despite the previous orders, the applicant had continued his undesirable conduct and on this ground the imposition of a new prohibition order had been sought. The Burgomaster’s representative further stated that the address where the applicant had stated that he resided and where he collected his mail and social security benefits was in fact the address of the Streetcornerwork Foundation. It was not possible to reside at that address.

It further found that the order was in conformity with Section 172 (3) of the Municipality Act, that therefore it was not necessary to examine the question whether or not the conditions set out in Section 175 of the Municipality Act had been fulfilled, and that the Burgomaster had not exceeded his competence under the Municipality Act.

However, as it was not established that this had harmed the applicant’s interests, it did not find that this flaw should result in the quashing of the order. It did, however, find that the order should be quashed on other grounds."

The Regional Court held that, unlike the situation in which an eight ‑ hour prohibition order has been imposed, Section 172 (3) of the Municipality Act offered no basis for the imposition of a prohibition order for a duration of fourteen days. It held on this point that the competence established by this provision aimed to create a possibility for direct reaction to an expected disturbance of public order and might serve to prohibit someone’s presence for a limited period of time in the area where the disturbance of public order was expected. It held that the eight-hour prohibition order was such as to meet this need, but not the fourteen days prohibition order, the latter measure being disproportionate in relation to the expected disruption of public order and thus going beyond what could be considered necessary for maintaining public order."

The prohibition order implied that the applicant’s freedom of movement was limited for fourteen days in a manner which prevented him from collecting his mail and from receiving his social security benefits. It rejected the argument advanced by the Burgomaster’s representative that the police would not undertake any formal action against the applicant for acting contrary to Article 184 of the Criminal Code ( Wetboek van Strafrecht ), i.e. the offence of failure to comply with an official order ( ambtelijk bevel ), when collecting his social security benefits at the address of the Streetcornerwork Foundation, considering that the applicant’s freedom of movement could not be made dependent on the willingness of the police officer on duty to tolerate intrinsically punishable conduct."

This instruction designates the Ganzenhoef area as an “emergency area” and indicates the behaviour which the appellant considers to be constitutive of serious breaches of public order, including the overt possession or use on or near the public highway of addictive substances within the meaning of Section 2 of the Opium Act.",

The Administrative Jurisdiction Division does not share this opinion. Its reasons are the following.",
                "It is laid down in Section 175, first paragraph, of the Municipality Act that in case of a riotous movement, of other serious disorders or of calamities, as well as in case of a well-founded fear of the development thereof, the Burgomaster is empowered to issue all orders which he deems necessary for the maintenance of public order or the limitation of general danger. In doing so he may deviate from rules other than those of the Constitution.",

As did Section 219, Section 175 grants the Burgomaster emergency powers which should only be used in exceptional situations. Thus provision has been made by law for circumstances in which ordinary means are insufficient to restore and maintain public order. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division notes in this connection that the wording of Section 175 does not lead to the conclusion that that provision, as compared with Section 219, is intended to introduce any changes as regards the circumstances in which emergency powers may be used. Its drafting history does not justify holding otherwise.",
                "In the opinion of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, ordinary means may be considered insufficient in the present case and there was, at the time of the decision on the objection, an exceptional situation of the kind referred to above. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division finds in this regard that the facts relating to the situation in the Ganzenhoef area, based on which the appellant decided to issue the fourteen-day prohibition order, are established. In light of the decision of 28 October 1993 the situation there was characterised by the presence of a large number of drug addicts and the attendant nuisance, inconvenience, insecurity and threats to other citizens. This factual situation is so serious that the personnel and means available to the appellant were insufficient to counter the disruptions of public order thereby caused.",

At that time there was no relevant provision in any municipality bye-law, nor were any other adequate administrative-law means available. Given that the decision dismissing the objection was given before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division delivered its decision of 14 May 1996 ..., the absence of such a provision cannot be held against the appellant. Apart from that, by a decision of 26 June 1996, Section 2.6 A has been added to the General Municipal Bye-law of Amsterdam, which contains a regulation governing prohibition orders in relation to hard drugs. Against this background, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division is of the opinion that it cannot be maintained that the appellant was not entitled to use the powers granted him by Section 175 of the Municipality Act.",

As to the argument put forward on the applicant’s behalf to the effect that the Burgomaster’s instructions ought to have been published, the Government observed that these were internal instructions to the police and not aimed at informing the public.

After the fourth such breach of public order, a warning was to be issued to the effect that any further breach could result in the issuance of a fourteen-day prohibition order by or on behalf of the Burgomaster.

The applicant argued that the two types of prohibition order available to the Burgomaster, namely the eight-hour prohibition order and the fourteen-day prohibition order, were applied uniformly without any regard for the personal circumstances of the individual concerned. Moreover, whatever might have been the situation when the Burgomaster first gave the impugned instructions to the police, after more than ten or eleven years it could no longer be said that so serious a restriction without an adequate legal basis corresponded to a “pressing social need”. In fact, the length of time that had passed since the Burgomaster had first designated a part of Amsterdam as an “emergency area”, the number of additional areas so designated since then and the continued existence of an “emergency” proved that such designations were ineffective; the impugned measures could therefore not be considered “necessary in a democratic society”. The behaviour which might give rise to prohibition orders was in any case designated as criminal by the law and it was thus more appropriate to arrest offenders than to impose prohibition orders on them. Finally, it was not stated in writing, either in the prohibition order itself or elsewhere, that the applicant could visit the Streetcornerwork Foundation (located within the prohibited area) to collect his social-security benefits. This meant that he risked arrest for disobeying the prohibition order every time he went there."

Before applying such a measure, which was limited in time, to the applicant the Burgomaster had ascertained that he would not suffer undue hardship as a result – that is, that the applicant did not live or work in the area in question – and had ensured that the applicant would be able to collect his social ‑ security benefits and his mail from the Streetcornerwork Foundation.

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention.

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

                "51. The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention. Having regard to the established common European and international standard, the Court considers that the Russian Government were under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining the restriction in question."

The Court reiterates that, as in the Bartik case, the confidential information which the applicant possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require his presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. The Government's claim that the applicant would be abducted by foreign intelligence services or terrorist organisations while abroad appears to be mere conjecture not supported by any actual assessment of the security risks in the applicant's individual case because of the blanket nature of the prohibition on private international travel in respect of all those who, like the applicant, had had access to State secrets in the past."

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 28, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 50 and 51, Reports 1998 ‑ I; Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16 December 1992, §§ 39 and 46, Series A no. 252; and Pasko v. Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 2 2 October 2009 ), such a restriction must in all cases be commensurate with its protective function.

The applicant has been affected by the restriction on his right to travel abroad for a considerable period of time, that is, for more than five years following the termination of his employment.

It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."

With regard to the lawfulness of the measure, the Court reiterates its settled case-law according to which the expression “in accordance with law” not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects (see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V). In order for the law to meet the criterion of foreseeability, it must set forth with sufficient precision the conditions in which a measure may be applied, to enable the persons concerned – if need be, with appropriate advice – to regulate their conduct."

The interference thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. In this regard, the Court also notes that the Constitutional Court, in its judgment no. 464 of 1997, stated that the essence of the relevant section of Law no. 1185 of 1967 is to “to ensure that the parent fulfils his or her obligations towards his or her children”."

Furthermore, even were it justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual ’ s rights if it is automatically extended over a long period (see Luordo, cited above, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35)."

They may not extend for long periods measures restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement without regular re-examination of their justification (see Riener, cited above, § 124, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35). Such review should normally be carried out, at least in the final instance, by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of the independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures (see Sissanis v. Romania, no. 23468/02, § 70, 25 January 2007). The scope of the judicial review should enable the court to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see, mutatis mutandis, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.

The domestic courts (see paragraphs 11-12 above) emphasised that the applicant had not made the required maintenance payments in respect of his children, and that there was a risk that he would make no further payments if he travelled abroad."

A suspended sentence does not mean that the convicted offender has been exempted from punishment: he or she is on probation during the specified period of time and may be subject to additional restrictions during that period (Articles 73 and 86(3) of the Criminal Code). The Constitutional Court inferred therefrom that the restriction on the right to leave the country applicable to those who received a suspended sentence was a “temporary measure designed to secure the enforcement of a criminal conviction”.

This requirement could not have been interpreted as including a ban on travel abroad. The applicant Mr Benyash submitted that the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority, which had been required of him, was not incompatible with short-term travel abroad for work, tourism or medical treatment. If he were to breach the conditions of his sentence by failing to report, the probation could have been revoked and his name would then have been placed on the list of fugitives from justice.

As to the necessity for the interference in a democratic society, the Government pointed out that the impugned measure responded to a pressing social need, that it was limited in time and could not be automatically extended. In their applications for travel documents and the ensuing judicial proceedings, the applicants did not refer to sufficiently specific, objective and valid grounds for leaving Russia. As regards the applicant Mr Vlasov, the Government submitted that he had been twice convicted of smuggling, that is to say of an activity connected with crossing the State border, and that there was accordingly a risk of reoffending. The restriction on his right to leave Russia was of a short duration, it applied in the period between 14 January 2009 and 20 March 2010, a total of one year and four months. The applicant Mr Benyash was convicted of a serious offence and subjected to certain restrictions for the entire duration of the probation period, including the obligation to report twice a month to the competent body.

In cases where the travel ban was the consequence of the applicant ’ s status as a convicted and not yet rehabilitated offender, the Court did not consider that such a general and almost automatic restriction could be regarded as necessary (see Milen Kostov v.

In particular, they gave no explanation why they believed that the travel ban was conducive to the applicants ’ rehabilitation or why a short-term absence on a trip abroad should have prevented Mr Benyash ’ s from complying with the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority.

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure in issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning “ State secrets ”. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration, and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of “ State secrets ” became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that “the test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ” (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph 30 above )."

                "38. The Court has next to determine whether the interference complained of was justified. It reiterates that Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4, which guarantees the right to leave any country, including one ’ s own, must be read subject to the third paragraph of that Article, which provides for certain restrictions that may be placed on the exercise of that right in the interests of, inter alia, national security or public safety. The Convention organs have previously accepted that restrictions imposed following a failure to comply with military service obligations (see Marangos v. Cyprus, no. 31106/96, Commission decision of 20 May 1997, unreported ), or restrictions on the travel of a mentally ill person who had no arrangements for appropriate care in the destination country (see Nordblad v. Sweden, no. 19076/91, Commission decision of 13 October 1993, unreported ), were permissible. The Court has dealt with the withdrawal of travel documents and passports in applications concerning criminal (or bankruptcy) proceedings against applicants or third parties (see, for example, Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). So far there has been no application to the Convention institutions where a person was denied the right to travel abroad on the sole ground of his or her knowledge of certain “State secrets”. The applicable test is nonetheless similar: in order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 such a restriction must be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281-A, and Napijalo, cited above, § 74 ).",

The undertaking of 16 May 1989 also contained a clause restricting his ability to travel abroad. The Russian Act of 15 August 1996 required agencies to sign new employment contracts with employees having access to sensitive information. That had not been done in the applicant ’ s case because the Act had come into force on 19 August 1996, that is to say, a day before the applicant ’ s employment ended."

On 14 August 1996 he had surrendered all these items to the agency. That was the last date on which he had had access to classified information. The restriction was of a temporary nature, spanning over five years after that date."

In other words, this requirement, commonly referred to as the test of proportionality, demands that restrictive measures should be appropriate to achieve their protective function ( compare with point 14 of the Human Rights Committee ’ s General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR, cited in paragraph 30 above)."

This was not contested by the respondent Government."

The Court further observes that the Russian law on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets imposed an unqualified restriction on their right to leave Russia, whatever the purpose or duration of their visit. Accordingly, the scope of review by the Inter - agency Commission and the domestic courts was confined to examination of the formal issue as to whether the information to which the applicant had once had access in the Raduga design agency was still sensitive. They did not consider whether the restriction on the applicant ’ s right to travel abroad for private purposes was still necessary for achieving the legitimate aim it had been intended to serve and whether a less restrictive measure could be applied."

            [
                "49. The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure in issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning “ State secrets ”. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration, and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of “ State secrets ” became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that “the test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ” (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph 30 above )."

The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe, as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 25 above). The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). However, Russia ’ s undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date (see paragraphs 22 and 34 above)."

Finally, the Court observes that the restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his country was imposed for a considerable period of time, for five years following the termination of his employment, notwithstanding the fact that that restriction was not explicitly mentioned in the 1994 undertaking (see paragraph 9 above). The impact of that measure must have been particularly heavy on the applicant because he had not been able to travel abroad since the beginning of his employment in 1977, that is, for a total of twenty-four years."

On that point, the Court reiterates that under Article 2 §§ 2 and 3 of Protocol No. 4 the authorities are under an obligation to ensure that a restriction of an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate. That assessment should normally be subject to review by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures. The scope of their review should enable them to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see Battista v.

Once satisfied that the prerequisites under section 15(4), namely conviction and lack of rehabilitation, were in place, the courts pronounced the travel ban to be lawful (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 17 above). They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above). In these circumstances, in the absence of reasons and proper judicial review of the question of proportionality by the domestic authorities, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or not there were grounds that could have justified the travel ban.

The applicants pointed out that section 15(4) of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act merely provided for the possibility of the right to leave Russia being restricted, rather than for actual restriction. The applicant Mr Vlasov emphasised that on 27 October 2008 the District Court had explicitly decided not to enforce the penalty, without imposing any other restriction apart from a requirement to report any changes in his place of residence. This requirement could not have been interpreted as including a ban on travel abroad. The applicant Mr Benyash submitted that the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority, which had been required of him, was not incompatible with short-term travel abroad for work, tourism or medical treatment. If he were to breach the conditions of his sentence by failing to report, the probation could have been revoked and his name would then have been placed on the list of fugitives from justice. He pointed out that the Government ’ s arguments were of a general, non-specific nature, and that they failed to indicate any public interest which might have been impaired in the event of his leaving abroad."

As to the necessity for the interference in a democratic society, the Government pointed out that the impugned measure responded to a pressing social need, that it was limited in time and could not be automatically extended. In their applications for travel documents and the ensuing judicial proceedings, the applicants did not refer to sufficiently specific, objective and valid grounds for leaving Russia. As regards the applicant Mr Vlasov, the Government submitted that he had been twice convicted of smuggling, that is to say of an activity connected with crossing the State border, and that there was accordingly a risk of reoffending. The restriction on his right to leave Russia was of a short duration, it applied in the period between 14 January 2009 and 20 March 2010, a total of one year and four months. The applicant Mr Benyash was convicted of a serious offence and subjected to certain restrictions for the entire duration of the probation period, including the obligation to report twice a month to the competent body.

The scope of their review should enable them to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see Battista v.

Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 - A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 - IV) or of an individual who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v.

They must be based on concrete elements which are truly indicative of the continued existence of the risk that such measures seek to forestall. In cases where the travel ban was the consequence of the applicant ’ s status as a convicted and not yet rehabilitated offender, the Court did not consider that such a general and almost automatic restriction could be regarded as necessary (see Milen Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 40026/07, § 17, 3 September 2013; Sarkizov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 37981/06, 38022/06, 39122/06, and 44278/06, § 67, 17 April 2012; and Nalbantski, cited above, § 66).

In the instant case, as in the above-mentioned cases against Bulgaria, the Russian authorities, apart from referring to the applicants ’ convictions and lack of rehabilitation, did not give any reasons for refusing them travel passports, without examining their individual situations or explaining the need to impose such a measure on them. They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicants ’ right to travel abroad and to provide justification for it (compare Milen Kostov, § 17, and Nalbantski, § 67, both cited above). In particular, they gave no explanation why they believed that the travel ban was conducive to the applicants ’ rehabilitation or why a short-term absence on a trip abroad should have prevented Mr Benyash ’ s from complying with the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority. The Court reiterates that the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country (see Nalbantski, cited above, § 67)."

Once satisfied that the prerequisites under section 15(4), namely conviction and lack of rehabilitation, were in place, the courts pronounced the travel ban to be lawful (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 17 above). They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above). In these circumstances, in the absence of reasons and proper judicial review of the question of proportionality by the domestic authorities, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or not there were grounds that could have justified the travel ban.

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v.

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria.

On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v.

A similar issue arose in respect of the appeals against the Sofia Court of Appeal's decision to re ‑ impose the ban on 27 June 2007; they had been declared inadmissible in spite of the express wording of Article 68 § 6 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure."

As regards the initial ban, which lasted from 7 February 2001 until 26 May 2006 (see paragraphs 24 and 38 above), it should first be noted that under Article 153a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in force until 29 April 2006 (see paragraph 45 above), the applicant was not able to challenge the ban as such, but only to seek permission to travel on specific occasions. The possibility to seek the lifting of the ban as a whole became available only when Article 68 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure came into force (see paragraph 46 above). However, in so far as the requests for permission to travel on specific occasions – which could be made at any time without restriction – were capable of relieving the effect which the ban had on the applicant, they could be regarded as remedies against it. The salient question is whether they were effective."

The chief issue here seems to be whether the courts examined the applicant's requests and ensuing appeals with sufficient thoroughness and with reference to the factors relevant to the justification of the ban under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener, cited above, § 141). As can be seen from the bulk of their rulings, they were essentially content to rely on the justification that the applicant stood accused of a serious offence carrying a severe penalty and he had been extradited from Germany. With two notable exceptions – the decisions of 26 August 2003 and 28 February 2005 – they treated as irrelevant, or did not even mention, many of his arguments that had a direct bearing on the justification for the measure (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 37 above). An analogy may be drawn with the Court's case ‑ law under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, where the national courts'failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pre ‑ trial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, §§ 58 and 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ II, and Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, §§ 64 and 65, 13 November 2008 ).

However, as to the allegation that the remedy was not effective because on one occasion the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal held that no appeal lay against the trial court's refusal to grant permission to travel (see paragraph 29 in fine above), the Court observes that the applicant could have challenged that ruling before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 45 in fine above)."

However, it remained open to the applicant to ask the same court to lift the ban (see paragraph 46 above), which he did successfully in March 2008 (see paragraph 41 above). There is nothing to suggest that an earlier application would have been less likely to succeed. Given that in certain circumstances the aggregate of remedies provided by national law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 77, Series A no. 116, and Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v.

Moreover, the court found it uncertain how clear or strong the applicant ’ s will actually was, taking into account the evidence regarding his gullibility. It was likely that his opinion was influenced by that of the former foster parents. The applicant ’ s development had improved in his home town and he had been able to live in a special unit for intellectually disabled adults, to go to work and to cycle independently around town. The applicant had in his home town a support network consisting of relatives, friends and staff of the social welfare authorities, a job, hobbies and educational possibilities. Due to the remote and isolated location of the former foster parents ’ home, the applicant would miss out on all these possibilities if he were to move there.

Preference is to be given to the ward ’ s interests and to the need to safeguard the ward ’ s opportunities to participate in the decision-making concerning him or her. The principle of respect for human dignity is supplemented by the principles of necessity and proportionality. The principle of necessity means that the ward must be permitted to maintain his or her legal competence as extensively as possible, and that that competence can be restricted only to the extent necessary to protect the ward. The principle of proportionality means that the measures to protect the ward must be determined on a case-by-case basis and according to the need for such protection. On the other hand, it may be necessary to restrict the right of self-determination of the ward in certain situations in order to protect his or her own interests.

Otherwise such an appointment would be pointless. The partial dismissal of the applicant ’ s mentor would not be decisive for his right to respect for private life or family life.

The Mental Disability Advocacy Centre noted that States were required to ensure that the will and preferences of persons with disabilities were respected at all times and could not be overridden or ignored by paternalistic “best interests ” decision-making. The will and preferences expressed by persons with disabilities in respect of their family relationships and their right to choose their place of residence had to be respected and protected as these issues were an inherent part of a person ’ s autonomy, independence, dignity and self-development and central to a person ’ s independent living in a wider community. In order to ensure that persons with disabilities were both protected from violations and that they had the ability to obtain effective remedies when violations occurred, States had a positive obligation to apply stringent and effective safeguards in order to ensure that their rights to exercise legal capacity were “practical and effective” rather than “theoretical and illusory”."

The starting point, based on the current international standards, was that the will and preferences of a person with disabilities should take precedence over other considerations when it came to decisions affecting that person. This was clear from the text of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Even in jurisdictions with a former reliance on the “ best interests ” approach, there was an emerging trend towards placing more emphasis on the will and preferences of the person. There was a clear move from a “ best-interests ” model to a “ supported decision-making ” approach."

Article 8 § 2 of the Convention needed to be interpreted in a manner consistent with international standards, taking into account the international recognition of the importance of autonomy and supported decision-making for individuals with disabilities. Rights guaranteed in Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention were closely intertwined with those of Article 8. Circumstances in which an interference would be justified were limited and had to be restrictively construed. Persons with disabilities needed to be able to choose where and with whom to live, and had to be given the opportunity to live independently in the community on the basis of their own choice and, on an equal basis with others."

The Court observes that the main issue in the present case concerns the refusal of the domestic authorities to allow a partial change in the applicant ’ s mentor arrangements, requested with a view to permitting the applicant to decide for himself where and with whom to live. The Court must consider this matter in the light of the general principles governing interferences by State authorities in the private and family life of individuals guaranteed under Article 8 of the Convention, taking into account the principles governing the State ’ s positive obligations, especially those relating to the protection of particularly vulnerable persons. The Court notes that the applicant has not lodged a complaint under Article 14 of the Convention. However, due to the nature and scope of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 8, lodged by an intellectually disabled young man, the Court considers that within the particular context of its examination regard must be had to the requirement of non-discrimination, bearing in mind that discriminatory treatment can consist of treating differently persons in relevantly comparable situations without an objective and reasonable justification, or of failing to make, without objective and reasonable justification, differentiations between persons whose situations are not relevantly comparable (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV).",

            [
                "71. However, Article 8 does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see, inter alia, Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 78, ECHR 2013; and Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 32, Series A no. 32 ). The principles applicable to assessing a State ’ s positive and negative obligations under the Convention are similar. Regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests, the aims in the second paragraph of Article 8 being of a certain relevance (see Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 65, ECHR 2014; and Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, § 165, ECHR 2016 ). The positive obligations may also require measures designed to provide special protection to persons who are in a particularly vulnerable position (see, for example, Paposhvili v.

As regards this aspect of the case, the Court recalls that discrimination means treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007-IV; and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008)."

The Court further recalls its findings to the effect that where a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State ’ s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question (see Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 63, ECHR 2011 ). The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs (see Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010 ). In the past, the Court has identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their sex (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 78, Series A no. 94; and Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 27, Series A no. 280 ‑ B ), sexual orientation (see Schalk and Kopf v.

The applicant ’ s complaint, in essence, is directed at the fact that by their decisions in the impugned proceedings, the domestic courts refused to change the mentor arrangements as a result of which the applicant was restrained from deciding for himself where and with whom to live.

In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 108, ECHR 2013 (extracts))."

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that under Finnish law, the appointment of a mentor does not entail a deprivation or restriction of the legal capacity of the person for whom the mentor is designated (see paragraph 2 9 above). The powers of the mentor to represent the ward cover the latter ’ s property and financial affairs to the extent set out in the appointing court ’ s order, but these powers do not exclude the ward ’ s capacity to act for him - or herself. If, like in the present case, the court has specifically ordered that the mentor ’ s function shall also cover matters pertaining to the ward ’ s person, the mentor is competent to represent the ward in such a matter only where the latter is unable to understand its significance (see paragraph 30 above). In a context such as the present one, the interference with the applicant ’ s freedom to choose where and with whom to live that resulted from the appointment and retention of a mentor for him was therefore solely contingent on the determination that the applicant was unable to understand the significance of that particular issue. This determination in turn depended on the assessment of the applicant ’ s intellectual capacity in conjunction with and in relation to all the aspects of that specific issue. The Court also notes that Finland, having recently ratified the UNCRPD, has done so while expressly considering that there was no need or cause to amend the current legislation in these respects (see Government Bill HE 284/2014 vp., p. 45)."

In essence, the decision was not based on a qualification of the applicant as a person with a disability. Instead, the decision was based on the finding that, in this particular case, the disability was of a kind that, in terms of its effects on the applicant ’ s cognitive skills, rendered the applicant unable to adequately understand the significance and the implications of the specific decision he wished to take, and that therefore, the applicant ’ s well-being and interests required that the mentor arrangement be maintained."

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above).

The Court reiterates that, as in the Bartik case, the confidential information which the applicant possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require his presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. The Government's claim that the applicant would be abducted by foreign intelligence services or terrorist organisations while abroad appears to be mere conjecture not supported by any actual assessment of the security risks in the applicant's individual case because of the blanket nature of the prohibition on private international travel in respect of all those who, like the applicant, had had access to State secrets in the past."

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 28, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 50 and 51, Reports 1998 ‑ I; Hadjianastassiou v.

Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 2 2 October 2009 ), such a restriction must in all cases be commensurate with its protective function.

The applicant has been affected by the restriction on his right to travel abroad for a considerable period of time, that is, for more than five years following the termination of his employment. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant was made to bear a disproportionate burden which undermined the essence of his right under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 and which not necessary in democratic society."

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicant ’ s personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, the Court must ascertain whether the applicant had a genuine interest in leaving his country of residence or actually sought to leave and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused ( see Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above, § 44 )."

However, no actual proof for these claims or for any possible loss of income caused by the preventive measure was provided by the applicant. In addition, the applicant admitted in his submissions before the Court that his wife, children and his mother reside in his home town in Romania. At the same time, according to the documents submitted by the parties, the domestic courts thoroughly analysed the applicant ’ s submissions and found that the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement was justified in the specific circumstances of his case.

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicant ’ s personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, the Court must ascertain whether the applicant had a genuine interest in leaving his country of residence or actually sought to leave and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused ( see Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above, § 44 )."

In addition, the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the prolonged application of the preventive measure before the courts, pleading first that the measure had prevented him from obtaining a job and subsequently that it had prevented him from carrying out his job, which involved travel abroad. However, no actual proof for these claims or for any possible loss of income caused by the preventive measure was provided by the applicant. In addition, the applicant admitted in his submissions before the Court that his wife, children and his mother reside in his home town in Romania. At the same time, according to the documents submitted by the parties, the domestic courts thoroughly analysed the applicant ’ s submissions and found that the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement was justified in the specific circumstances of his case. On this point, the Court also notes that the applicant is currently at large after failing to return to serve the remainder of his prison sentence. In view of the above, the Court sees no reason to depart from the findings of the domestic courts in the present case.

It follows that these complaints were introduced out of time.

In the Court's view, an obligation not to leave the area of one's residence is a minimally intrusive restriction of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v. Hungary (dec.), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004 ).

The resulting delay of approximately two years and eleven months between 23 August 2001, when the Centre was first requested to carry out the examination, and 30 July 2004, when the trial court eventually received the completed expert examination, was thus attributable to the domestic authorities.

It follows that these complaints were introduced out of time. Finally, as to the measure of restraint in the form of an undertaking not to leave her place of residence during the proceedings, the Court recalls that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused, including deprivation of liberty, in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution. In the Court's view, an obligation not to leave the area of one's residence is a minimally intrusive restriction of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v. Hungary (dec.), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004 ). Since it does not appear that the applicant actually sought to leave the area of her residence and was refused (see, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, § § 44-46, 13 October 2005 ) or that the overall duration of that measure – seven years and two months to date – was unjustifiably long (see, by contrast, Luordo v.

The Government further stressed the complex nature of the proceedings against the applicant, the number of witnesses who had to be heard and the need for the applicant to be present at the trial. They also relied on a series of cases against Italy (see Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00; Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96; and Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99) where the length of proceedings varied between thirteen years and six months and twenty-four years and five months, and where violations were found by the Court, and compared them with the case of Fedorov and Fedorova v.

He further submitted that he had filed nine requests for the preventive measure imposed on the applicant to be lifted, and all of them had been refused. The courts likewise refused to grant the applicant permission to leave Poland for a short period of time to see his children and to take care of his most urgent affairs. The lawyer further maintained that the applicant had appeared at court for all the hearings, and that he had given no reasons for suspicion that he would abscond or obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings in any other way. As regards the Court’s case-law relied on by the Government, the applicant’s lawyer pointed to two crucial differences between the circumstances of the case of Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia and the present case. Firstly, in the case relied on by the Government one of the applicants was twice granted permission to leave her place of residence for a short period of time. Secondly, in the present case, the applicant was a citizen of another country, who had been forced to remain in Poland for over six years (including the period of his pre-trial detention).

In Luordo the Court found such an obligation, imposed on the applicant for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, disproportionate because of the length of the proceedings, in that case fourteen years and eight months, even though there had been no indication that the applicant had wished to leave his place of residence or that such permission had ever been refused. This approach was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave the territory of the respondent State varied between more than five years ( Prescher v. Bulgaria no. 6767/04, § 47, 7 June 2011) and more than ten years (see Riener v. Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 106, 23 May 2006)."

However, the Court considers that, in the present case, the comparative duration of the restriction in itself cannot be taken as the sole basis for determining whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicant’s personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement. This issue must be assessed according to all the special features of the case. The restriction may be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual’s right to freedom of movement (see Hayibeyli v.

Taking into account the number of co-accused and the number of witnesses to be heard (see paragraph 9 above) the Court accepts that the case is of a certain complexity.

At the same time, the Court notes that the proceedings against the applicant have been pending for a considerable time and no first-instance judgment has yet been given.

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

The only relevant factor in that respect was the conduct of the accused during the proceedings. The court noted that the applicant had not obstructed the proceedings against him in any way since his release from detention, that the evidence against him was contradictory and that his family life had suffered serious disruption on account of a measure which could not be maintained forever.

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria.

On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v.

A further problem was the uncertainty, illustrated by the conflicting decisions of the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal on that point, as to whether the rulings of the trial court under Article 153a § 5 of that Code were subject to appeal. A similar issue arose in respect of the appeals against the Sofia Court of Appeal's decision to re ‑ impose the ban on 27 June 2007; they had been declared inadmissible in spite of the express wording of Article 68 § 6 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure."

As regards the initial ban, which lasted from 7 February 2001 until 26 May 2006 (see paragraphs 24 and 38 above), it should first be noted that under Article 153a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in force until 29 April 2006 (see paragraph 45 above), the applicant was not able to challenge the ban as such, but only to seek permission to travel on specific occasions. The possibility to seek the lifting of the ban as a whole became available only when Article 68 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure came into force (see paragraph 46 above). However, in so far as the requests for permission to travel on specific occasions – which could be made at any time without restriction – were capable of relieving the effect which the ban had on the applicant, they could be regarded as remedies against it. The salient question is whether they were effective."

                "71. The chief issue here seems to be whether the courts examined the applicant's requests and ensuing appeals with sufficient thoroughness and with reference to the factors relevant to the justification of the ban under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener, cited above, § 141). As can be seen from the bulk of their rulings, they were essentially content to rely on the justification that the applicant stood accused of a serious offence carrying a severe penalty and he had been extradited from Germany. With two notable exceptions – the decisions of 26 August 2003 and 28 February 2005 – they treated as irrelevant, or did not even mention, many of his arguments that had a direct bearing on the justification for the measure (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 37 above). An analogy may be drawn with the Court's case ‑ law under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, where the national courts'failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pre ‑ trial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, §§ 58 and 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ II, and Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, §§ 64 and 65, 13 November 2008 ). In the Court's view, the domestic courts'stance stripped the remedy of its effectiveness."

However, as to the allegation that the remedy was not effective because on one occasion the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal held that no appeal lay against the trial court's refusal to grant permission to travel (see paragraph 29 in fine above), the Court observes that the applicant could have challenged that ruling before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 45 in fine above)."

As to the renewed ban, which started on 27 June 2007, the Court notes that the applicant's appeal against the court order imposing the ban was declared inadmissible – apparently erroneously in terms of Bulgarian law – on the ground that no appeal lay against it (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above). However, it remained open to the applicant to ask the same court to lift the ban (see paragraph 46 above), which he did successfully in March 2008 (see paragraph 41 above). There is nothing to suggest that an earlier application would have been less likely to succeed. Given that in certain circumstances the aggregate of remedies provided by national law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 77, Series A no. 116, and Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v. Bulgaria, no. 14134/02, § 67, ECHR 2007 ‑ XI), the Court concludes that the applicant did have an effective remedy against that ban."

However, the risk with such a system is that it may unreasonably restrict the applicant's freedom to move freely, particularly if the proceedings are protracted, as they were in the instant case in which they lasted fourteen years and eight months. In that connection, referring to its findings with respect to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court finds that, contrary to what the Government have affirmed, the delays in the proceedings were not attributable to the failure of the attempts to sell the applicant's house at auction or to the applicant's conduct.",

Even though there is nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant wished to move away from his place of residence or was refused permission to do so, in the Court's view, the length of the proceedings upset the balance that had to be struck between the general interest in securing the payment of the bankrupt's creditors and the applicant's personal interest in having freedom of movement.

The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see Iatridis v.

There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III, and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 49)."

However, it finds that those actions did not significantly slow down the bankruptcy proceedings because, apart from the request for a composition with the creditors (the date of which has not been given), all the applications were made in or after 1996 and were decided expeditiously by the courts concerned (for instance, the application for a referral to the Constitutional Court was decided within twelve days and the application for a stay of the order for sale within one day).",

In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 17-18, §§ 35-36). This right extends only to disputes (“ contestation ”) over “civil rights and obligations ” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, § 81, and Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, pp. 16-17, § 36)."

However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person's access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Levages Prestations Services v.

Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court's view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the bankrupt estate.

In that connection, referring to its findings with respect to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court finds that, contrary to what the Government have affirmed, the delays in the proceedings were not attributable to the failure of the attempts to sell the applicant's house at auction or to the applicant's conduct.",

Even though there is nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant wished to move away from his place of residence or was refused permission to do so, in the Court's view, the length of the proceedings upset the balance that had to be struck between the general interest in securing the payment of the bankrupt's creditors and the applicant's personal interest in having freedom of movement.

In his view, the judgment of 1980 in Catalano constituted an isolated decision, concerning a preventive measure which had not been fully implemented because the individual in question had been authorised to move abroad. The judgment of 25 May 2000 dealt with the suspension of the preventive measure by reason of the detention of the person concerned in a prison. The applicant considered that the Court of Cassation ’ s judgment of 16 December 1996 quashing the decision of the Lecce Court of Appeal was not the result of a change in the case-law, but on the contrary a further statement of the correct interpretation of section 11 of Law no. 1423/56."

In this respect, it observes that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees the “choice of the legislature” and that the word “legislature” does not necessarily mean the national parliament: it has to be interpreted in the light of the constitutional structure of the State in question (see Cherepkov v. Russia (dec.), no. 51501/ 99, ECHR 2000-I). In Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, the 1980 constitutional reform had vested in the Flemish Council sufficient competence and powers to make it, alongside the French Community Council and the Walloon Regional Council, a constituent part of the Belgian “legislature”, in addition to the House of Representatives and the Senate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.

Although those rights are important, they are not absolute. Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them forth in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for implied limitations. In their internal legal orders, the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of this provision of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see the following judgments: Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, p. 23, § 52; Gitonas and Others v.

They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above).

The first claimant had been given a suspended sentence and the second claimant had been released on parole on condition that he found employment and abstained from changing his place of residence without notifying the probation authority.",
                "The Constitutional Court held that enforcement of final convictions was a constitutionally important objective, as a failure to enforce them would undermine the rights of others and the authority of the judiciary. A suspended sentence does not mean that the convicted offender has been exempted from punishment: he or she is on probation during the specified period of time and may be subject to additional restrictions during that period (Articles 73 and 86(3) of the Criminal Code). The Constitutional Court inferred therefrom that the restriction on the right to leave the country applicable to those who received a suspended sentence was a “temporary measure designed to secure the enforcement of a criminal conviction”. Similarly, as regards the situation of individuals released on parole, the Constitutional Court considered that a temporary restriction on their right to leave Russia was a safeguard necessary to secure the full enforcement of the sentence.",
                "Since the probation authorities only have jurisdiction within the Russian territory, they can only exercise effective control over the conduct of convicted offenders on probation within Russia. A convicted offender ’ s departure from Russia would remove them from the sphere of such control, undermining the objectives of the punishment and negating the established procedure for enforcement of the sentence as a means of rehabilitating offenders.",

The applicant Mr Vlasov emphasised that on 27 October 2008 the District Court had explicitly decided not to enforce the penalty, without imposing any other restriction apart from a requirement to report any changes in his place of residence. This requirement could not have been interpreted as including a ban on travel abroad. The applicant Mr Benyash submitted that the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority, which had been required of him, was not incompatible with short-term travel abroad for work, tourism or medical treatment. If he were to breach the conditions of his sentence by failing to report, the probation could have been revoked and his name would then have been placed on the list of fugitives from justice. He pointed out that the Government ’ s arguments were of a general, non-specific nature, and that they failed to indicate any public interest which might have been impaired in the event of his leaving abroad."

As to the necessity for the interference in a democratic society, the Government pointed out that the impugned measure responded to a pressing social need, that it was limited in time and could not be automatically extended. In their applications for travel documents and the ensuing judicial proceedings, the applicants did not refer to sufficiently specific, objective and valid grounds for leaving Russia. As regards the applicant Mr Vlasov, the Government submitted that he had been twice convicted of smuggling, that is to say of an activity connected with crossing the State border, and that there was accordingly a risk of reoffending. The restriction on his right to leave Russia was of a short duration, it applied in the period between 14 January 2009 and 20 March 2010, a total of one year and four months. The applicant Mr Benyash was convicted of a serious offence and subjected to certain restrictions for the entire duration of the probation period, including the obligation to report twice a month to the competent body.

A measure by means of which an individual is denied the use of a document which, had he so wished, would have permitted him to leave the country, amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 and must meet the requirements of paragraph 3 of that Article (see Bartik v. Russia, no. 55565/00, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV, and Napijalo v. Croatia, no. 66485/01, § 68, 13 November 2003)."

The Court, for its part, does not find it necessary to determine whether the measure was “ in accordance with law”, as, for the reasons that follow, it considers that it was incompatible with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 in other respects (see Nalbantski v.

That assessment should normally be subject to review by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures. The scope of their review should enable them to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see Battista v.

Thus, the Court has allowed restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals suspected of being members of a criminal syndicate (see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 - A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 - IV) or of an individual who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v.

However, such restrictions can be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual ’ s right to freedom of movement. They must be based on concrete elements which are truly indicative of the continued existence of the risk that such measures seek to forestall. In cases where the travel ban was the consequence of the applicant ’ s status as a convicted and not yet rehabilitated offender, the Court did not consider that such a general and almost automatic restriction could be regarded as necessary (see Milen Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 40026/07, § 17, 3 September 2013; Sarkizov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 37981/06, 38022/06, 39122/06, and 44278/06, § 67, 17 April 2012; and Nalbantski, cited above, § 66). The Court also found a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 in a case where a travel restriction had been automatically imposed on account of unpaid debts, without examining the applicant ’ s personal situation or his ability to pay the amounts due (see Battista, cited above, § 44)."

In the instant case, as in the above-mentioned cases against Bulgaria, the Russian authorities, apart from referring to the applicants ’ convictions and lack of rehabilitation, did not give any reasons for refusing them travel passports, without examining their individual situations or explaining the need to impose such a measure on them. They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicants ’ right to travel abroad and to provide justification for it (compare Milen Kostov, § 17, and Nalbantski, § 67, both cited above). In particular, they gave no explanation why they believed that the travel ban was conducive to the applicants ’ rehabilitation or why a short-term absence on a trip abroad should have prevented Mr Benyash ’ s from complying with the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority. The Court reiterates that the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country (see Nalbantski, cited above, § 67)."

                "36. In the subsequent judicial review proceedings the Russian courts only concerned themselves with the formal lawfulness of the ban. Once satisfied that the prerequisites under section 15(4), namely conviction and lack of rehabilitation, were in place, the courts pronounced the travel ban to be lawful (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 17 above). They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above). In these circumstances, in the absence of reasons and proper judicial review of the question of proportionality by the domestic authorities, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or not there were grounds that could have justified the travel ban. The alleged risk of reoffending in the case of Mr Vlasov, to which the Government referred, was not mentioned in any form in the domestic decisions and was cited for the first time in the proceedings before this Court."

Ukraine that the proceedings at issue concerned a “dispute between a prosecutor and the court and the applicant had not been a party to it” (see no. 65518/01, § 72, 6 September 2005 ). In their observations in the present case the Government stated that the applicants “supported” the decision of 22 June 1998 and “did not oppose” that of 20 April 2000. The secondary role of the applicants in these proceedings is further demonstrated by the fact that they, unlike the prosecution, had no right of appeal against the court ’ s decisions to remit the case for further investigation (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, on both occasions, once the Kyiv City Court quashed the decisions to reinstitute the investigation in the case, the case-file was remitted to the trial court with considerable delays.

Ukraine, no. 36655/02, § 69, 8 November 2005). In this context, the Court reiterates that an accused in criminal proceedings should be entitled to have his case conducted with special diligence, having a particular regard to any restrictions on liberty imposed pending the conclusion of the proceedings (see Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, § 89, 2 March 2006, and Ivanov, cited above, § 71). Article 6 of the Convention requires the courts to employ available procedural remedies in order to determine a person ’ s guilt or innocence without undue delay. This requirement is aimed at removing as soon as practicable the uncertainty concerning the accused ’ s legal position which remains throughout the entire duration of the proceedings, irrespective of whether they are pending or suspended. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that, despite the fact that it was the applicant who requested the suspension of the proceedings, the primary responsibility for the delay caused by the suspensions, which in turn were caused by the pending commercial proceedings, rested with the domestic courts."
