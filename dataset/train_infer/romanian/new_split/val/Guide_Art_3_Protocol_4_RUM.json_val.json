                "The applicants were arrested on various dates early in the morning at their homes or at their work. After their arrest, they were taken to the police station in Limassol and then to what they believed were the CIS headquarters in Nicosia, with the exception of Taşer Kişmir and İlker Tufansoy, who were taken directly to Nicosia. The applicants were mostly arrested by CIS officers whom they knew. After being kept in Nicosia for a while, towards noon they were taken to a police station in a mountain area, presumably that of Troodos/Kambos, although the applicants’ oral testimony does not allow the Court to identify precisely the village in which the police station was located. The applicants were kept in that police station for the whole afternoon. In the evening, between 8 and 9 p.m., the applicants were taken to a dry riverbed and expelled to the north under threat that if they came back they would be killed. Then they crossed the buffer-zone and reached the northern part of the island in the Angolemi/Taşpınar area, where they were apprehended by Turkish soldiers who handed them over to the “TRNC” police. Because they were wounded, the “TRNC” police took them to hospital and then detained them on remand. The applicants appear to have been taken, although not by force, to be examined by United Nations doctors. They were also interviewed by the United Nations civilian police.",

A test of the applicant’s urine showed a large amount of blood which could, in the doctor’s view, be consistent with a recent trauma. As to the amputation of the fourth toe of the left foot, the doctor noted in her report that, if the foot had been stamped on, “it would be more likely that the first or fifth toe would be injured and not the fourth”.

The Court reiterates its settled case-law that under the Convention system prior to 1 November 1998 the establishment and verification of facts was primarily a matter for the Commission (former Articles 28 § 1 and 31 of the Convention). In the instant case, however, although a delegation of the Commission heard evidence in Cyprus (see paragraph 10 above), the Commission did not adopt a report under former Article 31 by 1 November 1999 (see paragraph 7 above). The Court is therefore required, in accordance with Article 5 § 3 in fine of Protocol No. 11 and Rule 99 § 5 of the Rules of Court, to assess the evidence and establish the facts in the light of all the material before it. The following general considerations are relevant in this context.",
                "(i) The Court has based its findings on the evidence given orally before the Commission delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings; in the assessment of whether or not the applicants’ allegations are well-founded, the standard of proof is that of “beyond reasonable doubt”. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact; in addition, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161).",
                "(ii) In relation to the oral evidence, the Court is aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters: it has therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before the Commission delegates. In relation to both the written and the oral evidence, the Court is aware that the cultural context in which some of the applicants and witnesses live has rendered inevitable a certain imprecision with regard to dates and other details (in particular, numerical matters), and it does not consider that this by itself affects the credibility of the testimonies.",
                "(iii) In a case where there are contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Court is acutely aware of its own shortcomings as a first-instance tribunal of fact. The problems of language are adverted to above; there is also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region. In addition, neither the Commission nor the Court had powers of compulsion as regards the attendance of witnesses. In the present case, while twenty-eight witnesses were summoned to appear, five of them failed to give evidence before the Commission delegates. The Court has therefore been faced with the difficult task of determining events in the absence of potentially significant testimony.",

In particular, the Court notes that, despite their written testimonies made before the Cypriot authorities denying the allegations, the applicants confirmed their original allegations before the Commission delegates, describing the events in detail and with very few discrepancies.

It notes that they came for the purpose of finding jobs and to live there. Panayiota Papachristophorou alleged that on 17 April 1994 she had given Aziz money for a taxi to go to the northern part of the island and pick up a number of Turkish Cypriots, but that on the same day, late in the evening, she was displeased to see Aziz bring so many people to her house. She alleged that Aziz had brought all the Turkish Cypriots to her house, that is, Hüseyin Mavideniz, his wife and their children, Doğan Davulcular, his wife and their children, and Hüseyin Davulcular, his wife and their children. As a consequence, on 18 April 1994, as early as 8 a.m., she allegedly gave them money for a taxi to return to the north. The Court considers that this version lacks credibility and discloses a desire to establish her sole responsibility for the return of those people to the northern part of the island on the same day.",

On the other hand, no other explanation has been provided by the Government as to why those who stayed at the house of Yılmaz Mavideniz should have decided to go back to the north early in the morning on the day after their arrival.",

However, on 3 September 1998, Andreas Spatalos submitted six statements to the Commission delegates (see paragraph 285 above) and claimed that, on various dates, six Turkish Cypriots went to the police stations in Limassol (İlker Denizci, Erbay Kaptanoğlu, Yılmaz Mavideniz and Süleyman Seyer) and Paphos (İlker Tufansoy and Taşer Kişmir) and signed these statements, as they wanted to go to the northern part of the island. His assertion that the statements were filled in by various police officers in Paphos and in Limassol is, however, contradicted by the examination of the statements, which shows that the handwriting in the forms is the same on all of them. Taking also into account that the CIS officers heard by the Commission confirmed that each CIS officer was attached to a particular police station, the oral testimony of the applicants to the effect that they signed the statements at the same police station, namely that of the Troodos/Kambos area, is therefore entirely credible."

However, in his oral evidence, he alleged that he went to the northern part to see his mother who was ill. The Court also notes other striking inconsistencies in Murat Doksandokuz’s statements. In particular, in his statement to the Cypriot police, he alleged that it was Erbay Kaptanoğlu who had spoken on his behalf, but not with his consent, to the journalists gathered at Nicosia Hospital in northern Cyprus. The witness did not mention this at all before the delegates, adding that he could not remember which version of the facts he had presented to the United Nations investigators. The Court also finds particularly obscure the description of his arrest by the “TRNC” police, who allegedly took him to the airport together with about one hundred persons, among whom was also Erbay Kaptanoğlu (see paragraph 250 above).

The applicants were mostly arrested by CIS officers whom they knew. After being kept in Nicosia for a while, towards noon they were taken to a police station in a mountain area, presumably that of Troodos/Kambos, although the applicants’ oral testimony does not allow the Court to identify precisely the village in which the police station was located. The applicants were kept in that police station for the whole afternoon. In the evening, between 8 and 9 p.m., the applicants were taken to a dry riverbed and expelled to the north under threat that if they came back they would be killed. Then they crossed the buffer-zone and reached the northern part of the island in the Angolemi/Taşpınar area, where they were apprehended by Turkish soldiers who handed them over to the “TRNC” police. Because they were wounded, the “TRNC” police took them to hospital and then detained them on remand.

The Government objected that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 of the Convention, by making proper use of the available means of redress through the institution of a private prosecution or a civil action for damages against the Republic, including punitive damages and an injunction, along with the lodging of a complaint with the Ombudsman and the Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives for further investigation and action. The Government stressed that these remedies were effective and submitted a non-exhaustive list of criminal cases filed by the police following complaints made by Turkish Cypriots which proved, in the Government’s view, that where the Cypriot authorities had the cooperation and assistance of Turkish Cypriots the latter had effective access to the criminal courts in Cyprus. In this respect, the Government rebutted the allegations that the Attorney-General had failed to conduct an investigation, but submitted that, due to the applicants’ refusal to cooperate, any inquiry by the Attorney-General’s Office with a view to the prosecution of suspects would have been fruitless. The Government also submitted examples of cases filed in the civil courts by various Turkish Cypriots against Greek-Cypriot defendants to prove that Turkish Cypriots had access to the civil courts in Cyprus."

However, although Article 35 § 1 requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, it does not require that recourse should be had to remedies that are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

Despite this information, the Attorney-General of the Republic of Cyprus at no time inquired into any of these allegations, although he had and still has the power to conduct such an inquiry ex officio (see paragraph 312 above).

Having regard to the Attorney-General’s refusal to take any action, the Court decided that the applicant’s complaint to the Ombudsman had not discharged the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus of the duty to “undertake an investigation capable of leading to the punishment (as opposed to the mere identification) of those responsible” (see Egmez, § 67).",
