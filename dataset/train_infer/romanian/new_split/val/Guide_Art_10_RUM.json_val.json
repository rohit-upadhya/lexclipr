For example, it has considered that the public display of several items of dirty clothing for a short time near Parliament, which had been meant to represent the “dirty laundry of the nation”, amounted to a form of political expression (see Tatár and Fáber v. Hungary, no. 26005/08 and 26160/08, § 36, 12 June 2012). Likewise, it has found that pouring paint on statues of Ataturk was an expressive act performed as a protest against the political regime at the time (see Murat Vural v. Turkey, no. 9540/07, §§ 54-56, 21 October 2014). Detaching a ribbon from a wreath laid by the President of Ukraine at a monument to a famous Ukrainian poet on Independence Day has also been regarded by the Court as a form of political expression (see Shvydka v. Ukraine, no. 17888/12, §§ 37-38, 30 October 2014)."

According to him, the aim of the protest was to draw public attention to the corruption and the control exercised by politicians over the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. At 10 a.m. he started his protest by installing two large wooden sculptures on the stairs of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. The first sculpture represented an erect penis with a picture of the face of a high-ranking politician attached to its head. The sculpture had a white collar and a tie and measured two metres. The second sculpture represented a large vulva with pictures of several high ‑ ranking prosecutors between the labia.

The sentence was suspended for a period of three years. In deciding on the sanction to be applied, the court took into consideration the fact that the applicant had previously been sanctioned with fines for similar deeds and that those sanctions had proved to be inefficient. The court considered that the applicant ’ s deeds had been immoral because he had exposed obscene sculptures in a public place where they could be seen by anyone, including by children. The court based its findings on the statements of several prosecution witnesses who had stated that they had disliked the sculptures exposed by the applicant and had considered them to be indecent and obscene. The court also stated that assimilating public officials with genitals went beyond the acceptable limits of criticism in a democratic society and was therefore not an act protected under Article 10 of the Convention. Moreover, the accusations meant to be made by the applicant by means of his protest against the officials concerned lacked a factual basis and had been contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence."

He reiterated that his protest had been against the corruption within the Prosecutor General ’ s Office and among high-ranking politicians, a phenomenon which was universally known and did not need to be proved. He also argued that the sculptures exposed by him could not be considered obscene. In any event, at the time of his protest, children were normally at schools and kindergartens. The fact that some of the prosecution witnesses disliked what they saw was not sufficient to hold him responsible for a criminal offence. The applicant admitted that the form of the protest chosen by him had been striking, however he considered this manner of protesting as the only way possible to make himself heard in a society which was oversaturated with subjects of discussion. The applicant finally submitted that the sanction applied to him had been disproportionately harsh and that it had had a chilling effect on him. He pointed to the fact that the first - instance court had admitted to having pursued the goal of discouraging his future involvement in protests. By the application of a suspended sentence, he had in fact been forced to abstain from organising further protests for a period of three years or risk being imprisoned."

The Court takes note of the domestic courts ’ finding that the sculptures exposed in public by the applicant were obscene and their classification of that act as hooliganism within the meaning of the Moldovan law. However, the domestic courts failed to explain in a satisfactory manner why they opted for the criminal sanction provided for by Article 287 of the Criminal Code and not for that provided for by Article 354 of the Code of Administrative Offences.

This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression, as protected by Article 10 of the Convention (for an analysis of the relevant principles in more detail, see Gündüz v.

In the Court ’ s view, the circumstances of the instant case present no justification whatsoever for the imposition of a prison sentence. Such a sanction, by its very nature, not only had negative repercussions on the applicant but it could also have a serious chilling effect on other persons and discourage them from exercising their freedom of expression.

Turning to the Government ’ s objection that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that it has considered the rule contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention to consist of three criteria. Firstly, has the applicant suffered a “significant disadvantage”? Secondly, does respect for human rights compel the Court to examine the case? Thirdly, has the case been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see Smith v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 54357/15, § 44, 28 March 2017)?"

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

Romania, no. 27329/06, § 56, 24 June 2014). In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v.

At the same time the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise that there is a difference between the reputational interests of a legal entity and the reputation of an individual as a member of society. Whereas the latter may have repercussions on one ’ s dignity, the former are devoid of that moral dimension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, § 22, 19 July 2011). This difference is even more salient when it is a public authority that invokes its right to reputation. In view of that, a mere institutional interest of the Moscow City Council in protecting its “reputation” does not necessarily attract the same level of guarantees as that accorded to “the protection of the reputation ... of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov v. Russia, no. 27447/07, § 29, 8 October 2015).",

                "47. The Court observes at the outset that the applicant made the impugned statements acting in his capacity as the head of a non ‑ governmental organisation. When an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press and may be characterised as a social “watchdog” warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press (see, with further references, Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 166, 8 November 2016). The Court has already noted in paragraph 42 above that the matter on which the applicant commented was clearly of interest to the general public. Accordingly, and taking into account that the applicant ’ s statements appeared in the newspaper ’ s article, the Court considers that the following standards established in its case-law − which an interference with the exercise of press freedom must meet in order to satisfy the necessity requirement of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention − are pertinent in the present case."

                "48. By virtue of the essential function the press fulfils in a democracy (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 90, ECHR 2015). The same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 159). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 49, 29 March 2016). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 126, ECHR 2015). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of “protecting the reputation ... of others”, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no. 17224/11, § 77, 27 June 2017). When analysing an interference with the right to freedom of expression, the Court must, inter alia, determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts))."

It thus sees no reasons to conclude that the newspaper ’ s editorial board or Ms G. did not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v.

They did not take account of: the defendant ’ s position as a newspaper ’ s editorial board and the applicant ’ s position as a representative of an NGO; the presence or absence of good faith on their part; the position of the claimant as a public authority; the aims pursued by the defendant in publishing the article and by the applicant in making the impugned statements; whether the impugned article had addressed a matter of public interest or general concern; or the relevance of information regarding the quality of the restoration works at the Tsaritsyno museum complex in the context of preservation of cultural heritage (see, mutatis mutandis, Kunitsyna, no. 9406/05, § 46, 13 December 2016, and Skudayeva, cited above, § 36).

The District Court found that the impugned statements were statements of fact without elaborating on the reasons for doing so; the City Court upheld this finding in a summary fashion. The domestic courts disregarded the requirements of section 9 of Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court, under which value judgments are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 above). The Court would in any event observe that the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments is of less significance in a case such as the present, where the impugned statement is made in the course of the debate on a matter of public interest and where representatives of civil society and journalists should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise the actions of a public authority, even where the statements made may lack a clear basis in fact (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 60)."

            [
                "53. As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, Şener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 54 ). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper ’ s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant ’ s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 44, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, § 42). The District Court ’ s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, § 38)."

Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perinçek, cited above, § 198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts ’ failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention” or to have “based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, § 24).

The Court notes that the applicant denied any knowledge of the pictures and symbols and illegal publications and books found in his office and that the question therefore arises whether there was at all an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression. In that respect, it observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for the offence of praising and condoning acts punishable by law under Article 312 § 1 of the former Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of expression, as noted above, and that he was sanctioned for engaging in such activities, despite his denial of any knowledge of the materials. The Court considers that in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. It should be borne in mind in this respect that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v.

Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, § 57, Series A no. 204). In this respect, the wearing or displaying of symbols has also been held to fall within the spectrum of forms of “expression” within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. The Court held that the display of a symbol associated with a political movement or entity, like that of a flag, was capable of expressing identification with ideas or representing them and fell within the ambit of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 36, 24 July 2012)."

The Court notes that the applicant denied any knowledge of the pictures and symbols and illegal publications and books found in his office and that the question therefore arises whether there was at all an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression. In that respect, it observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for the offence of praising and condoning acts punishable by law under Article 312 § 1 of the former Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of expression, as noted above, and that he was sanctioned for engaging in such activities, despite his denial of any knowledge of the materials. The Court considers that in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. It should be borne in mind in this respect that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; see also, in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013).

The Court notes that the applicant was prosecuted and convicted merely for keeping the aforementioned material in the party ’ s office, which was interpreted by the courts as an indication of respect and approval for the illegal organisation and its leader. The Court, however, considers that the applicant ’ s conduct could not be construed as support for unlawful acts committed by Mr Öcalan and the PKK or any approval in this regard inasmuch as neither in the domestic court decisions nor in the observations of the Government is there any indication that the material in question advocated violence, armed resistance or an uprising (see Gerger v. Turkey [GC], no. 24919/94, § 50, 8 July 1999, and contrast Halis Doğan v. Turkey, no. 75946/01, §§ 35 ‑ 38, 7 February 2006)."

The Government relied on cases such as Zana v. Turkey (25 November 1997, § 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII); Karataş v.

                "26. The Court reiterates that any question of an alleged interference with an applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression hinges upon the prior establishment of whether the applicant has been directly affected by a measure which renders him a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Altuğ Taner Akçam, cited above, § 65)."

Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06, and 28964/06, § 53, ECHR 2011). Indeed, a review of the Court ’ s case-law shows that Article 10 of the Convention has been held to be applicable not only to the more common forms of expression, such as speeches and written texts, but also to other and less obvious media through which people sometimes choose to convey their opinions, messages, ideas and criticisms (see, in particular, Murat Vural v. Turkey, no. 9540/07, § 44, 21 October 2014, and the examples provided therein in §§ 45-51). Moreover, in certain circumstances, the Convention organs have also considered that the right to freedom of expression by implication also guarantees a “negative right” not to be compelled to express oneself ( see, for example, K v. Austria, no. 16002/90, Commission Report of 13 October 1992, § 45; Strohal v. Austria, no. 20871/92, Commission decision of 7 April 1994; and a contrario, Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, §§ 86 and 94, 3 April 2012 ). Thus, an assessment of whether an impugned form of conduct falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention should not be restrictive, but inclusive (see, Murat Vural, cited above, § 52)."

In the light of its case-law, the Court considers that, in deciding whether a certain act or form of conduct falls within the ambit of Article 10 of the Convention, an assessment must be made of the nature of the act or conduct in question, in particular of its expressive character seen from an objective point of view, as well as of the purpose or the intention of the person performing the act or engaging in the conduct in question (ibid., § 54)."

In the instant case, the Court notes that criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant, the vice-president of a political party and the chairperson of a congress of the party in question, for not preventing some of the delegates from speaking Kurdish, in breach of section 81 (c) of Law no. 2820. The applicant acted in this way despite warnings from a government superintendent, which, from an objective point of view, may be seen as an expressive act of defiance towards an authority representing the State. Furthermore, the Court notes that in the course of the criminal proceedings against him the applicant made it very clear that he had not used his power as chairperson to intervene when certain delegates spoke in Kurdish because of his view that Kurdish should be used in all areas of life; that those who spoke Kurdish were speaking in their mother tongue; and that he believed that it was neither legal nor ethical for him to intervene and to force people to speak in a language other than their mother tongue. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that through his particular conduct the applicant exercised his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention (see, in the context of Article 11 read in the light of Article 10, Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 41, Series A no. 202). That provision is thus applicable in the present case."

The criminal proceedings against the applicant were subsequently terminated on the ground that the statutory time-limit prescribed under domestic law had expired and the conviction therefore no longer stood. However, the applicant, an active politician, continued to face the threat of a criminal sanction, entailing a prison sentence, for nearly seven years during the course of the criminal proceedings. Moreover, during the same lengthy period, he was also left in incertitude as to whether or not he ran the risk of new set of criminal proceedings being instituted against him for similar offences, that is not preventing the use of the Kurdish language in the contexts of meetings of a political party, if he was elected to act as a chairman in political party meetings. In view of the above, the Court considers that the application of the prohibition contained in section 81 (c) of Law no. 2820 at the material time amounted to interference with the right to freedom of expression of such a nature that it directly affected the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak, cited above, § 49)."

The Court reiterates that the expression “prescribed by law”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, requires firstly that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law; however, it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences, and that it should be compatible with the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09, § 114, 14 September 2010)."

                "34. One of the requirements flowing from the expression “prescribed by law” is foreseeability. Thus, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable citizens to regulate their conduct; they must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 141, ECHR 2012, and Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 121, ECHR 2015 ). Such consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 131, 15 October 2015) .Whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV)."

It further held that “they cannot remain indifferent to such actions and acts when committed by others”.

Accordingly, it considers that the wording of section 81 of Law no. 2820 was not clear enough to have enabled the applicant to foresee that he would face criminal proceedings, pursuant to section 117 of Law no. 2820, owing to his failure to intervene when certain delegates gave speeches in Kurdish when he was acting as the chairman of the general congress of his political party."

                "At the present time people belonging to the feminist movement fight for equality of the sexes in political, family and sexual relations. Belonging to the feminist movement is not unlawful and is not a criminal offence in the Russian Federation. A number of religions, such as the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and Islam, have a religious, dogmatic basis incompatible with the ideas of feminism. And while feminism is not a religious theory, its adherents interfere with various areas of social relations such as morality, rules of decency, family relations, sexual relations, including those of a non- traditional nature, which were historically constructed on the basis of religious views.",
                "In the modern world, relations between nations and nationalities and between different religions must be built on the principles of mutual respect and equality.

Members of the group make brusque movements with their heads, arms and legs, accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature. That behaviour does not respect the canons of the Orthodox Church, irrespective of whether it takes place in a cathedral or outside its walls. Representatives of other religions and people who do not consider themselves believers also find such behaviour unacceptable. Pussy Riot ’ s ‘ performances ’ outside religious buildings, although containing signs of clear disrespect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred of a specific social group, are not associated with a specific object and therefore amount to a violation of moral standards or an offence. However, placing such a performance within an Orthodox cathedral changes the object of the crime. It represents in that case a mixture of relations between people, rules of conduct established by legal acts, morality, customs, traditions which guarantee a socially tranquil environment and the protection of individuals in various spheres of their lives, as well as the proper functioning of the State and public institutions. Violating the internal regulations of Christ the Saviour Cathedral was merely a way of showing disrespect for society, motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group.",

At the same time, a restriction on freedom of thought and religion and on freedom of expression should not be taken solely on the grounds that the activity or information in question did not comply with traditional views and opinions or contradict moral and/or religious preferences.

                "“ 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the “basic notions” of “extremism” (“extremist activity/extremism”, “extremist organisation ’ and “extremist materials”) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute “extremist activity” or “extremism”. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of “extremist” activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of “extremism” provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of “ terrorism ” and “separatism”, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as “ extremist ” in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below).",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be “associated with violence or calls to violence”. However the current definition (“stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe anti extremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify “stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord” as “extremist activity”, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of “extremism” in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "41. Extremist activity under point 5 brings together a collection of criteria, the combination of which may or may not be required before establishing that the Law applies to them. Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms “in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",
                "42. Similarly, under point 10 incitement to extremist activity is in itself an extremist activity. This provision is problematic to the extent that certain of the activities listed, as pointed out above, should not fall into the category of extremist activities at all.",
                "47. [Article 1.3] defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of “extremist documents” (Article1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti-extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully.",
                "56. The Commission further notes that the Law does not provide for any procedure for the person to whom a warning is addressed to challenge the evidence of the Prosecutor-General upon which it is based at the point when the warning is given, though it is noted that article 6 of the Law provides that the warning may be appealed to a court. It also notes that, according to the law “On the public prosecutor ’ s service in the Russian Federation”, a warning about the unacceptability of breaking the law may be appealed against not only in court but also to a superior public prosecutor.",
                "61. ... [I]n the Commission ’ s view the Law should be made more specific as to the procedures available in order to guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to appeal both the warning/the notice issued, and the liquidation or suspension decision before an independent and impartial tribunal, as enshrined in Article 6 ECHR.",
                "63. ... It is worrying at the same time that, as a result of the vagueness of the Law and of the wide margin of interpretation left to the enforcement authorities, undue pressure is exerted on civil society organisations, media outlets and individuals, which undoubtedly has a negative impact on the free and effective exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
                "65. ... It is therefore essential, in order for the warnings and notices or any other anti-extremism measures to fully comply with the requirements of Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR, to ensure that any restrictions that they may introduce to fundamental rights stem from a pressing social need, are proportionate within the meaning of the ECHR and are clearly defined by law. The relevant provisions of the Extremism Law should thus be amended accordingly.",
                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, “while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law”.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the “basic notions” defined by the Law - such as the definition of “extremism”, “extremist actions”, “extremist organisations” or “extremist materials” – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways. The assurances of the authorities that the negative effects would be avoided thanks to the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the interpretation of the Russian Institute for Legislation and Comparative Law or good faith are not sufficient to satisfy the relevant international requirements.",
                "76. The specific instruments that the Law provides for in order to counter extremism – the written warnings and notices - and the related punitive measures (liquidation and/or ban on the activities of public religious or other organisations, closure of media outlets) raise problems in the light of the freedom of association and the freedom of expression as protected by the [European Convention on Human Rights] and need to be adequately amended.",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.”",

At the global level, there is not sufficient common ground to provide for a margin of appreciation.

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

They further submitted that metal cages or their replacement, glass docks, had been in use in courts as a security measure for over twenty years and that anyone in pre-trial detention was routinely placed there.

Furthermore, glass docks in particular were in use in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Ukraine and in some courts in the United Kingdom and Canada. They noted that the Court had found in a number of judgments that the use of metal cages in courtrooms was incompatible with Article 3 (see, among others, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no. 1704/06, §§ 96-102, 27 January 2009; Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, no. 34334/04, § § 123-29, 15 June 2010; and Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, ECHR 2014 (extracts) ), however, they were unaware of similar findings with respect to glass docks. In the Government ’ s view, a glass dock, unlike handcuffs or other security measures, allowed the accused to choose a comfortable position or to move around inside the dock while feeling safe from possible attack by victims, which was particularly relevant in the applicants ’ case as many members of the public inside the courtroom had had a hostile and aggressive stance towards them. Furthermore, in contrast to Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, ( cited above, § 100), the glass dock did not in the least either “ humiliate the applicants in their own eyes” or “arouse in them feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority ”, which was corroborated by the fact that not only did the applicants not shy away from the public, but directly addressed them during the proceedings. Likewise, in contrast with Ashot Harutyunyan, ( cited above, § 128), there was no evidence that the glass dock had had any “impact on [their] powers of concentration and mental alertness ” either.

They submitted, in particular, that the glass dock had been very small, which had significantly limited their movements inside it. Furthermore, the glass dock conveyed a message to an outside observer that individuals placed in it had to be locked up and were therefore dangerous criminals. That message had not only been reinforced by the small size of the dock and its position in the courtroom, but also by the high level of security and the guard dogs around it. The applicants contested the Government ’ s submission that that had been necessary for their own safety. They argued that there had been no attempts to disrupt the trial and that the presence of such a high number of armed police officers, ushers and guard dogs had only served the purpose of intimidating them and their counsel, to debase them and, given that the trial had been closely followed by the media, to create a negative image of them as dangerous criminals in the eyes of the wide media audience which had followed the trial."

The third applicant also submitted that despite being held in the glass dock, she had also been handcuffed for three hours during the reading out of the judgment.

At the same time, the courts had agreed with the prosecuting authorities that if they had not been remanded in custody the applicants could have absconded from the trial, obstructed the proceedings or continued their criminal activity.

In the ADF ’ s view, the Court should look at the context of events rather than the particular content of the speech when determining whether such a restriction had been proportionate. In that regard, the ADF referred to several cases where the Court had found a restriction on the manner and form of expression to be proportionate as long as the expression itself had not been prohibited from taking place ( they referred, inter alia, to Rai, Allmond and \"Negotiate Now” v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 25522/94, 6 April 1995, and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, 5 March 2009, both cases examined under Article 11).

It had therefore to be clearly defined what constituted the offence of incitement to religious discrimination, hostility and violence."

The interveners further observed that laws restricting freedom of expression in the interests of protecting religions or their adherents from offences such as blasphemy, religious insult and defamation were often vague, subject to abuse and punished expression that fell short of the threshold of advocacy of hatred and were therefore detrimental to other human rights. In that regard the interveners referred, in particular, to the Report of the Venice Commission, the Human Rights Committee ’ s General Comment no. 34 and the Rabat Plan of Action (see paragraphs 101, 107 and 110 above)."

ARTICLE 19 noted that the provision did not specify that it only applied to calls for territorial changes by means of violent action. Secondly, it cited Federal Law no. 135-FZ of 29 June 2013 on an Amendment to Article 148 of the Criminal Code and Other Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation with the Aim to Counter Insults to the Religious Convictions and Feelings of Citizens, which had criminalised insulting religious feelings. Thirdly, it noted that libel, which had been decriminalised in 2011, had again been made a criminal offence by Federal Law no. 141-FZ of 28 July 2012 on Amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation. ARTICLE 19 referred to a number of convictions for libel under Article 128.1 where the statements at issue had been directed against State officials. Fourthly, it referred to Federal Law no. 190-FZ of 12 November 2012 on Amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and Article 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. It had broadened the definition of the crime of “high treason” contained in Article 275 of the Criminal Code by including “assistance ... to a foreign State, an international or foreign organisation or their representatives in activity directed against the security of the Russian Federation”. The definition of “espionage” contained in Article 276 of the Criminal Code had also been broadened to add international organisations to the list of entities cooperation with which could be considered as espionage."

Firstly, it cited Federal Law no. 121-FZ of 20 July 2012 on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in the Part Related to the Regulation of the Activity of Non-Commercial Organisations Acting as Foreign Agents, which required non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that received foreign funding and engaged in political activity to register as “foreign agents”. Secondly, it referred to Federal Law no. 272-FZ of 28 December 2012 on Measures in respect of Persons Involved in a Breach of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, Rights and the Freedoms of Nationals of the Russian Federation. Apart from imposing sanctions on a number of United States officials on account of violations of the human rights of Russian citizens and banning the adoption of Russian children by US nationals, the law had also banned Russian NGOs that either engaged in political activity and received funding from the United States or engaged in activities that threatened Russia ’ s interests. Thirdly, it mentioned Federal law no. 65-FZ of 8 June 2010 on Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation and the Federal Law on Assemblies, Meetings, Demonstrations, Marches and Picketing, which had introduced numerous restrictions on the right of assembly. In particular, entire categories of people had been forbidden to organise public events on account of having a criminal record or of having committed administrative offences; the law provided for broad liability for an organiser for possible damage caused during an event; maximum penalties for a breach of the law in question had been increased and a new administrative offence of organising the simultaneous presence and/or movement of citizens in public places which entailed a breach of public order had been introduced in Article 20.2.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences."

Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society.

Her attempt proved to be unsuccessful.

Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. In any event, Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it would be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012)."

Secondly, the Court will address the Government ’ s objections to the admissibility of the complaint by the first and second applicants who had not filed any appeals of their own."

                "246. On the issue whether the substantive appeal offered sufficient prospects of success so as not to be obviously futile, the Court notes that the prosecutor ’ s application for a banning order was considered in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. Articles 42 and 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure established, in principle, the right of persons whose interests were affected by the proceedings to join them as interested parties. In raising the non-exhaustion objection against the first and second applicants, the Government cited the example of similar proceedings conducted under the Suppression of Extremism Act in which a Moscow court had accepted a substantive appeal from the author of the book which had been subject to a banning order (see paragraph 232 above). In the same vein, a court in the Krasnodar Region allowed a substantive appeal against the banning order submitted by two followers of a Chinese spiritual movement who had not been informed of the proceedings in which the foundational book of the movement had been pronounced extremist (see Sinitsyn and Others v. Russia, nos. 39879/12 and 5956/13, communicated on 30 August 2017 ). Likewise, the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court allowed a substantive appeal by the Krasondar Muftiate against the order banning the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” as extremist (see Yedinoe Dukhovnoye Upravleniye Musulman Krasnoyarskogo Kraya v. Russia, no. 28621/11, communicated on 27 November 2013). The stance adopted by the Moscow City Court also appeared to indicate that the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal would be considered on the merits (see paragraph 79 above). In light of these elements, the Court finds that the third applicant could reasonably and legitimately expect that the court would seriously examine her arguments in favour of setting aside the banning order. Neither she nor her counsel could have expected that on the same day the same City Court would reject her substantive appeal for a lack of locus standi (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, where the third applicant made use of an existing remedy which was prima facie accessible and available but turned out to be ineffective, the six-month period would have started, in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law cited above, on the date of the Moscow City Court ’ s judgment rejecting her substantive appeal."

Since she was not the one who brought this complaint to the Court, the first and second applicants should have either complained within the six months of the banning order or made use of the same remedy independently of her. The Court has recognised that Article 35 § 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, taking realistic account of, in particular, the applicant ’ s personal circumstances (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 116, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). As noted above, the third applicant was the only one who was given a suspended sentence and retained her freedom. Unrestricted in her contacts with the outside world and her legal team, she took it upon herself to challenge the banning order in the proceedings which appeared to offer a prospect of success, at least in the initial stage. All three applicants being members of the same band whose recorded performances had been declared extremist, they were in the same situation in relation to the challenge to the banning order she had mounted. The Court sees no reason to assume that the proceedings would have taken any different course had they filed separate appeals against the banning order. It considers that the first and second applicant were not required to attempt the same remedy after the ineffectiveness of a substantive appeal had become apparent with the Moscow City Court ’ s decision of 30 January 2013 (compare Bagdonavicius and Others v. Russia, no. 19841/06, § 62, 11 October 2016). The purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them and the proceedings instituted by the third applicant had provided the Russian authorities with ample opportunity to remedy the violation alleged (see Oliari and Others v. Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, § 77, 21 July 2015). The fact that the third applicant chose not to pursue her application to the Court under this head is immaterial after the matter had already been dealt with at domestic level (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, § 69, 25 April 2013, and Bilbija and Blažević v. Croatia, no. 62870/13, § 94, 12 January 2016, in both cases it was not the applicant, but a member of their family who was not an applicant before the Court who had already pursued the same remedy without success, and also D.H. and Others, cited above, § 122, in which only five out of twelve applicants had lodged a constitutional complaint concerning the same grievance )."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

The Venice Commission also deplored the absence of “violence” as a qualifying element of “extremism” or “extremist activity” (see §§ 31, 35 and 36 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 102 above).

                "261. The Court notes that in its decision of 29 November 2012 to declare the video material in question as “extremist”, the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court referred to four types of such actions listed in section 1 ( 1 ) of the Suppression of Extremism Act : (1) “ the stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”; (2) “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”; (3) “violations of human and civil rights and freedoms and lawful interests in connection with a person ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”; and (4) “public appeals to carry out the above-mentioned acts or the mass dissemination of knowingly extremist materials, and likewise the production or storage thereof with the aim of mass dissemination” (see paragraph 76 above). It subsequently relied on the results of report no. 55/13 of 26 March 2012 of the psychological linguistic expert examination performed by experts from the Federal Scientific Research University ‘ The Russian Institute for Cultural Research ’, according to which the video materials in question were of an extremist nature (see paragraph 76 above). In the Court ’ s view, the domestic court ’ s decision in the applicants ’ case was deficient for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "262. In the first place, it is evident from the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court ’ s decision that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings at to the extremist nature of the video material but linguistic experts. The court failed to assess the expert report and merely endorsed the linguistic experts ’ conclusions. The relevant expert examination clearly went far beyond resolving merely language issues, such as, for instance, defining the meaning of particular words and expressions, and provided, in essence, a legal qualification of the video materials. The Court finds that situation unacceptable and stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 113, 3 October 2017)."
            ],
            [
                "263. Secondly, the domestic court made no attempt to conduct its own analysis of the video materials in question. It did not specify which particular elements of the videos were problematic so as to bring them within the scope of the provisions of section 1 ( 1 ) of the Suppression of Extremism Act it referred to in the decision (see Kommersant Moldovy v. Moldova, no. 41827/02, § 36, 9 January 2007, and Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, § 22, 26 January 2017). Moreover, the court did not so much as quote the relevant parts of the expert report, referring only briefly to its overall findings. The virtual absence of reasoning by the domestic court makes it impossible for the Court to grasp the rationale behind the interference."
            ],
            [
                "264. In the light of the lack of reasons given by the domestic court, the Court is not satisfied that it “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 ” or based itself “ on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see Jersild, cited above, § 31, and Kommersant Moldovy, cited above, § 38 ). The domestic court consequently failed to provide “relevant and sufficient” reasons for the interference in question."
            ],
            [
                "265. Furthermore, the Court takes note of the first and second applicants ’ argument that the proceedings in the case at hand were flawed as they could not participate in them. In fact, the applicants were unable to contest the findings of the expert report relied upon by the domestic court as none of them were able to participate in the proceedings. Not only were they not even informed of the proceedings in question, but the application to join the proceedings lodged by the third applicant was dismissed at three levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 74, 78 and 79 above). Furthermore, it was precisely on the grounds that she was not a party to the proceedings that her appeal against the decision of 29 November 2012 was left without examination ( see paragraph 80 above )."

                "266. The Court observes that it was not a particular shortcoming in their case which meant that the applicants were unable to participate in the proceedings, but because of the state of the domestic law, which does not provide for concerned parties to participate in proceedings under the Suppression of Extremism Act. The Court notes that it has found a breach of Article 10 of the Convention in a number of cases in situations where under the domestic law an applicant was unable effectively to contest criminal charges brought against him, as he was either not allowed to adduce evidence of the truth of his statements, or to plead a defence of justification, or due to the special protection afforded to the party having the status of the victim in the criminal proceedings (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236; Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 66, ECHR 2002 ‑ V; Pakdemirli v. Turkey, no. 35839/97, § 52, 22 February 2005; and Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, § 55, ECHR 2011). It further notes that it has likewise found a violation of Article 10 on account of a breach of equality of arms in civil defamation proceedings (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005 - II)."

            [
                "267. The Court considers that similar considerations apply to proceedings instituted under the Suppression of Extremism Act. In the Court ’ s view, a domestic court can never be in a position to provide “relevant and sufficient” reasons for an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention without some form of judicial review based on a weighing up of the arguments put forward by the public authority against those of the interested party. Therefore, the proceedings instituted in order to recognise the first and second applicants ’ activity or materials belonging to them as “extremist”, in which the domestic law did not allow their participation, thereby depriving them of any possibility to contest the allegations made by the public authority that brought the proceedings before the courts, cannot be found compatible with Article 10 of the Convention."

As noted in the travaux préparatoires (HE no. 84/1997 vp ... ) this is relevant chiefly in domains where decision-making takes place or in which the circumstances in reality may affect the every-day life of several persons or which have relevance of principle. According to the travaux préparatoires, such domains are first and foremost the attendance to a public office or function, business life and political activity.

The acts mentioned in the charge related to [X ’ s] actions as an entrepreneur in a relatively small cleaning firm. Although the criminal case concerned substantial financial benefits, it was not a case which, viewed on its own, was of such general public interest that there would have been grounds to reproduce, as part of an article and without [X ’ s] consent, another article that included her name and photograph. Although the underlying purpose of the article might have been to draw attention to the abuse of social benefits in general by using an individual case and thus to a negative social phenomenon, it was not necessary or justified to publish without authorisation an illustration revealing the identity of an individual private person charged with or convicted of such an offence and in a similar position to [X].",

Thus, it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence. The fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure, before publishing the information again, that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it. The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff ’ s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant ’ s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant ’ s name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant ’ s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult. By again reporting on the matter two months after the events had occurred, the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid."

The gravity of the crime is also an obvious relevant factor. The central question is who is a public figure. There have been cases where spouses, girlfriends or boyfriends of public figures have argued that they were not, and won their case in court. Recently following a school massacre the Minister of the Interior disclosed the name of the killer in a live televised press conference, a few hours after the incident.

A public debate had taken place, in which those judgments had been criticised. Furthermore, in December 2005 the Supreme Court had decided a case ( no. 2005:136; see paragraph 31 above ) which concerned another article published in the Alibi magazine. In that case, the majority of the Supreme Court judges had taken the view that the magazine had been entitled to publish the name of a convicted criminal. The incompatibility of that Supreme Court judgment with its judgment in the present case was, in itself, sufficient reason to find a violation. The applicants also observed that it was difficult for the Finnish media to report on legal proceedings because the domestic courts ’ decisions had made it difficult to predict when disclosure of the identity of a defendant or convicted person was within the sphere of freedom of expression and the public nature of legal proceedings and when, in contrast, disclosure constituted a criminal offence giving rise to a liability to pay damages. In the present case the Supreme Court had not even mentioned the Convention or Article 10 thereof. The names of accused and convicted persons were published daily in the Finnish media. There were no legal provisions defining when a defendant ’ s identity could be revealed.

The District Court had held at least nine hearings before the impugned article was published. The applicants were surprised that neither the Government nor the Supreme Court had mentioned the principle of the public nature of legal proceedings, given that the case related exclusively to the disclosure of the identity of a defendant in such proceedings. Finnish legislation contained no provision which required the accused person ’ s consent prior to publication of his or her name or picture. At the relevant time the Constitution Act had not included a separate provision on the protection of privacy. The defendant ’ s identity in a trial had never before been considered as belonging to a person ’ s private life within the meaning of Chapter 27, Article 3a, of the Penal Code, and this principle still applied to public legal proceedings. For example, in its decision no. 2005:136 the Supreme Court majority had reached the opposite conclusion with regard to the publication of a convicted person ’ s name, ruling that “a criminal offence is not the private matter of the individual who committed the offence”. In the applicants ’ view, the Government defined the concept of private life too broadly when they claimed that information was part of private life unless specifically found otherwise. This claim contradicted the provisions of the Public Nature of Court Proceedings Act."

                "45. The provision on invasion of privacy required that, in order to constitute a criminal offence, the publication of the information had to be unlawful and intentional and had to relate to a person ’ s private life. The impugned article met none of these criteria. Firstly, the publication of public information, namely a person ’ s identity, was a legal right. Secondly, being accused of an offence in legal proceedings was not part of a person ’ s private life. Thirdly, the requirement of intent in criminal law was not met when a reporter had no idea that the disclosure of a defendant ’ s identity could constitute a criminal offence. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the present case was probably the first in Finnish history in which the opposite view had been upheld. The appellate court had found, in accordance with legal precedent until the present case, that reporting on charges which were the subject of public legal proceedings was legitimate, even though the information published could cause anguish to the defendant. The Guidelines for Journalists did not meet the “prescribed by law” requirement since they could not be applied when deciding whether an act constituted a criminal offence. The applicants did not deny the ethical demands placed upon the profession by the Guidelines. They observed that, despite their legal rights, they had sought to protect X ’ s identity in the article by crossing out her surname and her picture, but because of a printer ’ s error, her face and surname had been shown."

There was no pressing social need to depart from the established practice and regulations. In a democratic State, legal proceedings were public and a defendant ’ s identity was public information; this also served to ensure the legal protection of defendants. The question of whether the disclosure of X ’ s identity had been necessary for the purpose of dealing with a socially important matter was irrelevant, since the provisions on the public nature of legal proceedings were not associated with matters of social significance. In any event, the proceedings against X had significance for society. Offences of tax and accounting fraud did not belong to private life, and fraud concerning a disability pension amounting to almost FIM 2.5 million was a major offence. X had ultimately received a heavy sentence. The criminal charges against X had been significant enough to justify the publication of her name."

                "58. As to whether the interference was “ prescribed by law ”, the applicants argued that the names of accused persons were published daily in the Finnish media and that they had not therefore been able to foresee that the publication of X ’ s name and photograph would render them liable in damages. The Government argued that the publication of names had never been usual in Finland in news reports on offences and that it had not been considered consistent with good journalistic practice to publish names of suspects or accused persons. The Court does not discern any ambiguity as to the contents of the relevant provision of the Penal Code (the spreading of information, an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as invasion of privacy; see paragraph 22 above ). Nor was Chapter 5, section 6, of the Tort Liability Act unclear (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard also to the domestic case-law on the subject, the possibility that a sanction would be imposed was not unforeseeable. The position taken in the Supreme Court ’ s subsequent decision of 2005 does not detract from this position as the circumstances of that case concerning the conviction of a person of violent crime degrading the victim ’ s human dignity (see paragraph 3 1 above) were significantly different. The Court therefore concludes that the interference was thus “prescribed by law” (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 34, 16 November 2004 and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ X).

The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 62, Series A no. 30 ). In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ III )."

                "60. Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v.

In the cases in which the Court has had to balance the protection of private life against freedom of expression, it has stressed the contribution made by photos or articles in the press to a debate of general interest (see Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, §§ 59 et seq., ECHR 2001 ‑ I; News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, cited above, §§ 52 et seq.; and Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 34315/96, §§ 33 et seq., 26 February 2002). The Court thus found, in one case, that the use of certain terms in relation to an individual ’ s private life was not “ justified by considerations of public concern ” and that those terms did not “[bear] on a matter of general importance” (see Tammer, cited above, § 68) and went on to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 10. In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of “major public concern” and that the published photographs “did not disclose any details of [the] private life” of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 37) and held that there had been a violation of Article 10. Similarly, in a case concerning the publication by President Mitterrand ’ s former private doctor of a book containing revelations about the President ’ s state of health, the Court held that “the more time that elapsed, the more the public interest in discussion of the history of President Mitterrand ’ s two terms of office prevailed over the requirements of protecting the President ’ s rights with regard to medical confidentiality” (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004-IV) and held that there had been a breach of Article 10."

While reporting and commenting on court proceedings, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public, it is to be noted that the public nature of court proceedings does not function as a carte blanche relieving the media of their duty to show due care in communicating information received in the course of those proceedings (see Council of Europe Recommendation No. Rec (2003)13 on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings; paragraphs 34 and 35 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Finnish Guidelines for Journalists, as in force at the relevant time, stated that the publication of a name and other identifying information in this context was justified only if a significant public interest was involved (see paragraph 32 above)."

The pictures of X were accompanied by a question (see paragraph 8 above) : “ It seemed legal, but ... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks? ” Reading the 1997 article as a whole, the Court cannot find that this statement was excessive or misleading as it was clearly phrased as a question. Furthermore, it is of importance that the depicted events and quotations in the article were taken from the public prosecutor ’ s bill of indictment, which had become a public document the moment it was received by the District Court. In this case it is not in dispute that the reporting on the criminal case was based on facts. The article stated that charges had been brought against X and that the case was pending before the District Court."

The situation described in the earlier article did not come within the sphere of any public debate. That being said, in the earlier article the applicant had willingly shared with the readers her personal experiences and had consented in this connection to having her photograph published. The 1997 article must be considered to have reproduced an article which was irrelevant to the subject under discussion, giving X ’ s name and picture, which were thereby expressly communicated to the general public. It is however not for this Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists ( see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298 ). For the sake of clarity, it is not the initial publication of that article which is before the Court but its use as an illustration in the 1997 article."

                "66. The Court can accept that the purpose of the 1997 article was to contribute to a public discussion. The criminal case brought against X was selected as an example illustrating the problems involved. While it is perfectly legitimate to use individual cases to highlight a more general problem, the question is whether the applicants went too far when they communicated X ’ s identity to the public. It is plain that X was not a public figure or a politician but an ordinary person who was the subject of criminal proceedings (see Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, § 32, Series A no. 242 ‑ B ). The fact that she ran a relatively small cleaning firm and had given an interview eight years previously to a magazine, which had come about in circumstances apparently not discussed during the domestic proceedings or at any length before the Court, does not mean that she had knowingly entered the public arena (see, mutatis mutandis, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 75, Series A no. 294 ‑ B ). X ’ s status as an ordinary person enlarges the zone of interaction which may fall within the scope of private life. The fact that she was the subject of criminal proceedings cannot remove from her the protection of Article 8 (see Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, § 28-29, ECHR 2005 ‑ I )."

The court held that once the preliminary investigation was completed it was for the trial court to consider whether there were substantial indications of guilt and whether in particular there was still a danger that the applicant would abscond. In this respect the court noted that since 5 May 1994 it had been impossible to find the applicant in Italy and that in the various proceedings brought against him a number of coercive measures had been ordered that could not be enforced. Moreover, in judgments of 29 July 1994 and 7 December 1994 the applicant had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In the District Court's view, the applicant's lengthy stay abroad demonstrated his determination to evade the coercive measures ordered against him in 1994."

At the hearing on 29 September 1995 in the case of Metropolitana Milanese, the Public Prosecutor in charge of the applicant's case, Mr Paolo Ielo, filed the transcripts of the telephone interceptions with the registry and asked that they be admitted as evidence against the applicant. The prosecution argued that they were necessary to assess the applicant's personality in order to determine the sentence if he were convicted, and that they could support the prosecution's allegation that the applicant intended to continue to abscond. The prosecution subsequently read out in court certain extracts of interceptions with a view to proving: a) that the applicant could leave Hammamet; b) that the applicant had started or influenced two virulent press campaigns against a magistrate of the Milan District Court and against an Italian political party; c) that the applicant was collecting information concerning certain politicians and magistrates, with a view to damaging their reputation; d) that the applicant continued to show aggressiveness towards the magistrates who were investigating him. The Public Prosecutor compared the applicant's conduct to that of a “certified criminal” ( criminale matricolato ) who attacked all those who had done their job and had tried to do it well. The Public Prosecutor declared that the transcripts of the telephone conversations were at the disposal of the District Court and of the defendants."
            ],
            [
                "24. The transcript of the speech given by Mr Ielo at the hearing of 29 September 1995 reads as follows:",
                "“I am submitting these further pleas under Article 507. I have already explained why I intend to submit these documents, which consist, firstly, of assessments of Craxi's criminal potential, within the meaning of Article 133, with reference in particular to his conduct after the offence was committed, and, secondly, of assessments as to whether the measure affecting his personal freedom should be maintained for the reasons for which it was decided on, and whether it should be extended for other reasons. I shall try to be extremely brief, although what I have to say will take a little time. I have tried to divide the documents submitted according to subject-matter, and have put together the telephone transcripts - the documents include the measures authorising the telephone tapping and the confiscation orders, which were moreover confirmed by the tribunale della libertà [the court responsible for deciding on the justification for measures restricting personal freedom or property rights]. The first set consists of telephone transcripts and clearly shows that Craxi can move about in Hammamet. This seems self-evident, yet Craxi is someone who, during the proceedings - all the proceedings taking place in Milan - said he had a legitimate reason for not attending and sent doctors' certificates. First he complained that the trials were not taking place, and now that the trials are taking place he wants them postponed on the grounds that he has a legitimate reason for being unable to attend. It is absolutely clear from these telephone transcripts that Craxi is someone who is able to move from the address of the subscription to the telephone line on which he receives calls. Why is this important? The reason is clear: Craxi is such a liar that he continues to lie even before the courts, saying things that are untrue and belied by documentary evidence.",
                "The second point concerns Craxi as a danger to the community, in particular his capacity to operate in the current situation, and become involved in the processes whereby public opinion is shaped and in other processes, which I shall discuss. In my opinion, two operations are particularly important - two press campaigns which were co-ordinated ... or at any rate two press campaigns in which Craxi clearly played an important role. The first is a recent one: I am referring to the telephone calls on 14 September 1995 - I apologise for the vulgarity, but I am reporting the speech of others and am not responsible.",
                "Subscriber Craxi, talking to Luca Iosi, says, 'the son of the hero' - the reference to Di Pietro is clear. An incomprehensible sentence 'He contributes to the tune of 2,400,000 a year, no less, when it all comes out.' Luca Iosi says, 'Now we take the wraps off the case and then we shoot him in the balls.' A week later the front page news is: 'Di Pietro too, has a house in the centre for 240,000.'",
                "The second press campaign was co-ordinated directly from Hammamet. It is the press campaign that was waged in Italia Settimanale, whose editor is Alessandro Caprettini. What happened? In a nutshell, Craxi sent Alessandro Caprettini a file on the [Northern] League, concerning alleged arms dealings by the League, and Alessandro Caprettini willingly received and published it. What is particularly important is that, in my opinion, the file came from Craxi himself: it was found on Craxi's computer or, rather, on the computer in Craxi's office in via Boezio in Rome and, in particular, was referred to in the conversation between Caprettini and Craxi, in two respects. Firstly, the subscriber - when I say subscriber, I mean Craxi - says, word for word, 'In any case we can do more with them - we can investigate but we can also raise questions.' What he means is that they can be used to raise questions about the Northern League, an Italian political party receiving special attention from a fugitive from justice, who agrees with the editor of a weekly to launch a campaign of this type. The second important thing is: 'Of course I publish the article, and then I go to a prosecutor who is a friend of mine and say, “Hey, look into this affair, will you?” - but this is the sort of thing one does nothing about'. Further evidence that Craxi is a liar comes from an article in the Indipendente, which published the news that Craxi had denied being the author of the material sent to Italia Settimanale. I am producing this evidence to make it clear that when we talk of Craxi it is not like shooting at the Red Cross: we are talking of someone who is fully active and has a great capacity to influence the media. In this connection, there is a set of telephone transcripts which show that Craxi was in constant contact with journalists in a wide variety of areas.",
                "Let us now move on to the last three points which, I believe, deserve a minimum of attention.",
                "There is documentary proof, and proof from the telephone transcripts, that Craxi is mounting dossiers in Hammamet against some political activists. I am referring - with particular regard to the evidence that has been found - to dossiers against D'Alema. He is engaging in “dossierism” ...",
                "The President: What does the neologism mean? Compiling information or a dossier?",
                "The Public Prosecutor: Compiling information in order to attack someone's reputation. This is an activity that was also to be pursued against judges, including myself, but we shall discuss that later.",
                "I said “dossierism”, which consists in compiling information that can damage people's reputation. This is documented by the telephone transcripts. One alarming aspect, in my view, is that it provides further evidence of Bettino Craxi's criminal potential.",
                "I am talking about compiling dossiers of information designed to damage the reputation of certain eminent people, and I am thinking of D'Alema, Prodi and Del Turco, about whom I shall talk in connection with a specific note that was found in Craxi's office. The dossiers were mounted with a certain Tina Soncini Massari from Bologna, who is an old friend of Craxi's - by friend I mean someone with whom he had relations which were, I imagine, of a political nature - to the extent that Tina Soncini Massari appears on a list of presents that Craxi gave. She is a leading supporter of Gelli, and is known to the judicial authorities for having arranged to put the Bologna judicial authorities off the track when they were investigating the massacres, by bribing witnesses. In this connection, I can produce evidence that identifies Tina Soncini Massari: the order from the Bologna investigating judge, Dr Grassi if I am not mistaken, which shows that the most recent contact between Gelli and Tina Soncini Massari dates back to 1993, and which makes it clear that she attempted to put the investigators off track and bribed witnesses in the course of the proceedings. These are the sort of people Bettino Craxi, a fugitive from justice who is the subject of pre-trial detention orders, uses in order to hinder investigations. You will be able to see for yourselves what these documents contain, and I shall not dwell on them. What is significant is another note on Del Turco also found in Craxi's office. I shall read you out the beginning so you can understand what all this is about. The Italian Socialist Party administration has always helped to support the Socialist current of the CGIL [Federation of Italian Trade Unions]. Del Turco took over from Marianetti, and the flow of money never stopped. 'On average, Del Turco received 20 to 30 million a month from Balzamo. On the occasion of every election or conference, there were extraordinary payments for instance, and so it went on', and the note continues with information about the politician.",
                "There are also telephone transcripts of statements by Bitetto in which he appears to be talking about D'Alema ... These are statements that have been filed and can be seen by anyone: it is clear to all why they are important from a criminal point of view.",
                "Then there are documents that show that Bettino Craxi has, or at any rate had, relations with important members of the Italian institutions. I am referring in particular to the telephone transcript of 2 September 1995, during which the subscriber, Craxi, talks to Margherita - she is not identified, who says: 'Alberto told me that he attended a meeting between Arafat and Silvio, and they spent ten minutes talking about you alone. Arafat came to Tunisia to see you and told Silvio Berlusconi to tell you that he too would be happy to have you as his guest in Palestine.' Again in connection with the capacity for communication of the accused, Bettino Craxi, who I repeat is a fugitive from justice and the subject of an arrest warrant for corruption with aggravating circumstances, there is a letter which the State Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister's office sent to Craxi's secretary on 25 June, in which the State Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister's office writes: “Dear Serenella, what you feared has happened, although both Giachieri and Carbonoli promise their good offices and will put things right'.",
                "Basically, this concerns a recommendation addressed to the State Under-Secretary, who hastens to reply, saying ... Serenella is Serenella Carloni. And let it be clear that Serenella Carloni is nobody in her own right, and yet as Bettino Craxi's secretary she was still able, on 22 June 1995, to make recommendations concerning the allocation of service areas in Perugia.",
                "The last point on which I intend to dwell is the constant attacks by Bettino Craxi on those who investigated him. The right to defend oneself is sacred and culminates in a fair trial, but when it is exercised by attacking those involved in the proceedings, those who carried out the investigations, it is, in my view, proof of a very highly developed potential for crime.",
                "A note found in Craxi's office - Craxi's own office - you may, if you wish, in this connection hear Simonetta Carloni, who, I repeat, confirmed this - contained, among other pleasantries, a very precise reference in time in the form of Dell'Utri's release from prison - it is dated after Dell'Utri's release. Among the pleasantries, the note says: 'The Di Pietro case must become an exemplary case: we must get to the bottom of things because all the conditions are right. The usual logic of hitting one person in order to teach a hundred others a lesson. Forza Italia must regain its independence and this means it must not be subjected to the requirements of allies and exposed to dangers and uncertainty. There are key targets, particularly the Milan Pool [a group of Milan public prosecutors waging war on corruption]. We need to have the courage to call for its arrest before they do. We need to denounce the damage caused by the revolt. We must begin by using people as examples and waging war. We need to use parliamentary force in every way possible. This includes calling for enquiries with a lot of publicity and denouncing abuses of authority - by Craxi. There is the seizure of the parliamentary question from Maiolo, faxed by the Forza Italia parliamentary group ... Luca Mantovani, who sent it for information to Bettino Craxi two days later with a covering letter which says: 'I would point out, inter alia, that Maiolo has in the last few hours been collecting more documentation with a view to asking further questions in the near future about the management of the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office.' There are telephone transcripts in which we read: 'We need to bombard them in the press'. There are also attacks connected with what was published in Il Mattino. There is something for everyone - not just for the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office. There are attacks on other colleagues and references to other colleagues. A woman talking to Craxi says, 'He's bewildered too' and says that the person in question was used by the Milan group as a killer; she says she has heard from Biondi that the person coming down to speak is virtually in the service of Caselli. I will spare you all the rest because you can read it for yourself. I shall just read you one extract, partly because it concerns me and partly because it concerns these proceedings. 'So why doesn't someone else come?', with reference to Salamone, who is clearly involved ... he knows the truth of the matter. 'I think Milan stopped him.' 'I am about' - here it is the subscriber, Bettino Craxi, speaking - 'to denounce this Ielo. Both Borelli's statements against Mancuso and the statements by Ielo come under Article 289 [of the Criminal Code]'.",
                "He is speaking to a certain Salvatore, who has not yet been identified, but I hope very soon to identify him, who repeats, 'Yes, but he's dealing with it.' Craxi replies, 'He has nothing to do with this.' The person to whom he is speaking says, 'No, of course not. The minister's dealing with it.'",
                "The President: The public prosecutor is requested to bring the charges without making allusions or taking stands, or making comments of a personal nature.",
                "The public prosecutor: President, the charge is based on the premise that these telephone transcripts show, within the meaning of Article 133, behaviour - and this is where the accused, Bettino Craxi, has committed an offence - worthy of a certified criminal - it is the behaviour of someone who attacks all those who have simply done their job, because that is what they are paid to do and that is what they have chosen to do, and have sought to do it properly, but he doesn't care, he has to attack them and ...",

Mr Ielo pointed out that immediately after the hearing of 29 September 1995, the file containing all the telephone interceptions had been forwarded to Mr Guiso, the applicant's lawyer; the file had been returned to the Public Prosecutor Office only the following Monday, when part of the transcripts had already been released into the public domain.

Mr Guiso confirmed the version given by Mr Ielo. He indicated that he had copied the file which had been forwarded to him, but that this was done in a particularly secret manner, in order to protect the applicant's interests and to avoid any divulging which could be prejudicial for him. Some journalists had requested to be granted access to the transcripts, but Mr Guiso had categorically refused. Mr Giuso underlined that, as prescribed by the law, the file with the transcripts had been made available to all the parties of the trial, and not only to the applicant's defence lawyers.

The District Court first observed that according to Article 271 of the CPP and to the Court of Cassation's case law, failure to respect the formalities indicated in Article 268 §§ 4 and 6 of the CPP did not prevent the use of the interceptions. It moreover noted that according to Article 295 § 3 of the CPP, the said Article 268, which concerned wire-tapings made during the preliminary investigations, could apply to the trial phase only “if possible”. In the present case, the selection of the material had been made in the presence of the parties and in its “natural” place, which was the trial hearing. The District Court however decided not to make use of the information yielded by the telephone interceptions made between 20 July and 3 August 1995, in that they were relevant but not “absolutely necessary” within the meaning of Article 507 of the CCP in order to assess the applicant's personality. The District Court further held that the interceptions made after 3 August 1995 could not be used as evidence, as no application had been made by the prosecutor for an extension of the duration of interception, nor could such authorisation be considered as having been implicitly granted for as long as the applicant would be absconding.",

                "44. The applicant is a professional lawyer and the President of the Moscow Bar. Admittedly, the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts, and such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar. However, as the Court has repeatedly emphasised, lawyers are entitled to freedom of expression too and they have the right to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, §§ 173-174, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII; Amihalachioaie v. Moldova, no. 60115/00, § 27, ECHR 2004 ‑ III; and Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ II, with further references). The Court does not find persuasive the Government’s argument that by reason of his legal background and position of authority, the applicant should have shown particular meticulousness in his choice of words. Firstly, he was speaking for the benefit of a lay audience of television viewers, rather than to a legal forum. The word “search” is common and acceptable in everyday language to describe adequately the essence of the procedure to which Ms A. was subjected. In those circumstances, the applicant could not be held accountable for his choice of words to the same standard of precision as could be expected of him when delivering a speech before a court of law or making written submissions to the same. Secondly, the format of the discussion between the applicant and a State official was designed to encourage an exchange of views or even an argument, in such a way that the opinions expressed would counterbalance each other and the debate would hold the viewers’ attention. The presenter fed questions to the participants, some of which hinted at the existing tension in the relationship between the Ministry of Justice and the Moscow Bar. As the discussion was broadcast live, the applicant was unable to reformulate or refine his words before they were made public. Further, the other participant to the debate was a representative of the Ministry of Justice. As he was given the floor after the applicant (see paragraph 14 above), he could have dispelled any allegation which he considered to be untrue and presented his own version of the incident, which however he chose not to do (compare Filatenko v. Russia, no. 73219/01, § 41, 6 December 2007, and Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 49, ECHR 2003-XI)."

Mr Buksman was connected with the presenter via a direct link, the defendant Mr Reznik was present in the studio.

The participants put questions to each other and replied to questions from the presenters. ...",

During the show “The Country and the World” on 25 December 2003, a public official and a lawyer held a discussion in which they expressed different opinions on the same event. The statements by the defendant Mr Reznik were not offensive and did not damage the plaintiffs’ honour, dignity or professional reputation. The defendant, in his reply to the presenter’s question, did not mention either remand prison no. 1 or the plaintiffs F. and B. ...",

In the instant case, the statements by the defendant, Mr Reznik, did not contain allegations about the plaintiff, remand prison no. 1, nor did Mr Reznik’s statements damage its reputation. It follows that the claims by remand prison no. 1 are unlawful and unjustified because the plaintiff seeks the rectification of allegations concerning its employees.",

The law distinguishes between the terms ‘inspection’ and ‘search’, and the defendant Mr Rezink, a professional lawyer, could not have been unaware of that distinction. Although he had at his disposal reliable information that the prison officers had carried out an inspection of Ms A.’s documents rather than searched her, he made untrue statements in a live television show ...",

The audience had viewed him as a well-informed person who was competent to assess alleged breaches of the rights of lawyers and to take appropriate action.

Accordingly, the following sentences could only be interpreted as an outline of the findings, that is, the established facts and the characterisation given to them in law.

The names of the prison warders had been public knowledge because they had been previously mentioned in the other media. In the Government’s submission, for the defamation claim to be granted, it was sufficient that at least one television viewer – including lawyers, prison employees, and parents and friends of the plaintiffs – could make a connection between the applicant’s allegation of unlawful action on the part of prison warders on the one hand, and Mr F. and Mr B. on the other. The detailed description of the situation that the applicant had given had made their identification “simple and evident”. Moreover, the way in which the applicant had described the incident and whether or not the word “rummaged” had been damaging for the plaintiffs’ reputation were irrelevant.

An “inspection” could be carried out also by men if the prohibited items were surrendered voluntarily or if the inspection only concerned the belongings rather than the persona of the offender. The Government alleged that the applicant had craftily confused the terms “search” and “inspection”, claiming that there had been no grounds to carry out a search. Indeed, there had been no grounds for a search and Ms A. had not been searched, but an inspection had been required on the basis of section 34 of the Pre-Trial Detention Act because Ms A. had been suspected of passing prohibited material from Mr Khodorkovskiy.

His statements had amounted to a negative assessment of Mr F.’s and Mr B.’s performance of their professional duties and had groundlessly tarnished the professional reputation of the remand prison.

Ms A. had confirmed before the District Court that the warders had snatched the materials from her while she was holding them against her chest. Mr B.’s report of 11 November 2003 had also mentioned that an inspection had been carried out of A.’s “belongings and clothing”, and that she had resisted the removal of the materials. That could only be construed as an indication of close physical contact between the male warders and Ms A."

                "38. The applicant pointed out that there was a close proximity between the words “search” and “inspection” in everyday use. He had not been talking for the benefit of his learned colleagues, but rather to a television audience, employing language that was accessible and understandable for ordinary viewers. For lay people, the nuances of the legal meaning of the terms “search” and “inspection” were indistinguishable and could as well be used as synonyms. The applicant observed that even the Russian laws did not give a precise definition of those terms by which they could be distinguished. He also cited a number of publications in the printed media relating to the same incident that had used the words “search/searched”, but which had not prompted a defamation claim on the part of the remand prison or its warders."

                "39. In sum, the applicant considered that he had presented his balanced subjective view on the incident involving Ms A., which had rested on the findings of an inquiry by the Moscow Bar. The inquiry had concluded that the inspection of Ms A. had been carried out in breach of the applicable laws. The inquiry had disproved the allegation that Ms A. had been carrying a note from Mr Khodorkovskiy, which allegation the prison employees had invoked as a ground for examining her belongings and clothing. Irrespective of whether the procedure was to be described as a “search” or an “inspection”, in either case it was unlawful for male warders to examine a female lawyer. The applicant had thus related, comprehensively and in good faith, the facts as he knew them, without resorting to any exaggeration or exceeding the acceptable limits of freedom of speech. The interference had not been necessary in a democratic society and the judgment of the Moscow City Court had had a “chilling effect” not just on the applicant but also on other legal professionals, averting them from contributing to debates on current issues of public interest."

It is common ground between the parties that the City Court’s judgment in the defamation proceedings constituted an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 § 1. The interference had a lawful basis, notably Article 152 of the Civil Code, which allowed the aggrieved party to seek the judicial protection of his reputation and claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damages. It also pursued a legitimate aim, that of protecting the reputation or rights of others, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2."

            [
                "42. What remains to be established is whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. The test of necessity requires the Court to determine whether the interference corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 45, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. The Court’s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Dichand and Others v. Austria, no. 29271/95, § 38, 26 February 2002, with further references)."

            [
                "43. The Court notes at the outset the particular context of the instant case. The statement which gave rise to the defamation action was made by the applicant during a live television debate in which he and an official from the Moscow Department of the Ministry of Justice took part. The discussion revolved around the move by the Ministry of Justice to have Ms A., legal counsel for Mr Khodorkovskiy, disbarred. Mr Khodorkovskiy – formerly one of the wealthiest individuals in Russia and a controlling shareholder of a major oil company (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 7, 31 May 2011) – had at that time been imprisoned in a Moscow remand centre. The criminal proceedings against him and the strategy of his defence were matters of intense public and media attention. The request to have a member of his defence team disbarred must have sparked a further wave of public interest. However, there is nothing in the text of the Moscow City Court’s judgment to suggest that the City Court performed a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiffs’ reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest (see Godlevskiy v. Russia, no. 14888/03, § 41, 23 October 2008, and Krasulya v. Russia, no. 12365/03, § 38, 22 February 2007). The Court finds that the domestic court failed to recognise that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of the reputation (see Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 33, 14 October 2008)."
            ],
            [
                "44. The applicant is a professional lawyer and the President of the Moscow Bar. Admittedly, the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts, and such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar. However, as the Court has repeatedly emphasised, lawyers are entitled to freedom of expression too and they have the right to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, §§ 173-174, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII; Amihalachioaie v. Moldova, no. 60115/00, § 27, ECHR 2004 ‑ III; and Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ II, with further references). The Court does not find persuasive the Government’s argument that by reason of his legal background and position of authority, the applicant should have shown particular meticulousness in his choice of words. Firstly, he was speaking for the benefit of a lay audience of television viewers, rather than to a legal forum. The word “search” is common and acceptable in everyday language to describe adequately the essence of the procedure to which Ms A. was subjected. In those circumstances, the applicant could not be held accountable for his choice of words to the same standard of precision as could be expected of him when delivering a speech before a court of law or making written submissions to the same. Secondly, the format of the discussion between the applicant and a State official was designed to encourage an exchange of views or even an argument, in such a way that the opinions expressed would counterbalance each other and the debate would hold the viewers’ attention. The presenter fed questions to the participants, some of which hinted at the existing tension in the relationship between the Ministry of Justice and the Moscow Bar. As the discussion was broadcast live, the applicant was unable to reformulate or refine his words before they were made public. Further, the other participant to the debate was a representative of the Ministry of Justice. As he was given the floor after the applicant (see paragraph 14 above), he could have dispelled any allegation which he considered to be untrue and presented his own version of the incident, which however he chose not to do (compare Filatenko v. Russia, no. 73219/01, § 41, 6 December 2007, and Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 49, ECHR 2003-XI)."
            ],
            [
                "45. The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism. Those principles also apply in the sphere of television and radio broadcasting (see Godlevskiy, cited above, § 44; Filatenko, cited above, § 45, and Dyuldin and Kislov v. Russia, no. 25968/02, § 44, 31 July 2007). It is an uncontested fact in the instant case that neither the individual plaintiffs – two prison warders – nor the suing legal entity – a Moscow remand centre – had been named in the applicant’s speech. The City Court accepted, nevertheless, that all of them were entitled to sue in defamation because the applicant’s intervention had been preceded by some footage showing the remand centre building. The Government also added that the prison warders had been identifiable because their names had been publicised by other media. Those reasons do not appear sufficient to the Court. The discussion was broadcast live and the applicant could not have been aware of any footage that the editor had chosen to use as an introduction to the debate. The Government’s contention that the names of Mr B. and Mr F. had entered the public domain was not substantiated with any material from the printed or visual media, whereas the applicant produced a selection of newspaper articles, all of which referred to them as “prison officers”, without giving their name or rank. In any event, the extent of the applicant’s liability in defamation must not go beyond his own words and he may not be held responsible for statements or allegations made by others, be it a television editor or journalists. The fact remains that there was nothing in the applicant’s statement to permit identification of the plaintiffs whom he described impersonally as “men”, without mentioning their names or employer. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to adduce sufficient reasons for establishing an objective link between the statement in question and the individual claimants in the defamation action."
            ],
            [
                "46. Turning to the content of the applicant’s statement, the Court considers that it need not rule on the parties’ controversy over whether it was a value judgment or a factual allegation. The Court has constantly held that even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive and that the relevant test is whether a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation can be established (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 78, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, ECHR 2001 ‑ II, and De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I). The applicant said that counsel A. had not attempted to take out any material from her client and that there had accordingly been no reason to subject her to a search. He added that the search had been carried out by men who had “rummaged” about her body. The Moscow City Court in its judgment, and subsequently the Government in their submissions to the Court, did not take issue with the word “rummaged” used by the applicant, but insisted that the statement was defamatory because it implied a breach of law committed by the prison warders."
            ],
            [
                "47. The Court has already examined the incident involving Ms A. in the application lodged by her client, Mr Khodorkovskiy. It established, in particular, that no obvious provision of Russian law prohibited counsel from keeping notes during meetings with a client and that section 34 of the Pre-trial Detention Act concerning inspection of visitors carrying prohibited objects (cited in paragraph 27 above) did not seem to be applicable in the context of meetings between the defendant and counsel. Against that background, the Court found that Ms A.’s note “[had been] to all intents and purposes privileged material, that the authorities had [had] no reasonable cause to believe that the lawyer-client privilege was being abused, and that the note [had been] obtained from Ms A. deliberately and in an arbitrary fashion” (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, §§ 199-201). Similar findings were contained in the Moscow Bar Council’s decision rejecting a request by the Ministry of Justice for the disbarment of Ms A. (see paragraph 18 above). Those findings constituted a sufficient factual basis for the applicant’s statement that the inspection of Ms A. had been devoid of legal grounds."
            ],
            [
                "48. As to the treatment which, according to the applicant, had been inflicted on Ms A. by prison warders, the Government drew a distinction between a “search” and an “inspection”, claiming that the latter – by contrast with the former – could also be carried out by men and, in addition, that a female warder had taken part in the inspection. The Court notes at the outset that the presence of a woman appears to be a conjecture resulting from a signature on the inspection report which could be read as either a male (“L-vich”) or a female (“L-va”) last name. In fact, no woman by the name of L-va or any other name was ever mentioned in the domestic proceedings, whereas the male warder L-vich was called to testify and appeared before the District Court. Mr L-vich confirmed in the witness stand that he had been in the office where Ms A. and warders B. and F. had been present, that he had removed a document from Ms A. and that he had signed the inspection report (see paragraph 16 above)."
            ],
            [
                "49. The Court does not consider it decisive that the applicant described the procedure as a “search” rather than as an “inspection”. Firstly, as it has observed above, subtle nuances of legal terminology would not be significant for a lay audience of television viewers. Secondly, the thrust of the applicant’s invective was directed at the male warders who had taken it upon themselves to examine the female counsel’s clothing. This constituted a departure from the requirements of the domestic law, which explicitly provided that both a personal inspection and a body search should be carried out by persons of the same sex and in the presence of two attesting witnesses (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Lastly, the Court observes that the personal inspection report indicated that the warders had examined not just the belongings but also the clothing of Ms A. She stated in the defamation proceedings that they had removed from her the printed media that she had been clutching to her chest (see paragraph 17 above). Even though the word “rummage” appears somewhat exaggerated, the Court does not consider that the applicant went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism, as he was seeking a way to convey his indignation at the actions by the male warders. In the light of the above, the Court finds that the applicant’s statements rested on a sufficient factual basis and that the Moscow City Court did not base its decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

As regards the sanction imposed on the applicant, the Court recalls the “chilling effect” that the fear of sanction has on the exercise of freedom of expression (see, among many others, Nikula, cited above, § 54, and Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 114, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is likewise a factor which concerns the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanctions imposed on the applicant, who, as the Court has held above, was entitled to bring the matter at issue to the public’s attention. Although the penalty of 20 Russian roubles was negligible in pecuniary terms, the institution of defamation proceedings against the President of the Moscow City Bar in the context of the present case was capable of having a chilling effect on his freedom of expression. In any event, the sanction was not justified in the light of the factors set out above (compare Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 109, 7 February 2012)."

However, the Court considers that the present case should be distinguished from the Janowski and Nikula cases for the following reasons: First, the complainants in issue were neither law-enforcement officers nor prosecutors; it would go too far to extend the Janowski principle to all persons who are employed by the State or by State-owned companies: Second, the applicant's remarks formed part of an open and ongoing discussion of matters of public interest. In this context the Court notes that, during the period from 19 June to 14 August 1998, the weekly “Express” published three articles related to the topic of the sale of State-owned aircraft and the wider question of the State administration of civil aviation, raising as it did an important issue of public concern, namely the management and alleged misuse of public funds.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Whilst certainty in the law is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Rekvényi v.

Defamation laws, with their emphasis on honour and reputation, inevitably involve a degree of vagueness (see, Rekvényi v. Hungary, cited above, § 34). However this does not remove their “legal” character for purposes of Article 10 of the Convention. It falls to the national authorities to apply and to interpret domestic law (see, for example, Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria, judgment of 20 September 1994, Series A no. 295-A, p. 17, § 45).

Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of \"the protection of the reputation or rights of others\", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (see, for instance, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, § 59)."

These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of private individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II, p. 500, § 39, and Fressoz and Roire v.

Austria, no. 26958/95, § 42, ECHR 2001 ‑ II).

Poland judgment, cited above, § 30, and the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, § 28).

However, the Court considers that the present case should be distinguished from the Janowski and Nikula cases for the following reasons: First, the complainants in issue were neither law-enforcement officers nor prosecutors; it would go too far to extend the Janowski principle to all persons who are employed by the State or by State-owned companies: Second, the applicant's remarks formed part of an open and ongoing discussion of matters of public interest. In this context the Court notes that, during the period from 19 June to 14 August 1998, the weekly “Express” published three articles related to the topic of the sale of State-owned aircraft and the wider question of the State administration of civil aviation, raising as it did an important issue of public concern, namely the management and alleged misuse of public funds. Moreover, in contrast to the statements made by the applicant as a private individual in the case of Janowski, the impugned article in the present case was written by the applicant in his capacity as a journalist and gave rise to issues of freedom of the press."

The experts had not stated whether Alimta in combination with another product was better than Vinorelbine in combination with another product.

Subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions. That was the only real conversation she had had with S. The next time she had called him, he had put down the receiver.

She was not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with Alimta was better than a combination with another medicinal product ... ”.",

Patients had been given the impression in the media that Alimta was a miracle cure. Therefore Copenhagen University Hospital had introduced it as an option. Today, Alimta is used in combination with Carboplatin as the standard therapy for inoperable patients ... Sometimes in autumn 2008, the standard therapy for operable patients had been changed to Cisplatin in combination with Alimta. If some patients were offered Alimta everybody had to be offered Alimta ... After the programme had been broadcast ... patients started mistrusting the Vinorelbine therapy. Afterwards it was not possible to perform the trial [phase II] on this drug. Nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial. Therefore no trial had been performed of Vinorelbine ... he had provided the information included in professor M ’ s memorandum of 23 September 2008 ... he had talked to [the first applicant] several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy ... he had also lost confidence in [the first applicant] ... ”",

The approval of Alimta by the Danish Medicines Agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug, which means that advertisement of the product is permitted. Vinorelbine has also been approved by the Danish Medicines Agency, but for a wide range of oncological therapies ... in 2003 when Alimta was tested [phase III] the bar had been set quite low. The study compared Alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody. It would have been more relevant to study Alimta in combination with Cisplatin versus Vinorelbine with Cisplatin .... S has made a phase II trial of the standard therapy [ Vinorelbine ] ... Subsequently the standard therapy regimen has been expanded to include Alimta, which is not a better product than Vinorelbine, but eight times more expensive ... if two drugs are equally effective, but one of them is eight times more expensive than the other, patients will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug. ... The standard therapies now offered by Copenhagen University Hospital are Vinorelbine in combination with Cisplatin for inoperable patients and Alimta in combination with Cisplatin for operable patients ... the shift to Alimta as the standard therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital did not reflect that Alimta was medically better. The [applicants ’ ] programme had had a large impact as patients were asking not to be treated with Vinorelbine. Copenhagen University Hospital had therefore had to change medical products because patients had the clear impression that Vinorelbine was not as good as Alimta ... It is quite usual for Copenhagen University Hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer questions, but the questions of [the first applicant] were never-ending. Copenhagen University Hospital has spent about a man-year, or about DKK 400,000, responding to inquiries from [the first applicant], and huge efforts had been made to accommodate her requests ... the programme had created distrust towards both Copenhagen University Hospital and S and had created uncertainty in both patients and relatives.

Moreover, the phrase “the only drug with a known effect” was used.",

In the applicants ’ opinion it would seriously harm democratic principles and legal certainty if the State were able to protect itself from public scrutiny by limiting the freedom of expression of a journalist where a public body is involved.

It presented the patients ’ and the families ’ frustrations over being denied the choice of their preferred chemotherapy, especially given the fact that Alimta had undergone phase III examination and thus was more thoroughly tested than Vinorelbine.

The applicants acted in good faith and in full compliance with press ethics when preparing and airing the programme. Both S and Copenhagen University Hospital were invited to comment on the allegations in the documentary on numerous occasions.

The subject matter, that the patients and their families felt that they were not being properly informed and given the choice of which chemotherapy treatment they preferred at Copenhagen University Hospital, was clearly of public interest, and the documentary gave rise to a broad public debate. The impact was significant and had various important consequences, inter alia, a public demand for Alimta therapy and a change in practice at Copenhagen University Hospital, all of which highlighted why this kind of journalism was essential and indispensable in a democratic society."

They gave a distorted picture of the content of the documentary and the responsibility of the journalist reporting what was being said by others. The applicants noted, for example, that the charge against them did not relate to any specific statements in the documentary and that the domestic courts did not mention any specific statements by the applicants which were considered incorrect. Moreover, the voice-overs provided in the programme should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the journalistic production as a whole with respect for the function of the documentary and of the documentary genre as a dissemination tool for statements of named third parties. The High Court performed a crucial change of the conclusions of the documentary by finding that the programme gave a defamatory impression that Alimta was a superior product and that S had caused unnecessary death for his personal benefit. This was clearly not stated in the documentary. The judicial authorities placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on the applicants requiring, under criminal law, that they provide medical documentation about Alimta compared to Vinorelbine. The wording of the High Court judgment also indicated that there had been no specific assessment by the judges of the value of the documentary to general society."

Finally, the applicants submitted that the penalties imposed were disproportionate to the harm alleged and likely to deter journalists from performing their essential role as “public watchdogs” and keeping the public informed about matters of public interest.

                "34. The Government maintained that the interference was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others. They referred to case-law in which the Court had presupposed that a public body could also fall within “the protection of the reputation or rights of others”, for example, Romanenko and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 39; Lombardo and Others v. Malta, no. 7333/06, §§ 50 and 54, 24 April 2007; and Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239. They further contended that since it was recognised that the reputation of the police may be a legitimate aim, the same should apply to several other public bodies. The conditions at a public hospital constitute an issue of considerable public interest and entail a need for wider limits for public scrutiny, but this is partly for other reasons than for a public body exercising power in the traditional sense. Public interest may therefore be deemed to be interconnected with the relevance of the activities of the hospital to the life and health of individuals. Allegations made on a factually incorrect basis will affect the patient ’ s confidence in the treatment offered and may weaken the possibilities of the hospital to function in an optimal manner. In addition, it would amount to unfounded arbitrariness in the protection of the health interests of the contracting States if they were to have the possibility of interfering with attacks on the reputation of private hospitals but not of public hospitals."

It concerned defamatory statements independently worded and made by the applicants, notably when they had used the voice-over to convey the impression to the viewers that improper treatment had been given and that this was S ’ s deliberate choice, motivated by his desire for professional esteem and his personal financial situation. This should lead to a stricter assessment of the applicants ’ defamatory statements when balanced against the protection of the reputation or rights of S and Copenhagen University Hospital."

Referring to the High Court ’ s finding, the Government maintained that the applicants did not act on a factually correct basis, nor did they provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism when making their very serious allegations. They did not act in good faith. Among other things, they deliberately omitted to inform the viewers that according to the research material available to them, the effect of Vinorelbine had been documented, and that there was no basis for stating that Alimta -based chemotherapy was more effective than the Vinorelbine ‑ based treatment offered by Copenhagen University Hospital. They also omitted to mention that Copenhagen University Hospital, in a memorandum of 11 June 2018 to the applicants, had given a thorough account of the reasons for the medical product chosen, and an explanation of the research, which emphasised that the doctors involved did not themselves benefit financially. Furthermore, as stated by the High Court, by not defining the term “approved” or the difference between a drug approved for treatment and a drug approved for marketing, and by consistently using the term “experimental drug”, the applicants made accusations resting on a factually incorrect basis, of which they must be deemed to have become aware through the research material."

The aim could have been achieved, however, without making the impugned accusations. They also pointed out that the High Court found that it had not been substantiated that there was any medical difference between Vinorelbine and Alimta, which was also the conclusion of the independent medical oncologist of the Patient Insurance Association. The changes of treatment regime at Copenhagen University Hospital caused by the programme thus illustrated that allegations made by the press on a factually incorrect basis may harm individuals ’ confidence in the national health authorities."

Russia (no. 27447/07, § 25, 8 October 2015) concerning a University ’ s authority, the Court went on to consider the issue in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference. It did state, though (ibid. § 29), that the protection of the University ’ s authority is a mere institutional interest of the University, that is, a consideration not necessarily of the same strength as “the protection of the reputation or rights of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 (see Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, § 22, 19 July 2011). The latter reference concerned a State-owned company in respect of which the Court observed (ibid. § 22);",
                "“ ... the impugned criminal charges were pressed by a company which undisputedly has a right to defend itself against defamatory allegations. In this context the Court accepts that, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good. The State therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 94, ECHR 2005-II; Kuliś and Różycki v. Poland, no. 27209/03, § 35, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). However, there is a difference between the commercial reputational interests of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status. Whereas the latter might have repercussions on one ’ s dignity, for the Court interests of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension. In the instant application, the reputational interest at stake is that of a State-owned corporation; it is thus a commercial one without relevance to moral character.”"

In the present case, the High Court found that the applicants, as producer of the programme and as chief sub-editor, had made an allegation against Copenhagen University Hospital and S of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients, and that such an accusation was likely to disparage Copenhagen University Hospital and S in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in Article 267 of the Penal Code (see paragraph 19 above)."

The Court notes, in addition, that the impugned allegations were strongly linked to S and his alleged motives for using the product Vinorelbine on his patients suffering from mesothelioma. The allegations were also found to be defamatory for Copenhagen University Hospital which, in the Court ’ s view, rather acted as the representative for its unnamed management and staff, who were also concerned by the accusations in the programme, than being a mere institution representing its interests in the form of prestige or commercial success. The case thus appears comparable to the situation in Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland (cited above). In such circumstances the Court can agree with the Government that there is no basis in the notion of “others” set out in the second paragraph of Article 10 to distinguish between attacks on the reputation of medical staff at private hospitals as opposed to public hospitals."

The Court has to examine the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

As regards, in particular, protection of the reputation of an individual, the Court has held that a person ’ s reputation, even if that person is being criticised in the context of a public debate, forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore falls within the scope of his or her “private life”. In order for Article 8 to come into play, though, the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see, inter alia, (see Delfi, cited above, § 137; Axel Springer AG v.

France [GC], no. 40454/07, §§ 83 to 93, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). The criteria which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life are, inter alia : the contribution to a debate of general interest; how well-known the person concerned is and what the subject of the report is; his or her prior conduct; the method of obtaining the information and its veracity; the content, form and consequences of the publication; and the severity of the sanction imposed (see, for example, Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v.

In the present case, the impugned criticism was directed at S and Copenhagen University Hospital, being a public hospital, including its unnamed management and staff, who were also concerned by the accusations in the programme (see paragraph 49 above). They were all vested with official functions. The Court reiterates in this respect that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as concerns public figures than private individuals (see, for example, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], cited above, §§ 117 to 123, with further references). The Government also accepted that in the present case, there was a need for wider limits for public scrutiny, not because Copenhagen University Hospital could be compared to a public body exercising power in the traditional sense, but rather because the activities of the hospital and its conditions had an impact on the life and health of individuals. A similar view was expressed by the High Court (see paragraph 58 above) when pointing out that in respect of public hospital treatment, when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies, the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale.",

                "“With these statements, [the applicants] not only passed on assertions by patients, relatives and experts, but also took a stand, so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at Copenhagen University Hospital, in that S has deliberately used medication ( Vinorelbine ), which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer, and whose effect has not been substantiated, that the medication in question was part of a test, and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened. The way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending, the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication [ Vinorelbine ] were S ’ s professional prestige and personal finances.",

That information was confirmed by the professor from Switzerland in an email of 25 June 2008 and by the medical doctor from Grosshandorf Hospital in Germany in an email of 27 June 2008 (see paragraph 13 above).

At the same time, in applying the standards of journalistic diligence it is necessary to consider the nature of the publications. In particular, differences between papers written by journalists and interviews have to be taken into account. The Court attaches importance to the fact that the material published by the applicant was an interview and not a general article. Thus the applicant did not publish his own statements but those made by a third person, namely A.R. The text of the interview had been sent to A.R. prior to publication in order to allow A.R. to ascertain whether her statements had been accurately cited and, possibly, to make corrections. A.R. returned the text to the applicant without any comments or corrections. This was confirmed by A.R. before the Regional Court in the course of criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In the Court ’ s view a journalist cannot always be reasonably expected to check all the information provided in an interview. There is no reason to doubt the good faith of the journalist in the instant case."

In addition, the fairness of the proceedings, the procedural guarantees afforded (see, mutatis mutandis, Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005 ‑ II) and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed (see Ceylan v.

Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for \"the protection of the reputation of ... others\", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 59, Series A no. 216; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 59, ECHR 1999 ‑ III; and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 89, ECHR 2015 (extracts) )."

At the same time, the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentikäinen v.

The interview concerned principally the “sex scandal” in Samoobrona, which had broken previously in Poland and which had been widely publicised and had attracted great public attention, particularly because that party had been part of the Polish Government at the relevant time.

At the same time, in applying the standards of journalistic diligence it is necessary to consider the nature of the publications. In particular, differences between papers written by journalists and interviews have to be taken into account. The Court attaches importance to the fact that the material published by the applicant was an interview and not a general article. Thus the applicant did not publish his own statements but those made by a third person, namely A.R. The text of the interview had been sent to A.R. prior to publication in order to allow A.R. to ascertain whether her statements had been accurately cited and, possibly, to make corrections. A.R. returned the text to the applicant without any comments or corrections. This was confirmed by A.R. before the Regional Court in the course of criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In the Court ’ s view a journalist cannot always be reasonably expected to check all the information provided in an interview. There is no reason to doubt the good faith of the journalist in the instant case."

As regards the Government ’ s arguments that the applicant should have distanced himself from the statements made by A.R. , the Court notes that the interview concerned the “ sex scandal ” and the applicant ’ s attempts to obtain information on this matter. A.R. stated that two men – K. Z. and B.S. – had sexually propositioned her. She also mentioned K.S. from whom she had allegedly requested help at a party (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). All three of those men were asked to comment and their statements were printed next to the interview (see paragraph 10 above). M.C. ’ s name did not appear in the interview in the context of the “ sex scandal ”; it was mentioned by A.R., who said that B.S. had promised to support her candidature for a position at M. C. ’ s office in Brussels. The applicant only then asked whether she had got the job and A.R. replied that the job had been given to M. C. ’ s daughter. The Court notes in this context that the interview did not focus on M.C.; his name only appeared there because A.R. had mentioned it only in connection with B.S. ’ s promise. In these circumstances the Court is of the opinion that the applicant could not have been reasonably expected to ask M.C. to comment, as he did with K.Z., B.S. and K.S. who, according to the applicant ’ s statements, were either directly involved in the “ sex scandal ” or witnessed the situation discussed in the interview (as regards the requirement of establishing the truth of reported statements made by third persons see, mutatis mutandis, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, § 65, Series A no. 239, and as regards the requirement that a journalist distance himself from the reported statements, see Thoma, cited above, § 64 )."

As regards the reasons given by the domestic courts proving the applicant ’ s criminal responsibility, the Court notes that the second - instance court, addressing the applicant ’ s argument raised in his appeal, examined the case also from the standpoint of Article 10 of the Convention. This court found that freedom of expression was not unlimited and that the Convention did not provide for protection of those who in exercising their freedom breached another ’ s right to good name and reputation (see paragraph 17 above). However, the domestic court did not carry out a balancing exercise of the competing interests at stake seen in the context in which the disputed remarks were made (as regards the requirement of carrying out a balancing exercise, see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, §§ 113-115, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 108, ECHR 2012; and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 82 ‑ 84, 7 February 2012 )."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Sürek, cited above, § 64, and Chauvy and Others, cited above, § 78). In the present case the courts conditionally discharged the applicant; however the information about this fact appears in the National Criminal Register (see paragraph 35 above). Although the Court has found on many occasions that a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004 - II) it considers that, in the instant case, which concerns recourse to a criminal prosecution resulting in a finding of criminal responsibility must be seen as a wholly disproportionate measure (see, mutatis mutandis, Długołęcki v.

It was primarily aimed at keeping the public informed about the salaries paid in the public sector at a time of economic crisis, when a variety of austerity measures had been introduced. It is not insignificant that, around the same time, legislative amendments were being drafted to make information concerning salaries in public institutions available to the general public (see paragraph 39 above). In addition, the applicant ’ s broadcast also exposed security flaws in the database of the State Revenue Service, which had been discovered by her source. Admittedly, the actions of her source are subject to a pending criminal investigation. The applicant herself, however, for the purposes of this investigation was questioned as a witness; it appears that her procedural status remained unaltered throughout this investigation. The Court emphasises that the right of journalists not to disclose their sources cannot be considered a mere privilege to be granted or taken away depending on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their sources, but is part and parcel of the right to information, to be treated with the utmost caution (see Tillack, cited above, § 65). Given the multiple interests in issue, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source will merely operate as one factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see Financial Times Ltd and Others, cited above, § 63)."

This does not mean the absolute immunity of a journalist in criminal proceedings, but the necessity to respect journalists ’ professional interests and legal guarantees.",
                "The decision of the competent investigating authorities to search the applicant ’ s place of residence was based on the information made public in the De facto broadcast. According to the list of objects searched, it was important to secure the evidence and to clarify how the journalist had received the information about the data “leak” from SRS EDS, and who was guilty. The wording used in the search warrant – “information about the obtaining and distribution” – clearly demonstrates the purpose of the competent investigating authorities to identify the journalistic source.",
                "That being so, the activities of the competent investigating authorities in the particular case concern[ed] the protection of journalistic sources and thus interfere[d] with the journalist ’ s freedom of expression.",
                "At the same time, the protection of journalistic sources is not absolute and may be restricted in certain cases in the public interest. This means that the competent investigating authorities, when taking a decision affecting a journalist, should evaluate the aspects of restriction of freedom of expression and the proportionality of such action - is the disclosure of such information truly necessary? Or maybe there are reasonable alternative measures, as specified in Principle 3 of the Recommendation [ No. R(2000) 7 ].",
                "[Reference to sections 12, 154, 179 and 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law ] Therefore, there is a legal basis for disclosure of journalistic sources, for searches and also for the lawful and proportionate restriction of human rights in criminal proceedings. It follows that such restrictions are prescribed by law.",
                "To assess the proportionality of those restrictions and the possibility of applying less harmful alternative means of achieving the aim, the Ombudsman asked the responsible authorities whether, for the purpose of obtaining information from the journalist, there had been sufficient grounds to opt for an emergency search out of all options offered by the [ Criminal Procedure Law ], rather than for a disclosure order under section 154 of the [ Criminal Procedure Law ].",
                "[The prosecutor ’ s office] replied that the purpose of the search had been to substantiate and obtain evidence in criminal proceedings, and not to identify the journalistic source, which was already known to the police; that was why disclosure under section 154 of the [Criminal Procedure Law ] was not ordered. The prosecutor ’ s office held the view that it had no right to give any opinion on the validity of the investigative action, since the activities of the investigating judge who approved the search had been examined by the President of the court.",
                "The court substantiated the need for a search under the urgent procedure by the fact that in criminal proceedings involving a flow of electronic documents it was necessary to take into account the specifics of cybercrimes, where the preservation, obtaining and recording of electronic evidence was rather delicate because such evidence could be altered and destroyed very quickly and irreversibly.",
                "Such a statement should be considered critically, since the officers of the State Police turned to the applicant with the request to provide information on her source on 19 February 2010, but the search under the urgent procedure was carried out on 11 May 2010. The materials submitted by the State authorities and the court to the Ombudsman do not contain any evidence of attempts by the journalist to continue unlawfully processing and further distributing the data, or to destroy such information.",
                "The need to conduct the search under the urgent procedure has also not been explained in the assessment provided by the court, if the materials of the case provided sufficient basis to consider that the applicant most likely knew, supported or participated in the crime under investigation by simultaneously using the information for journalistic purposes. If the competent investigating authority had such information at the time of making the decision on conducting the search, it is not clear why the police did not apply the status of a suspect to the journalist before the search and did not search the journalist ’ s place of work.",
                "It is considered established that the decision of the court is based upon assumptions, and in reaching the decision the court has not respected the status of the journalist, whose immunity and protection against disclosure of the information source are established in the law.",
                "Consequently, it can be concluded that by approving the search warrant issued by the competent investigating authority under the urgent procedure, the supervising prosecutor and the court made no critical assessment of the need for and validity of those actions.",
                "The Ombudsman has reservations as to whether a search at the applicant ’ s home under the urgent procedure was actually the most reasonable means of putting a stop to the disclosure of information at that point in the proceedings. In order to ensure compliance with the key principles of criminal proceedings established under section 12 of the [the Criminal Procedure Law ], the competent investigating authority should have given more careful consideration to whether the information necessary for the investigation could have been obtained by means less harmful to the interests of the person. ”",

                "Accordingly, the freedom of expression and the right not to disclose journalistic sources enshrined in the Constitution and binding international treaties have been violated.",
                "Since the legally protected immunity of a journalist in criminal proceedings is not incorporated in [the relevant chapter of the Criminal Procedure Law ] and the domestic case-law shows that the competent investigating authorities do not pay sufficient attention to it, it would be advisable to initiate a discussion on [legislative] amendments [to the relevant provision of the Criminal Procedure Law ].

They considered that the applicant should have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court if she considered that the procedure under section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law as applied to her lacked sufficient procedural guarantees, or that the failure to provide additional statutory safeguards in respect of journalists regarding non-disclosure privilege (sections 121 and 122 of the Criminal Procedure Law ) had interfered with her human rights.

In the applicant ’ s case the search warrant did not contain any exceptions or limitations on the search or the documents to be seized that might safeguard her right not to disclose her sources or any information leading to them. The applicant did not contest that a judicial review as such was possible. She was rather of the opinion that it had not been possible for the investigating judge to make a proper assessment as there were no clear criteria or guidance in the domestic law as regards searches of journalists, save for cases when a court order under section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Law was issued, which was not the case here."

She emphasised that the information she had reported on served a legitimate public interest and contributed to the public debate on solidarity regarding the implementation of austerity measures. No personal information that did not serve that purpose had been revealed and no claims had been lodged in that regard by the individuals concerned. Therefore, there had been no reason to consider that any further disclosure of data by the applicant would be in breach of any Article 8 rights.

The applicant argued that a fair balance should have been struck in the present case between the general public interest in the protection of journalistic sources and the interests of the investigation. The criminal investigation had related to alleged arbitrary access to the EDS database. It had never been disputed that poor security had made the access possible. If any crime had been committed at all, it was a minor one. It was not among the crimes listed in the above-cited Recommendation as serious enough to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s rights. Accordingly, the particular interests of the investigation were not sufficiently vital and serious to prevail over the general public interest of source protection."

In response to the Government ’ s argument that the search had not been carried out with a view to establishing the identity of the applicant ’ s source, the applicant noted that she had no way of knowing what information had been at the disposal of the authorities before the search and seizure were authorised and conducted. According to the information provided by her source, “Neo” was the head of a group of people who claimed to have discovered a means of downloading information from the EDS database without cracking any passwords, thereby revealing gaps in the VID ’ s security system. The applicant had publicly announced during the 14 February 2010 broadcast that “Neo” claimed to be leading a group who called themselves “4ATA” and whose aim, among other things, was to strive for a better future for Latvia by making sure that public officials responsible for negligence and corruption were held to account. The search warrant had also authorised the search for information concerning other members of that group."

The applicant further argued that the information contained in her data storage devices, to which the Government referred as evidence, was covered by the journalist ’ s right to protect his sources. She referred to principle 6 of the Recommendation and the terms used therein. In her view the wording “information about the obtaining and distribution of the files” used in the search warrant clearly demonstrated that the purpose was to identify the source of information or at least to verify it. The Government ’ s reference to a reasonable suspicion concerning the applicant ’ s connection with the criminal offence showed a dangerous understanding and approach by the State authorities. She referred to the Court ’ s case-law and emphasised that the right not to disclose journalistic sources was not a mere privilege which could be granted or taken away depending on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their sources (see Tillack v. Belgium, no. 20477/05, § 65, 27 November 2007)."

She had also verified the accuracy of the information. When there was no doubt that the leak had taken place and that the information was true, the applicant – acting in her capacity as a journalist and in good faith – had announced information that was of legitimate public interest. She insisted that the mere fact that a journalist had been in contact with the source or any other suspect could not be enough to allege that he or she might be connected with the criminal offence and deserved to be searched. Furthermore, the Government had not demonstrated that there had been any grounds to assume – in order to justify the search under the urgent procedure – that information or documents possessed by the applicant would be altered or destroyed. The applicant had not demonstrated any negative attitude towards the investigation other than exercising her right of non-disclosure."

At the same time, they also noted that section 180, paragraph 3, provided for an exception from the general rule in the event of particular urgency, which was sufficiently precisely defined in their view. The Government further explained that under both procedures the investigating judge and the supervising prosecutor were presented with the criminal case file in its entirety, and that they were obliged to have due regard to all the circumstances of the case, and had to consider the impact of the search on the individual ’ s human rights, including freedom of speech, in the light of the criteria set out in section 12 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

In their opinion it was doubtful that in all the Council of Europe Member States prior judicial review was ensured in all cases, without any exceptions in relation to searches carried out on journalists. In any event, where a search was authorised by the supervising prosecutor, there was a statutory requirement for immediate a posteriori judicial review by the investigating judge (see paragraph 36 above). Thus, the legislator had provided for two -tier scrutiny in cases where searches were performed under the urgent procedure."

As indicated by the the President of the court in her decision of l4 June 2010, the investigating judge had the power and the obligation to assess the scope of the information seized as a result of the search, namely, whether the information seized could possibly be related to the applicant ’ s professional activities.

Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 85-86, 7 February 2012). The Government also referred to the margin of appreciation accorded to the States in striking the appropriate balance.

Luxembourg (no. 51772/99, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV), Voskuil v. the Netherlands (no. 64752/01, 22 November 2007) and Tillack (cited above).

I.P. had been subjected to searches and had been apprehended by the police prior to the search at the applicant ’ s home. Nor was the search aimed at identifying or disclosing other sources of information. It was the Government ’ s view that the search warrant had demonstrated that its aim was both to find and seize XML files or their derivatives downloaded from the EDS database, software for processing these files, information concerning the acquisition of the files, as well as other objects containing information about the criminal offence under investigation, and to prevent further dissemination of the personal data of hundreds of thousands of people.

The Government also argued that they had to establish the applicant ’ s role – whether she had reported on the data in her capacity as a journalist, that is whether it “served legitimate journalistic purposes”, or she was the organiser, or an abettor or accomplice to the offence."

However, they chose not to do this and other investigative activities followed and the alleged perpetrator was identified by other means. The Government wished to emphasise that the domestic authorities deliberately chose to pursue a more time ‑ consuming course of investigation, thus clearly demonstrating their respect for freedom of expression and the rights of journalists not to disclose their sources.

The Court will start by addressing the Government ’ s argument that the search had not been carried out with a view to establishing the identity of the applicant ’ s source of information but rather to gather evidence in the criminal proceedings against I.P., whose identity had already been established at that point in the investigation. The Court considers that the issue to be determined in the present case is whether the search at the applicant ’ s home, who was a well-known journalist at the material time, in view of obtaining information in such circumstances falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention."

The Court does not have any reason to doubt that the domestic authorities had a reasonable suspicion that I.P. had some connection with the data leak at the time of the search at the applicant ’ s home. However, the fact remains that the investigating authorities searched the home of the applicant journalist on the basis of a wide-reaching search warrant.

Denmark (dec.), no. 40485/02, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). In that case the Court considered that Article 10 of the Convention applied even when a journalist had worked undercover and had used a hidden camera to film participants in a television programme, who could thus not be regarded as “sources of journalistic information in the traditional sense”. It was rather the compulsory handover of his research material that was susceptible of having a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression. In that case, the identity of the journalistic sources in the traditional sense was adequately protected, and the handing over of the research material in relation to an alleged perpetrator, whose actions were under criminal investigation and whose identity was known to the police, was not deemed disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and the reasons given by the national authorities were considered to be relevant and sufficient."

In the present case, irrespective of whether the identity of the applicant ’ s source was discovered during the search, as found by the Ombudsman, or at the very least confirmed during that search, as submitted by the applicant, it nevertheless remains that the seized data storage devices contained not only information capable of identifying her source of information, pertaining either to “the factual circumstances of acquiring information” from her source or to “the unpublished content” of that information, but also information capable of identifying her other sources of information. It does not need to be further demonstrated that the search yielded any results or indeed proved otherwise productive (see Roemen and Schmit, cited above, § 57, and Ernst and Others v.

The situation in Latvia in this respect, as noted by the Government, is quite different. Indeed, in accordance with the ordinary procedure under section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the investigating judge weighs the potential risks and respective interests prior to authorising a search. Also, under section 154 of the same Law the investigating judge makes this assessment prior to issuing a disclosure order.

In such situations an independent review carried out at the very least prior to the access and use of obtained materials should be sufficient to determine whether any issue of confidentiality arises, and if so, whether in the particular circumstances of the case the public interest invoked by the investigating or prosecuting authorities outweighs the general public interest of source protection (see Sanoma Uitgevers, cited above, § 91)."

The Court observes that under Latvian law the investigating judge examines “the lawfulness of and the grounds for the search” carried out under the urgent procedure on the day following the search. It cannot therefore be said that there are no safeguards that render the relevant legal provision foreseeable as such. Although it appears that the investigating judge ’ s approval of the search warrant was not made in a separate decision in the present case, but rather was limited to an “ approval ” written on the search warrant itself, the reasons for that decision were explained in writing by the President of the court upon examining the applicant ’ s complaint against the decision."

The Court notes that unlike in the Sanoma Uitgevers case, the investigating judge has the authority under Latvian law to revoke the search warrant and to declare such evidence inadmissible (see paragraph 36 above). Moreover, according to the information submitted by the Government, which the applicant did not dispute, the investigating judge also has the power to withhold the disclosure of the identity of journalistic sources ( ibid. ). The Court considers that the last two elements pertaining to the investigating judge ’ s involvement in an immediate post factum review are sufficient to differentiate this case from the above-mentioned Sanoma Uitgevers case (see also Telegraaf Media Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, § 120, 2 2 November 2012, where a similar distinction was made).

In exercising its supervisory function, the Court ’ s task is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied upon (see Axel Springer AG v.

The Court notes, at the outset, that there is a fundamental difference between this case and other cases, where disclosure orders have been served on journalists requiring them to reveal the identity of their sources (see the above-cited cases of Goodwin, Voskuil, Financial Times Ltd and Others and Telegraaf Media Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others ). The distinguishing feature lies not, as the Government suggested, in the fact that I.P. ’ s identity had been known to the investigating authorities prior to the applicant ’ s search, which fact does not remove the applicant ’ s protection under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 78 - 83 above). The Court has already held that a search conducted with a view to identifying a journalist ’ s source is a more drastic measure than an order to divulge the source ’ s identity (see the above-cited cases Roemen and Schmit, § 57, and Ernst and Others, § 103). The Court considers that it is even more so in the circumstances of the present case, where the search warrant was drafted in such vague terms as to allow the seizure of “any information” pertaining to the crime under investigation allegedly committed by the journalist ’ s source, irrespective of whether or not his identity had already been known to the investigating authorities. As the Court has already noted in Roemen and Schmit and Ernst and Others, investigators who raid a journalist ’ s workplace or home unannounced and are armed with search warrants have very wide investigative powers, as, by definition, they have access to all the documentation held by the journalist. The Court reiterates that limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources call for the most careful scrutiny by the Court."

As to the reasons for the search of 11 May 2010, the Court notes that according to the search warrant, issued by the investigator under the urgent procedure, the factual basis for the search was the applicant ’ s communication with I.P., by phone and possibly in person, on several occasions prior to the broadcast of 14 February 2010. The Government have submitted to the Court that the investigating authorities were faced with the task of classifying the crime allegedly committed by I.P. and establishing the applicant ’ s role. The Court, however, does not consider that the reasons given by the domestic authorities are “relevant” and “sufficient” in the circumstances of the present case or correspond to a “pressing social need”."

                "97. The Court notes that the subject-matter on which the applicant reported and in connection with which her home was searched made a twofold contribution to a public debate. It was primarily aimed at keeping the public informed about the salaries paid in the public sector at a time of economic crisis, when a variety of austerity measures had been introduced. It is not insignificant that, around the same time, legislative amendments were being drafted to make information concerning salaries in public institutions available to the general public (see paragraph 39 above). In addition, the applicant ’ s broadcast also exposed security flaws in the database of the State Revenue Service, which had been discovered by her source. Admittedly, the actions of her source are subject to a pending criminal investigation. The applicant herself, however, for the purposes of this investigation was questioned as a witness; it appears that her procedural status remained unaltered throughout this investigation. The Court emphasises that the right of journalists not to disclose their sources cannot be considered a mere privilege to be granted or taken away depending on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their sources, but is part and parcel of the right to information, to be treated with the utmost caution (see Tillack, cited above, § 65). Given the multiple interests in issue, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source will merely operate as one factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see Financial Times Ltd and Others, cited above, § 63)."

The Court observes that the broadcast during which the applicant informed the public about the data leak from the EDS was aired on 14 February 2010, that is, nearly three months before the search at the applicant ’ s home. According to the investigator, since that date there had been no further communication between the applicant and her source. In this respect, the Court notes that when the investigating authorities, almost three months after the broadcast and after the applicant had agreed to testify, decided that a search at her home was necessary, they proceeded under the urgent procedure without any judicial authority having properly examined the relationship of proportionality between the public interest of investigation, on the one hand, and the protection of the journalist ’ s freedom of expression, on the other hand."

According to national law, such search could be envisaged only if the delay could allow the relevant documents or objects to be destroyed, hidden or damaged or the person to abscond (see paragraph 36 above). In the case at hand, the reasons spelled out in the search warrant for the urgency was “ to prevent the destruction, concealment or damaging of evidence” without further explanation or reference to particular facts or any other indication. It is not clear from the case materials on what grounds the above-mentioned assertion was made and in what context. The Government insisted that the applicant ’ s role had not been clear at the time of the search. However, it has not been suggested that during the preliminary investigation any information was acquired linking the applicant to I.P. in any other way than in her capacity as a journalist; her status as a witness in the criminal proceedings only further evidences that. On the contrary, it was noted in the search warrant itself that the applicant ’ s last communication with I.P. had been on the day of the broadcast. In these circumstances only weighty reasons could have justified the urgency of the applicant ’ s search."

The Court has already noted above that it may be impracticable for the prosecuting authorities to state elaborate reasons for urgent searches; in such circumstances the necessary assessment of the conflicting interests could be carried out a later stage, but in any event at the very least prior to the access and use of the obtained materials (see paragraph 88 above). In Latvia, according to the Government, the assessment is carried out by the investigating judge on the next day following an urgent search. In the present case, however, no further reasons were given either by the investigating judge or by the President of the court who subsequently examined the applicant ’ s complaint against the decision of the investigating judge. Both judges limited themselves to finding that the search did not relate to the journalist ’ s sources at all, so they did not proceed to examine the conflicting interests. For the reasons explained above (see paragraphs 78 - 83 ) the Court cannot subscribe to such a finding."

The Court considers that any search involving the seizure of data storage devices such as laptops, external hard drives, memory cards and flash drives belonging to a journalist raises a question of the journalist ’ s freedom of expression including source protection and that the access to the information contained therein must be protected by sufficient and adequate safeguards against abuse. In the present case, although the investigating judge ’ s involvement in an immediate post factum review was provided for in the law, the Court finds that the investigating judge failed to establish that the interests of the investigation in securing evidence were sufficient to override the public interest in the protection of the journalist ’ s freedom of expression, including source protection and protection against the handover of the research material. The scarce reasoning of the President of the court as to the perishable nature of evidence linked to cybercrimes in general, as the Ombudsman rightly concluded, cannot be considered sufficient in the present case, given the investigating authorities ’ delay in carrying out the search and the lack of any indication of impending destruction of evidence. Nor was there any suggestion that the applicant was responsible for disseminating personal data or was implicated in the events other than in her capacity as a journalist; she remained “a witness” for the purposes of these criminal proceedings. If the case materials did include any indication in that regard, it was the investigating judge ’ s responsibility to carry out the necessary assessment of the conflicting interests, which was not done."

The Court has indicated, when reviewing legislation governing secret surveillance in the light of Article 8, that in a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 56, Series A no. 28, and Kennedy, cited above, § 167). However, in both cases the Court was prepared to accept as adequate the independent supervision available. In Klass and Others, this included a practice of seeking prior consent to surveillance measures of the G 10 Commission, an independent body chaired by a president who was qualified to hold judicial office and which moreover had the power to order the immediate termination of the measures in question ( mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others, §§ 21 and 51; see also Weber and Saravia, §§ 25 and 117).

                "“There has been what can properly be called a serious incident ( Er is sprake van een ernstig incident geweest ): a considerable collection of copied documents from a closed working file of the BVD has been taken out of the building in defiance of the rules. Operational AIVD research and research by the National Police Internal Investigations Department ( rijksrecherche ) indicate that this was probably done by a former BVD staff member, who would have had the opportunity to do so until August 2000. Possibly via third parties, the documents subsequently came into the possession of De Telegraaf, which published information about this in January of this year. I would point out that final conclusions about the way in which these compromising facts took place can formally be drawn only when the proceedings against the suspected former staff member have been brought to a close.",

Damage to investigations in process and the consequences of the working methods then in use ( modus operandi ) becoming known is relatively limited. Risks to agents and/or informants cannot however be excluded. Where necessary, operational measures have been taken to limit these risks.",
                "A reassessment in the light of the security rules in force then and now shows that there is little to be gained from more regulation. Compliance and supervision of compliance with rules and regulations will however need to be strengthened. The updated security plan and internal communication on that subject will so ensure. Technical measures, such as the introduction of new security technology in authorised systems, and measures within the area of personnel management, such as the continuation of sound security investigations and reviews of new and existing staff, will also contribute to a further reduction of security risks. Extreme alertness to signals which might indicate security risks and better (social) control of non-security-conscious behaviour are indispensible in this connection.",
                "I also conclude from the investigations that security which will completely prevent deliberate compromising [of secret information] is not achievable. It will never be possible to exclude that staff members who are authorised to take cognisance of State secrets and who deliberately seek to inflict harm will be able deliberately and unauthorised to carry State secrets outside the AIVD buildings by some means or other.",

However, the Regional Court does not consider that that right has been violated in the instant case. The Regional Court stresses that the journalists concerned have not been required to give their active co-operation to the investigation into the identity of the source, but that in the instant case all that has been sought is the handover of material that exists independently from the will of the journalists and which, in addition, is the object of a criminal act.

They claimed to be aware that the applicants De Haas and Mos had been subject to telephone tapping and observation, presumably by AIVD agents, from late January 2006 onwards. Such measures, in the contention of the applicants, lacked a legal basis, since the AIVD was using powers granted it by section 6 (2)(a) of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act ( Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten – see paragraph 51 below) to carry out duties set out in section 6(2)(c) of that Act. In the alternative, since clearly the target of the measures was the second and third applicants’ journalistic source and not the applicants themselves, basic requirements of subsidiarity and proportionality had been disregarded, the more so since the said two applicants were journalists and therefore entitled pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention to protect their journalistic sources. The applicants also claimed the protection of the second and third applicants’ private and family life, home and correspondence under Article 8 of the Convention.

They also stated that the first, second and third applicants had gone beyond the needs of informing the public, especially by unlawfully retaining original copies of secret documents the possession of which was in itself a crime and in exposing the AIVD’s use of informants. Moreover, adequate safeguards existed in the form of the Supervisory Board for Intelligence and Security Services ( Commissie van toezicht voor de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten, hereafter “Supervisory Board”), two of whose members including the chairman were members of the judiciary; the Supervisory Board exercised supervision on a regular basis but also entertained complaints, and in so doing had access to information denied the civil courts.

The other defence submitted by De Telegraaf and the other appellants, that the AIVD could have awaited the outcome of the criminal investigation was rejected by the Court of Appeal by pointing out that the criminal investigation and the investigation by the AIVD are entirely unrelated to each other, by which the Court of Appeal meant to express that the two investigations pursue different aims and serve different interests, so that in order to answer the question whether the use of the special powers meets the requirement of subsidiarity the outcome of the criminal investigation is, in principle, irrelevant. ...”",

                "“[Section 9(1) of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act] provides that public servants of the AIVD do not have the power to conduct a criminal investigation. The AIVD is therefore not entitled to employ any special powers with the aim of a criminal investigation. The intelligence service may only use these powers within the context of its own tasks. The areas of attention of the police and the [Public Prosecution Service] on the one hand and of the AIVD on the other hand, are sometimes in line with one another. The investigative services and the AIVD however each have their own approach towards their investigations, they operate from different perspectives. A criminal investigation is aimed at obtaining evidence on behalf of criminal proceedings. An investigation of the AIVD is on the other hand aimed at timely informing the authorities that are competent to act on any threats against the democratic legal system or threats to the security or other vital interests of the state with the purpose of preventing the harming of these interests. In the case of the leaked state secrets, a story covered by De Telegraaf, it is the investigative services’ task to collect information about the question who stole the state secrets at the BVD and which unauthorised third parties keep or kept possession of the leaked material. The investigation by the AIVD has a different focus, owing to the fact that the AIVD investigates to what extent the integrity and effective functioning of the AIVD have been, and possibly still are being, harmed. In case of a leak of this extent it is, moreover, necessary to find out if possibly more documents have been leaked and where these are, in order to identify the damage for current operational investigations and the danger to human sources and staff of the AIVD. Although the AIVD investigation is not aimed at collecting evidence for criminal proceedings, in performing its task the AIVD may come across information that may also be important for the criminal investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. In that case the AIVD based on [section 38 of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act] has the possibility to make available the information to the [Public Prosecution Service] via an official message to the National Public Prosecutor for Counter-terrorism. In the investigation in hand several official messages were issued to the [Public Prosecution Service].”"

The tapping of the telephone of one non-target was not in keeping with the requirement of subsidiarity, and transcriptions had been made of various intercepted telephone conversations that were unrelated to the case and were also of no relevance to the performance by the AIVD of its duties. The Supervisory Board also found some transcriptions of intercepted telephone conversations in cases where the Minister had not yet given consent for electronic surveillance. In addition, it discovered that two telephone numbers that had wrongly been attributed to a target of the AIVD had been tapped. The Supervisory Board concluded that despite these lapses the data that had been provided in the official reports had been lawfully obtained."

Within that framework it was considered necessary, among other things, to use special powers against the journalists of De Telegraaf who were in possession of the leaked file. The use of special powers was not intended directly to identify the journalists’ sources but did indirectly interfere with the journalistic right of source protection. The Supervisory Board has tested the lawfulness of the decisions concerned in the light of the applicable laws and delegated legislation and the above-mentioned requirements of necessity, proportionality and subsidiarity. In so doing the Board has taken into consideration all relevant aspects of the case, including in particular those mentioned above. The Board thus concluded that the decisions to use special powers against the journalists were lawful.”",

This includes the fact, among others, that journalists have lawfully had their telephones tapped. I did not wish to supply this information earlier in the summary injunction and appeal proceedings which have taken place with regard to the present AIVD investigation.

                "The leaking of classified AIVD information damages the integrity and functioning of that service and can in so doing endanger the national security for which the AIVD labours. The AIVD has therefore, in the opinion of the Board, rightly initiated an operational investigation within the meaning of section 6, paragraph 2, sub-paragraph a of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act.",

The Board is of the opinion that the way in which this was done should be considered an (implied) part of the complaint of De Telegraaf and the other complainants. After all, the complaint relates to the application of special powers. Such application includes, in the Board’s opinion, the transcription and recording of intercepted conversations. The Board finds that several of the journalists’ conversations have been transcribed and recorded which did not relate to the investigation into the leak within the AIVD and which have no further relevance to the AIVD’s discharge of its duties. Even on initial consideration this ought to have been clear in respect of a (major) portion of these too far-reaching transcriptions. The Board also finds that this information has not been destroyed after having been recorded and considered more closely.",

The special powers have thus not been used for the purpose of the criminal investigation. The Board therefore takes the view that there has been no adulteration of the AIVD investigation with the criminal investigation headed by the Public Prosecution Service. The issuing of official reports ( ambtsberichten ) in this case cannot lead to the finding that there has been adulteration of tasks and powers between the AIVD and the Public Prosecution Service. After all, this concerns the regular provision of information – which the AIVD has obtained based on its own tasks – to the Public Prosecution Service in accordance with the law in force.",

An implied part of the complaint, namely the transcription and recording of intercepted telephone conversations, I declare well-founded in part.",

An interference with the right freely to gather news – including the interest of protection of a journalistic source – can be justified under Article 10 § 2 in so far as the conditions set out in that provision have been complied with. That means in the first place that the interference must have a basis in national law and that those national legal rules must have a certain precision. Secondly, the interference must serve one of the aims mentioned in Article 10 § 2. Thirdly, the interference must be necessary in a democratic society for attaining such an aim. In this, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role. In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other, less far-reaching ways ( minder bezwarende wegen ) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree. Where it concerns a criminal investigation, it must be considered whether the interference with the right freely to gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth.

Court H.R., Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, para. 39). Journalists may receive their information from all kinds of sources. Therefore, a wide interpretation of this term is necessary. The actual provision of information to journalists can constitute an action on the side of the source, for example when a source calls or writes to a journalist or sends to him or her recorded information or pictures. Information shall also be regarded as being ‘provided’ when a source remains passive and consents to the journalist taking the information, such as the filming or recording of information with the consent of the source.”",

The law must be compatible with the rule of law, which means that it must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by Article 8 § 1 and Article 10 § 1.

Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Weber and Saravia, cited above, §§ 93-95 and 145; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v.

In Weber and Saravia, the interference with the applicants’ rights under Articles 8 and 10 consisted of the interception of telecommunications in order to identify and avert dangers in advance, or “strategic monitoring” as it is also called. The first applicant in that case being a journalist, the Court found that her right to protect her journalistic sources was in issue ( loc. cit., §§ 144-45). However, the aim of strategic monitoring was not to identify journalists’ sources. Generally the authorities would know only when examining the intercepted telecommunications, if at all, that a journalist’s conversation had been monitored. Surveillance measures were, in particular, not directed at uncovering journalistic sources. The interference with freedom of expression by means of strategic monitoring could not, therefore, be characterised as particularly serious ( loc. cit., § 151). Although admittedly there was no special provision for the protection of freedom of the press and, in particular, the non-disclosure of sources once the authorities had become aware that they had intercepted a journalist’s conversation, the safeguards in place, which had been found to satisfy the requirements of Article 8, were considered adequate and effective for keeping the disclosure of journalistic sources to an unavoidable minimum ( loc. cit., § 151)."

Germany, 6 September 1978, § 56, Series A no. 28, and Kennedy, cited above, § 167). However, in both cases the Court was prepared to accept as adequate the independent supervision available. In Klass and Others, this included a practice of seeking prior consent to surveillance measures of the G 10 Commission, an independent body chaired by a president who was qualified to hold judicial office and which moreover had the power to order the immediate termination of the measures in question ( mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others, §§ 21 and 51; see also Weber and Saravia, §§ 25 and 117). In Kennedy ( loc. cit. ) the Court was impressed by the interplay between the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (“IPT”), an independent body composed of persons who held or had held high judicial office and experienced lawyers which had the power, among other things, to quash interception orders, and the Interception of Communications Commissioner, likewise a functionary who held or had held high judicial office ( Kennedy, § 57) and who had access to all interception warrants and applications for interception warrants ( Kennedy, § 56)."

Judicial review post factum could not cure these failings, since it could not prevent the disclosure of the identity of the journalistic sources from the moment when this information came into the hands of the public prosecutor and the police ( loc. cit., §§ 96-99)."

                "127. Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom, as is recognised and reflected in various international instruments including the Committee of Ministers Recommendation quoted in paragraph 61 above. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected. Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom, such a measure cannot be compatible with Article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest (see Goodwin, cited above, § 39; Voskuil, cited above, § 65; Financial Times Ltd. and Others, cited above, § 59; and Sanoma, cited above, § 51)."

While it may be true that the public perception of the principle of non-disclosure of sources would suffer no real damage where it was overridden in circumstances where a source was clearly acting in bad faith with a harmful purpose (for example, by intentionally fabricating false information), courts should be slow to assume, in the absence of compelling evidence, that these factors are present in any particular case. In any event, given the multiple interests in play, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source can never be decisive in determining whether a disclosure order ought to be made but will merely operate as one, albeit important, factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article 10 § 2 ( Financial Times Ltd. and Others, cited above, § 63)."

Turning to the facts of the case, the Court notes that before the Regional Court the public prosecutor stated that the primary purpose of the surrender order was to return them to the AIVD, although if the opportunity arose to examine them for usable traces it would be taken. However, as the public prosecutor admitted, even without detailed technical examination of the documents the culprits could be found simply by studying the contents of the documents and identifying the officials who had had access to them (see paragraph 22 above). That being so, the need to identify the AIVD official concerned cannot alone justify the surrender order."

Although the full contents of the documents had not come to the knowledge of the general public, it is highly likely that that information had long been circulating outside the AIVD and had come to the knowledge of persons described by the parties as criminals. Withdrawing the documents from circulation could therefore no longer prevent the information which they contained – including the code names and other information identifying AIVD informants – from falling into the wrong hands (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, § 54, Series Ano. 217; Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 68, Series A no. 216; and Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the Netherlands, 9 February 1995, § 45, Series A no. 306 ‑ A)."

However, that is not sufficient to find that it constituted “an overriding requirement in the public interest” justifying the disclosure of the applicant’s journalistic source. The Court takes the view that the actual handover of the documents taken was not necessary: since – as appears from the Minister’s letter of 20 December 2006 to the Lower House (see paragraph 18 above) – these were copies not originals, visual inspection to verify that they were complete, followed by their destruction (as was in fact proposed by the first applicant, see paragraph 22 above), would have sufficed."

Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

A defendant, X, was charged with various counts of tax fraud and aggravated fraud for allegedly deceiving the Social Insurance Institution ( kansaneläkelaitos, folkpensionsanstalten ) and insurance companies. The article was published in issue no. 6/ 19 97 of the magazine Alibi, and entitled: “It seemed legal, but... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks?” ( In Finnish: Näytti lailliselta, mutta ... yrittäjärouva huijasi yli 2 miljoonan eläkkeen? ). The article did not mention X ’ s name. In the magazine ’ s table of contents, however, her first name was mentioned. The article included a reproduction of an article which had been published eight years previously with two photographs of X. That article, written by the first applicant, had been published in another magazine and mentioned X ’ s full name and included two photographs of her, one taken inside her home and another in her garden. The article was about a house purchased by the applicant which turned out to be full of rising damp. This situation naturally made her extremely miserable as she had spent her money on an uninhabitable house."

The case thus amounted to defamation, as set out in Chapter 27 of the Penal Code ( rikoslaki, strafflagen ). The court found that other parts of the article were not defamatory.

According to the travaux préparatoires, such domains are first and foremost the attendance to a public office or function, business life and political activity.

The acts mentioned in the charge related to [X ’ s] actions as an entrepreneur in a relatively small cleaning firm. Although the criminal case concerned substantial financial benefits, it was not a case which, viewed on its own, was of such general public interest that there would have been grounds to reproduce, as part of an article and without [X ’ s] consent, another article that included her name and photograph. Although the underlying purpose of the article might have been to draw attention to the abuse of social benefits in general by using an individual case and thus to a negative social phenomenon, it was not necessary or justified to publish without authorisation an illustration revealing the identity of an individual private person charged with or convicted of such an offence and in a similar position to [X].",

Thus, it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence. The fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure, before publishing the information again, that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it. The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff ’ s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant ’ s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant ’ s name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant ’ s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult. By again reporting on the matter two months after the events had occurred, the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid."

The gravity of the crime is also an obvious relevant factor. The central question is who is a public figure. There have been cases where spouses, girlfriends or boyfriends of public figures have argued that they were not, and won their case in court. Recently following a school massacre the Minister of the Interior disclosed the name of the killer in a live televised press conference, a few hours after the incident. The police also recently published the name and picture of a man accused of (and later convicted of) spreading HIV, as well as the names and pictures of two escaped convicts.

A public debate had taken place, in which those judgments had been criticised. Furthermore, in December 2005 the Supreme Court had decided a case ( no. 2005:136; see paragraph 31 above ) which concerned another article published in the Alibi magazine. In that case, the majority of the Supreme Court judges had taken the view that the magazine had been entitled to publish the name of a convicted criminal. The incompatibility of that Supreme Court judgment with its judgment in the present case was, in itself, sufficient reason to find a violation. The applicants also observed that it was difficult for the Finnish media to report on legal proceedings because the domestic courts ’ decisions had made it difficult to predict when disclosure of the identity of a defendant or convicted person was within the sphere of freedom of expression and the public nature of legal proceedings and when, in contrast, disclosure constituted a criminal offence giving rise to a liability to pay damages. In the present case the Supreme Court had not even mentioned the Convention or Article 10 thereof. The names of accused and convicted persons were published daily in the Finnish media. There were no legal provisions defining when a defendant ’ s identity could be revealed. In the present case, the applicant ’ s actions had complied with the Guidelines for Journalists and no complaints had been lodged with the Mass Media Council ( julkisen sanan neuvosto, opinionsnämnden för massmedier )."

The District Court had held at least nine hearings before the impugned article was published. The applicants were surprised that neither the Government nor the Supreme Court had mentioned the principle of the public nature of legal proceedings, given that the case related exclusively to the disclosure of the identity of a defendant in such proceedings. Finnish legislation contained no provision which required the accused person ’ s consent prior to publication of his or her name or picture. At the relevant time the Constitution Act had not included a separate provision on the protection of privacy. The defendant ’ s identity in a trial had never before been considered as belonging to a person ’ s private life within the meaning of Chapter 27, Article 3a, of the Penal Code, and this principle still applied to public legal proceedings. For example, in its decision no. 2005:136 the Supreme Court majority had reached the opposite conclusion with regard to the publication of a convicted person ’ s name, ruling that “a criminal offence is not the private matter of the individual who committed the offence”. In the applicants ’ view, the Government defined the concept of private life too broadly when they claimed that information was part of private life unless specifically found otherwise. This claim contradicted the provisions of the Public Nature of Court Proceedings Act."

                "45. The provision on invasion of privacy required that, in order to constitute a criminal offence, the publication of the information had to be unlawful and intentional and had to relate to a person ’ s private life. The impugned article met none of these criteria. Firstly, the publication of public information, namely a person ’ s identity, was a legal right. Secondly, being accused of an offence in legal proceedings was not part of a person ’ s private life. Thirdly, the requirement of intent in criminal law was not met when a reporter had no idea that the disclosure of a defendant ’ s identity could constitute a criminal offence. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the present case was probably the first in Finnish history in which the opposite view had been upheld. The appellate court had found, in accordance with legal precedent until the present case, that reporting on charges which were the subject of public legal proceedings was legitimate, even though the information published could cause anguish to the defendant. The Guidelines for Journalists did not meet the “prescribed by law” requirement since they could not be applied when deciding whether an act constituted a criminal offence. The applicants did not deny the ethical demands placed upon the profession by the Guidelines. They observed that, despite their legal rights, they had sought to protect X ’ s identity in the article by crossing out her surname and her picture, but because of a printer ’ s error, her face and surname had been shown."

There was no pressing social need to depart from the established practice and regulations. In a democratic State, legal proceedings were public and a defendant ’ s identity was public information; this also served to ensure the legal protection of defendants. The question of whether the disclosure of X ’ s identity had been necessary for the purpose of dealing with a socially important matter was irrelevant, since the provisions on the public nature of legal proceedings were not associated with matters of social significance. In any event, the proceedings against X had significance for society. Offences of tax and accounting fraud did not belong to private life, and fraud concerning a disability pension amounting to almost FIM 2.5 million was a major offence. X had ultimately received a heavy sentence. The criminal charges against X had been significant enough to justify the publication of her name."

                "58. As to whether the interference was “ prescribed by law ”, the applicants argued that the names of accused persons were published daily in the Finnish media and that they had not therefore been able to foresee that the publication of X ’ s name and photograph would render them liable in damages. The Government argued that the publication of names had never been usual in Finland in news reports on offences and that it had not been considered consistent with good journalistic practice to publish names of suspects or accused persons. The Court does not discern any ambiguity as to the contents of the relevant provision of the Penal Code (the spreading of information, an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as invasion of privacy; see paragraph 22 above ). Nor was Chapter 5, section 6, of the Tort Liability Act unclear (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard also to the domestic case-law on the subject, the possibility that a sanction would be imposed was not unforeseeable. The position taken in the Supreme Court ’ s subsequent decision of 2005 does not detract from this position as the circumstances of that case concerning the conviction of a person of violent crime degrading the victim ’ s human dignity (see paragraph 3 1 above) were significantly different. The Court therefore concludes that the interference was thus “prescribed by law” (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 34, 16 November 2004 and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ X).

In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v.

Austria, no. 34315/96, §§ 33 et seq., 26 February 2002). The Court thus found, in one case, that the use of certain terms in relation to an individual ’ s private life was not “ justified by considerations of public concern ” and that those terms did not “[bear] on a matter of general importance” (see Tammer, cited above, § 68) and went on to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 10. In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of “major public concern” and that the published photographs “did not disclose any details of [the] private life” of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 37) and held that there had been a violation of Article 10. Similarly, in a case concerning the publication by President Mitterrand ’ s former private doctor of a book containing revelations about the President ’ s state of health, the Court held that “the more time that elapsed, the more the public interest in discussion of the history of President Mitterrand ’ s two terms of office prevailed over the requirements of protecting the President ’ s rights with regard to medical confidentiality” (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004-IV) and held that there had been a breach of Article 10."

While reporting and commenting on court proceedings, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public, it is to be noted that the public nature of court proceedings does not function as a carte blanche relieving the media of their duty to show due care in communicating information received in the course of those proceedings (see Council of Europe Recommendation No. Rec (2003)13 on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings; paragraphs 34 and 35 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Finnish Guidelines for Journalists, as in force at the relevant time, stated that the publication of a name and other identifying information in this context was justified only if a significant public interest was involved (see paragraph 32 above)."

                "64. The Court observes at the outset that the 1997 article recounted the facts of a criminal case pending before the District Court in which X was a defendant. The pictures of X were accompanied by a question (see paragraph 8 above) : “ It seemed legal, but ... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks? ” Reading the 1997 article as a whole, the Court cannot find that this statement was excessive or misleading as it was clearly phrased as a question. Furthermore, it is of importance that the depicted events and quotations in the article were taken from the public prosecutor ’ s bill of indictment, which had become a public document the moment it was received by the District Court. In this case it is not in dispute that the reporting on the criminal case was based on facts. The article stated that charges had been brought against X and that the case was pending before the District Court."

                "65. There was no connection between the earlier article and the 1997 article other than the fact that they were about the same person. The situation described in the earlier article did not come within the sphere of any public debate. That being said, in the earlier article the applicant had willingly shared with the readers her personal experiences and had consented in this connection to having her photograph published. The 1997 article must be considered to have reproduced an article which was irrelevant to the subject under discussion, giving X ’ s name and picture, which were thereby expressly communicated to the general public. It is however not for this Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists ( see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298 ). For the sake of clarity, it is not the initial publication of that article which is before the Court but its use as an illustration in the 1997 article."

            [
                "66. The Court can accept that the purpose of the 1997 article was to contribute to a public discussion. The criminal case brought against X was selected as an example illustrating the problems involved. While it is perfectly legitimate to use individual cases to highlight a more general problem, the question is whether the applicants went too far when they communicated X ’ s identity to the public. It is plain that X was not a public figure or a politician but an ordinary person who was the subject of criminal proceedings (see Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, § 32, Series A no. 242 ‑ B ). The fact that she ran a relatively small cleaning firm and had given an interview eight years previously to a magazine, which had come about in circumstances apparently not discussed during the domestic proceedings or at any length before the Court, does not mean that she had knowingly entered the public arena (see, mutatis mutandis, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 75, Series A no. 294 ‑ B ). X ’ s status as an ordinary person enlarges the zone of interaction which may fall within the scope of private life. The fact that she was the subject of criminal proceedings cannot remove from her the protection of Article 8 (see Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, § 28-29, ECHR 2005 ‑ I )."

In order to assess whether the “necessity” of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression has been established convincingly, the Court must examine the issue essentially from the standpoint of the relevancy and sufficiency of the reasons given by the Supreme Court for requiring the applicants to pay compensation to X. The Court must determine whether the applicants ’ liability in damages struck a fair balance between the public interest involved and X ’ s interests and whether the standards applied were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (see Nikula v.

The publication of a photograph must, in the Court ’ s view, in general be considered a more substantial interference with the right to respect for private life than the mere communication of the person ’ s name. As the Court has held, although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photos, this is an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance (see Von Hannover, no. 59320/00, §§ 50-53 and 59, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI ).

Although all four of the applicants were convicted as charged and each was sentenced to three years and six months'imprisonment, following recent amendments in the criminal law system the proceedings were reopened and are still pending in respect of two of the applicants, Mr Ercan Gül and Mr Erkan Arslanbenzer. As a result, although there is no final conviction in respect of two of the applicants, having regard to the fact that all of the applicants were found guilty under Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and that the criminal proceedings which were initially commenced in 1999 have not yet been terminated, there has been an interference with the applicants'right to freedom of expression. The Court further notes that the interference was prescribed by law, namely Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and Section 7 § 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act on disseminating the propaganda of an illegal, armed organisation through incitement to use violent methods. As to the legitimacy of the aims pursued, the Court observes that the authorities sought to protect national security and public order.

Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that these are well-known, stereotyped leftist slogans and that they were shouted during lawful demonstrations – which limited their potential impact on “national security” and “public order” – they cannot be interpreted as a call for violence or an uprising. The Court stresses, however, that whilst this assessment should not be taken as an approval of the tone of these slogans, it must be recalled that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, Karataş v. Turkey [GC], no. 23168/94, § 49, ECHR 19 99 ‑ IV). The Court also reiterates that, according to its well-established case-law, paragraph 2 of Article 10, is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” which are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see, Sürek and Özdemir v.

In that connection, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with freedom of expression (see Yarar v.

Her family members living at the address of her registered residence denied having that information when questioned on 5 February 2011. It is unclear how the police could have been more efficient in their attempts to reach her by email or through her university contacts. Even less convincing is the applicant ’ s suggestion that she could have been directly contacted as the author of the video on the Internet, given that her identity had first to be established through investigation (see, for example, paragraph 14 above ). The Court also has doubts as regards the applicant ’ s submission that she had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against her until her arrest on 29 March 2011.

Switzerland ([GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, 29 March 2016). Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence the obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression. Artists and those who promote their work are certainly not immune from the possibility of limitations as provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 10.

Defamatory and other types of clearly unlawful speech, including hate speech and speech inciting violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online. Bearing in mind the need to protect the values underlying the Convention, and considering that the rights under Articles 10 and 8 of the Convention deserve equal respect, a balance must be struck that retains the essence of both rights. Thus, while the Court acknowledges that important benefits can be derived from the Internet in the exercise of freedom of expression, it is also mindful that liability for defamatory or other types of unlawful speech must, in principle, be retained and constitute an effective remedy for violations of personality rights ( see Delfi AS, cited above, § 110)."

The Court of Appeal confirmed the Regional Court ’ s assessment that the text in the leaflet implied that the plaintiffs performed unlawful actions. This was not called into question by the further explanations, as the average reader could not be expected to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under Article 218a § 2 of the Criminal Code and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under Article 218a § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 2 6 below ).

However, in the instant case the applicant had created a massive “pillory effect” by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. The performance of abortions was criticised with harsh and rigid words. This was further aggravated by the Holocaust reference.

Furthermore, it underlined that the applicant had only blamed the doctor for having carried out allegedly immoral acts, but had not reproached him for having committed acts which were subject to criminal liability or forbidden by law in a wider sense. The Federal Constitutional Court moreover insisted on the fact that the applicant had contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest and pointed out that, against the factual background of that case, the courts had not sufficiently clarified why and to what extent the special relationship between the doctor and women searching for counselling and medical treatment in the practice might have been jeopardised.",

The fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is “necessary in a democratic society” are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have recently been summarised as follows (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 131, 1 6 June 2015 with further references):",
                "“(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"
            ],
            [
                "53. Another principle that has consistently emphasised in the Court ’ s case-law is that there is little scope under Article 10 of the Convention for restrictions on political expressions or on debate on questions of public interest (see, among other authorities, Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV; and Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 102, ECHR 2013 (extracts))."

It follows that the applicant ’ s statement that “unlawful abortions” had been performed was correct from a judicial point of view (see Annen v. Germany (dec.), nos. 2373/07 and 2396/07, 30 March 2010)."

The Court moreover considers that – although the leaflet ’ s layout was clearly designed to draw the reader ’ s attention to the first sentence set in bold letters – the very wording of the applicant ’ s further explanation, according to which the abortions were not subject to criminal liability, was sufficiently clear, even from a layperson ’ s perspective. Although the assessment and interpretation of the factual background of a case is primarily a matter for the domestic courts, the Court, in the particular circumstances of the present case and also bearing in mind the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 8 June 2010 (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above) dealing with almost identical questions, is convinced that the mere fact that the additional explanation had not been visually highlighted does not imply that a reasonable person with ordinary awareness would assume that the abortions were performed outside the legal conditions and were forbidden in a stricter sense of criminal liability. With regard to the impact of the additional explanation, the Court also reiterates that it was directly attached to the first part of the applicant ’ s statement and thus immediately accessible to the reader. Therefore, the facts of the present case have to be distinguished from those underlying the applicant ’ s prior applications which the Court found to be manifestly ill-founded (see Annen v. Germany (dec.), nos. 2373/07 and 2396/07, cited above, and Annen v. Germany (dec.), no. 55558/1 0, 12 February 2013).

While the Court furthermore accepts the domestic courts ’ position, according to which the applicant ’ s campaign had been directly aimed at the two doctors, it also notes that the applicant ’ s choice of presenting his arguments in a personalised manner, by disseminating leaflets indicating the doctors ’ names and professional address in the immediate vicinity of the day clinic, enhanced the effectiveness of his campaign. The Court also points out that the applicant ’ s campaign contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest. There can be no doubt as to the acute sensitivity of the moral and ethical issues raised by the question of abortion or as to the importance of the public interest at stake (see A, B and C v. Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, § 233, ECHR 2010). Although the Government pointed out that the doctors, as a consequence of negative public attention, had closed the day clinic and had built up another professional practice, it is not clear from their allegations whether the applicant ’ s activities actually caused this development. In this respect, the Court further notes that the doctors did not lodge a claim for compensation with the civil courts due to the negative impact on their business."

As to the applicant ’ s reference to the Auschwitz concentration camps and the Holocaust, the Court reiterates that the impact an expression of opinion has on another person ’ s personality rights cannot be detached from the historical and social context in which the statement was made. The reference to the Holocaust must also be seen in the specific context of German history (see Hoffer and Annen v. Germany, nos. 397/07 and 2322/07, § 48, 13 January 2011, and PETA Deutschland v. Germany, no. 43481/09, § 49, 8 November 2012). However, given the very wording of the leaflet, the Court cannot agree with the domestic courts ’ interpretation that the applicant had compared the doctors and their professional activities to the Nazi regime. In fact, the applicant ’ s statement according to which the killing of human beings in Auschwitz had been unlawful, but allowed, and had not been subject to criminal liability under the Nazi regime, may also be understood as a way of creating awareness of the more general fact that law may diverge from morality. Although the Court is aware of the subtext of the applicant ’ s statement, which was further intensified by the reference to the webpage “www.babycaust. de”, it observes that the applicant did not – at least not explicitly – equate abortion with the Holocaust. Thus, the Court is not convinced that the prohibition of disseminating the leaflets was justified by a violation of the doctors ’ personality rights due to the Holocaust reference alone."

It is important to note that in his first publication of 3 September 2002 the applicant outlined the violent incident at the summer camp in general terms without naming its participants or describing them in an identifiable manner. It was only in his second publication of 17 September 2002 that the applicant mentioned the names of the juvenile offenders, including the name of Mr V.'s stepgrandson, and the official positions of their relatives. However, before that date that information had already been disclosed by another newspaper and the incident in all its details had been widely discussed in the press and on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). It has not been submitted in the domestic proceeding or before the Court that the applicant's publications introduced any new personal details previously unknown to the public. It follows that by the time of the second publication the offenders'personal information had ceased to be confidential and was already in the public domain. Thus, the interest in protecting the identity of the juvenile offenders and their relatives had been substantially diminished, so that the preservation of confidentiality in this matter could no longer constitute an overriding requirement (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; Sürek v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], no. 24122/94, § 40, 8 July 1999, and, mutatis mutandis, Weber v.

That being said, the Court considers that in certain circumstances a restriction on reproducing information that has already entered the public domain may be justified, for example to prevent further airing of the details of an individual's private life which do not come within the scope of any political or public debate on a matter of general importance. The Court reiterates in this connection that in cases of publications relating the details of an individual's private life with the sole purpose of satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership, the individual's right to the effective protection of his or her private life prevails over the journalist's freedom of expression (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 65, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI; Campmany y Diez de Revenga and López Galiacho Perona v. Spain (dec.), no. 54224/00, ECHR 2000-XII; Société Prisma Presse v.

It is hard because the guilt and its extent should be determined by a court, but the underage participants in this story are, alas, not liable to prosecution ... Their parents should be responsible for their deeds vis-à-vis society and the State. This is why we have decided to take the matter up ...",

I will say only one thing: the circumstances of those unchildlish deeds were established by evidence. They amount to assault and battery, punishable by Article 116, and sexual assault, punishable by Article 132 of [the Criminal Code]. Thus, if those moral freaks had been charged with criminal offences and committed for trial, they would have risked long terms of imprisonment.",

[After the parents of the victim had complained to the police,] an investigation was conducted by officers from the Interior Department of the Teykovskiy District, who established that the actions of the three minor rapists indeed disclosed all the elements of criminal offences. However, no criminal proceedings were opened because the suspects were minors. Meanwhile, the press learned about the events and a scandal erupted.",

However, as a rule, such cases are abandoned at an early stage of the inquiry. Even when they are referred for trial, the general public hardly ever knows about it. Without any doubt, had the administration of the Stroitel summer camp paid attention to the facts and warned the parents in time, the investigators from [the Interior Department of the Teykovskiy District] would have hardly been allowed to go on with the investigation. The events were, however, left to take their course and were made public.",

Perhaps they thought that the judge and the Law were one and the same thing, that the judge was not servant but master of the law, a superhuman? And that his children were superhumans, too; they could do whatever they pleased, in the knowledge that their mothers and fathers would exempt them from liability ...",

What is more, while our editorial board was working on that publication, we received a number of bizarre telephone calls asking us to stop the journalistic investigation and stay out of the way of the judges and their children. It is strange that none of the'well-wishers'who called us considered the fate of the injured child, of how he will live after what happened. Nor did they consider the fate of the underage members of the'criminal trio'. What will become of them?

On 24 February 2005 the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted Resolution no. 3, which required the courts examining defamation claims to distinguish between statements of facts which can be checked for veracity, and value judgments, opinions and convictions which are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code because they are expressions of a defendant's subjective opinion and views and cannot be checked for veracity (paragraph 9). Furthermore, it prohibited the courts from ordering defendants to extend an apology to a claimant, because that form of redress had no basis under Russian law, including Article 152 of the Civil Code (paragraph 18).",

That statement had been a supposition rather than a statement of fact. It had not been amenable to proof.

Moreover, the applicant had not in fact disclosed any confidential information about the claimants'private lives.

The courts had drawn a distinction between value judgments and statements of fact and had held the applicant liable only in respect of the statements of fact that he had been unable to prove. The applicant had also been held liable for disseminating information about the claimants'private lives without their explicit consent. The applicant had been ordered to pay a purely symbolic amount of compensation to the claimants.

According to the Court's well-established case-law, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v.

Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 59, ECHR 1999-III). Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, § 63, Series A no. 239). Journalistic freedom covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313 ). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2, which must, however, be construed strictly. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly."

Article 10 of the Convention protects journalists'right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, freedom of expression carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern. Moreover, these “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the “rights of others”. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 67, ECHR 2007 ‑ ..., and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 78, ECHR 2004-XI)."

Although it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do, civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III). Further, as regards criticism directed against judges, the Court has found that the work of the courts, which are the guarantors of justice and which have a fundamental role in a State governed by the rule of law, needs to enjoy public confidence. It should therefore be protected against unfounded attacks. The courts are however not immune from criticism and scrutiny. It is important that a clear distinction is made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court, or members of that court, an appropriate punishment would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see Skałka v.

As regards the applicant's argument that the judicial order to extend an apology had no legal basis in domestic law, the Court has already found that at the material time, that is, before the adoption in 2005 of Resolution no. 3 by the Plenary Supreme Court (see paragraph 32 above), the domestic courts reasonably interpreted the notion of retraction as possibly including an apology. The Court has accepted that that interpretation of the relevant legislation by the Russian courts was not such as to render the impugned interference unlawful in Convention terms (see Kazakov v. Russia, no. 1758/02, § § 21-24, 18 December 2008 ). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Accordingly, it remains to be examined whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The Court reiterates that the test of “ necessity in a democratic society ” requires it to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This margin of appreciation is not, however, unlimited, but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Krasulya v. Russia, no. 12365/03, § 34, 22 February 2007, and Grinberg v. Russia, no. 23472/03, § 27, 21 July 2005)."

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant, a journalist at a local newspaper, published two articles about a violent incident at a summer camp where minor children of high-ranking officials had assaulted their younger roommate. It is significant that the domestic courts found that all the information published about the assault was based on the results of the official investigation and was accordingly true. They nevertheless found the applicant liable for disclosing private information about the offenders and their relatives and for disseminating a statement, which he had been unable to prove, to the effect that the offenders'relatives had attempted to interfere with the investigation. The Court will examine those two aspects in turn."

As to the first aspect, the Court observes that the applicant was found civilly liable for disclosing information about the private life of Mr V., a high-ranking traffic police official.

            ],
            [
                "49. It is important to note that in his first publication of 3 September 2002 the applicant outlined the violent incident at the summer camp in general terms without naming its participants or describing them in an identifiable manner. It was only in his second publication of 17 September 2002 that the applicant mentioned the names of the juvenile offenders, including the name of Mr V.'s stepgrandson, and the official positions of their relatives. However, before that date that information had already been disclosed by another newspaper and the incident in all its details had been widely discussed in the press and on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). It has not been submitted in the domestic proceeding or before the Court that the applicant's publications introduced any new personal details previously unknown to the public. It follows that by the time of the second publication the offenders'personal information had ceased to be confidential and was already in the public domain. Thus, the interest in protecting the identity of the juvenile offenders and their relatives had been substantially diminished, so that the preservation of confidentiality in this matter could no longer constitute an overriding requirement (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; Sürek v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], no. 24122/94, § 40, 8 July 1999, and, mutatis mutandis, Weber v.

That being said, the Court considers that in certain circumstances a restriction on reproducing information that has already entered the public domain may be justified, for example to prevent further airing of the details of an individual's private life which do not come within the scope of any political or public debate on a matter of general importance. The Court reiterates in this connection that in cases of publications relating the details of an individual's private life with the sole purpose of satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership, the individual's right to the effective protection of his or her private life prevails over the journalist's freedom of expression (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 65, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI; Campmany y Diez de Revenga and López Galiacho Perona v. Spain (dec.), no. 54224/00, ECHR 2000-XII; Société Prisma Presse v.

The Court must therefore determine whether the articles authored by the applicant made a contribution to a debate of general interest to society."

            [
                "51. The Court considers that information about the involvement of Mr V.'s minor stepgrandson in a violent incident made no such contribution. The public did not have a legitimate interest in knowing about Mr V.'s family affairs, which were not in any way related to his official functions. The Court reiterates that it is unacceptable that an official should be exposed to opprobrium because of matters concerning a member of his family (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I ). It is also of significance that Mr V.'s stepgrandson was a minor, and for that reason his deeds were not prosecutable under Russian law. He was never charged with a criminal offence and no criminal proceedings were opened against him. The instant case is therefore distinguishable from those cases in which journalists have reported on ongoing criminal proceedings, thereby exercising their right and duty to impart information on a matter of public concern (see, for example, News Verlags GmbH & Co.KG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, § § 55 and 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ I ). In the Court's view, in cases such as the present one where an offence has been committed by a minor who has not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility and who is not considered responsible for his actions, a journalist's right to impart information on a serious criminal offence must yield to the minor's right to the effective protection of his private life. There can be little doubt that his repeated naming in the press in connection with the reprehensible summer camp incident was particularly harmful to Mr V.'s stepgrandson's moral and psychological development and to his private life."

The Court concludes from the above that publication by the applicant of the names of the juvenile offenders and the official positions of their relatives did not make any contribution to a discussion of a matter of legitimate public concern. Although that information had been previously published by other newspapers, the civil liability imposed on the applicant was justified in the circumstances by the need to prevent further airing in the press of the details of the claimants'private lives."

As to the second aspect of the case against the applicant, the Court notes that he was found liable for disseminating the statement that “[ Mr and Mrs B. and Mr V. had ] attempted to interfere with the investigation”. The Court notes that that wording was not actually contained in the articles authored by the applicant. The article of 17 September 2002, however, mentioned that “attempts are being made to exert pressure on the course of the resumed investigation”. It is true that that statement is impersonal and the individuals who allegedly exercised such pressure are not referred to by name. However, when read in context, in particular in conjunction with such statements as “high-ranking parents of minor rapists seek to hush up the scandal”, that statement might convey to an ordinary reader the impression that it had been the claimants, Mr and Mrs B and Mr V., who had made the attempts to influence the investigation referred to in the article. The Court therefore accepts the finding of the domestic courts that the applicant had disseminated a statement accusing the claimants of interfering with the investigation."

The Court agrees that the applicant published a serious factual allegation against the claimants and that that allegation was susceptible of proof. The applicant, however, never endeavoured to prove that allegation or establish a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis for it. It follows that the applicant disseminated a defamatory accusation against the judges Mr and Mrs B. and the traffic police officer Mr V., which was likely to lower them in public esteem and was put forward without any supporting evidence (see Barfod v.

To reach this objective it is not necessary to use statements that insult the person in question and for this reason exceed the boundaries of acceptable criticism.

To cover by this principle a statement that was not a charge against this person, but an expression of contempt and disrespect, would be against the [law].

As regards the reasons given by the domestic courts, the Court firstly notes that when acquitting the applicant of the charge of defamation the court considered that his statements were within the limits of acceptable criticism of a politician in the context of political debate (see paragraph 13 above). For instance, the domestic courts acknowledged that his allegations that the politician, as mayor of the commune, was incompetent, had a sufficient factual basis. However, when establishing that the applicant had insulted the politician by stating that he was crawling up to another level of incompetence, the domestic courts failed to take into consideration that the impugned statement was a value judgment on a matter of public interest. The domestic court adopted a narrow definition of what could be considered acceptable criticism, excluding from it all statements expressing “contempt and disrespect” (see paragraph 16 above). In doing so the court did not take into consideration the fact that the impugned statements had been made in the context of a heated political debate. Moreover, it failed to notice that the applicant was exercising his right to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest and in so doing might have recourse to a degree of exaggeration. The statements in question were limited to an assessment of the professional sphere of the life of Mr A.W. and denounced his alleged lack of ability as a politician. The Court notes that although political invective often spills over into the personal sphere, in the instant case the applicant ’ s critical comment did not concern the private or family life of that politician (see a contrario Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, § 34, ECHR 2000-X, and Kulis, cited above, § 5 2 ).",

Lastly, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], cited above, § 64, and Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, § 78, ECHR 2004-VI). In that connection, it notes that while the penalty imposed on the applicant was relatively light (a payment of PLN 50 to a charity and reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings which amounted in total to PLN 518 – approximately 12 0 euros (EUR) at the material time ), and although the proceedings against him were conditionally discontinued, nevertheless the domestic courts found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of proffering insult. In consequence, the applicant had a criminal record. Moreover, it remained open to the courts to resume the proceedings at any time during the period of his probation should any of the circumstances defined by law so justify (see Dąbrowski v. Poland, no. 18235/02, § 36, 19 December 2006, and Weigt v Poland ( dec .), 74232/01, 11 October 2005 )."

                "46. Furthermore, while the penalty did not prevent the applicant from expressing himself, it nonetheless amounted to a kind of censorship which was likely to discourage him from making criticisms of that kind again in the future. Such a conviction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community. By the same token, it is liable to hamper the press in the performance of its task of purveyor of information and public watchdog (see, mutatis mutandis, Barthold v. Germany, judgment of 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90, p. 26, § 58, and Lingens v. Austria, cited above, p. 27, § 44). Indeed, the applicant submitted that because of the criminal proceedings instituted against him, he had abandoned his journalistic activity."

                "47. Finally, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings in the present case had their origin in a bill of indictment lodged by the politician himself and not by a public prosecutor (see, a contrario, Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, § 50, 20 April 2006) and that they resulted in conditional discontinuation of these proceedings. In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004 ‑ II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § 68, 14 February 2008). Nevertheless, the Court notes that when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists ’ freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 115, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4 October 2007)."

The SCRPA held that the advertisements “promot[ed] a lifestyle which [was] incompatible with the principles of a religious person” (see paragraph 18 above), without explaining what that lifestyle was and how the advertisements were promoting it, nor why a lifestyle which is “incompatible with the principles of a religious person” would necessarily be incompatible with public morals. The Court observes that even though all the domestic decisions referred to “religious people”, the only religious group which had been consulted in the domestic proceedings had been the Roman Catholic Church (see paragraph 16 above), despite the presence of various other Christian and non-Christian religious communities in Lithuania (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 56 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court of Lithuania has held that “no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual” and that the State “does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views” (see paragraph 45 above). It also draws attention to the position of the United Nations Human Rights Committee that limitations of rights for the purpose of protecting morals must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition (see paragraph 48 above)."

Referring to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Müller and Others v. Switzerland (24 May 1988, § 35, Series A no. 133) and Otto ‑ Preminger ‑ Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, § 50, Series A no. 295 ‑ A), it stated that it was not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that even within a single country such conceptions might vary; for that reason it was not possible to arrive at a comprehensive definition of what constituted a permissible interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression where such expression was directed against the religious feelings of others, and a certain margin of appreciation was therefore to be left to the national authorities in assessing the existence and extent of the necessity of such interference. The Supreme Administrative Court considered that the panel which had adopted the decision of 25 April 2014 had taken into account the fact that Catholicism was the religion of a very big part of the Lithuanian population and that the use of its most important symbols in the advertisements, which distorted their meaning, offended the feelings of religious people."

The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides for such a possibility. According to the Convention and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, such limitations are justified if ... they are lawful and ... necessary in a democratic society. The requirement of lawfulness means that the limitations have to be set only by means of a law that is publicly declared; the provisions of the law must be formulated clearly enough. When defining in law the limitations on individual rights, it is necessary to take account of the purpose and meaning of a corresponding right (or freedom) and the conditions of its limitation established in the Constitution. As to whether a concrete limitation is necessary in a democratic society, firstly, one must find out the aims of the limitation, and, secondly, find out whether the limitation is proportionate to the legitimate aim sought.",

Furthermore, the Roman Catholic Church had had a long-lasting historical presence in Lithuania, it had significantly influenced the social and cultural customs and traditions of the population, and had particularly contributed to the anti-Soviet resistance during the period of occupation and to the restoration of independence of Lithuania in 1990.

It argued that the Government ’ s submission that the moral choices of a large part of Lithuanian society were influenced by religion (see paragraph 56 above) had not been substantiated by any empirical evidence – to the contrary, one of the studies referred to by the Government had concluded that many Lithuanians considered themselves members of the Roman Catholic Church only in a “formal manner” and that religious tradition had limited impact on their lives. The applicant company submitted that approximately a hundred individuals who had complained about the advertisements (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above) could not be considered representative of the approximately 77% of the Lithuanian population who considered themselves Catholic; furthermore, the public reaction to the advertisements had not been uniform – several public figures and scholars had expressed their support to the advertisements and disappointment with the domestic court decisions. The applicant company thus argued that the small number of complaints had not been indicative of the overall sentiment of the population, and thus the interference with its right to freedom of expression could not be justified by the need to protect public morals.

That person must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Perinçek v.

In the present case, the impugned interference was based on Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising which prohibited advertising that “violates public morals” (see paragraph 34 above). The Court agrees with the Government that the concept of public morals is necessarily broad and subject to change over time, and as a result, a precise legal definition may not be possible (see paragraph 53 above). It considers that it would be unrealistic to expect the national legislature to enumerate an exhaustive list of actions which violate public morals (see, mutatis mutandis, Kudrevičius and Others v.

At the same time, the Court observes that the Government had acknowledged that not every use of religious symbols in advertising would violate public morals under Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising (see paragraph 53 above). It appears that the applicant company ’ s case was the first in which the domestic courts applied the concept of public morals to the use of religious symbols in advertising – the courts examining the case did not refer to any previous domestic case-law and nor did the parties provide any examples of such case-law to the Court (compare and contrast Müller and Others, cited above, § 29). The Court acknowledges that the very fact that the applicant company ’ s case was the first of its kind does not, as such, make the interpretation of the law unforeseeable, as there must come a day when a given legal norm is applied for the first time (see Kudrevičius and Others, §§ 114-15, and Perinçek, § 138, both cited above). Nonetheless, it has doubts as to whether the interpretation given by the domestic courts in the present case – namely, that the advertisements violated public morals because the use of religious symbols in them was “inappropriate” and “distorted the meaning” of those symbols (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) – could reasonably have been expected. The Court cannot stay blind to the fact that, while the applicant company ’ s case was still ongoing, the national authorities felt the need to amend the Law on Advertising in order to establish an explicit prohibition on advertising which expressed “contempt for religious symbols” (see paragraph 35 above). It takes note of the applicant company ’ s argument that such an amendment would not have been necessary had the prohibition of inappropriate use or contempt for religious symbols been established in Article 4 § 2 (1) with sufficient foreseeability (see paragraph 59 above)."

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016; and Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, § 124 )."

The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien Suisse, cited above, § 48; Morice v.

The Court observes that even though all the domestic decisions referred to “religious people”, the only religious group which had been consulted in the domestic proceedings had been the Roman Catholic Church (see paragraph 16 above), despite the presence of various other Christian and non-Christian religious communities in Lithuania (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 56 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court of Lithuania has held that “no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual” and that the State “does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views” (see paragraph 45 above).

It also reiterates that in a pluralist democratic society those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, § 47, and İ.A. v.

In the Court ’ s view, even though the advertisements had a commercial purpose and cannot be said to constitute “criticism” of religious ideas (see paragraph 76 above), the applicable principles are nonetheless similar (in this connection see in particular the findings of the domestic authorities that the advertisements “encourage[d] a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the Christian faith” in paragraph 18 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, it cannot be assumed that everyone who has indicated that he or she belongs to the Christian faith would necessarily consider the advertisements offensive, and the Government have not provided any evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless, even assuming that the majority of the Lithuanian population were indeed to find the advertisements offensive, the Court reiterates that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group ’ s rights to, inter alia, freedom of expression would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Barankevich v.

The Court notes that the fine imposed in the administrative proceedings was a penalty incurred by the applicant company in connection with the exercise of its freedom of expression and is directly related to the violation found in this case. Given the nature of the applicant company ’ s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way to repair the consequences of that violation would be to award the applicant company pecuniary damages. It therefore grants the applicant company ’ s claim in full and awards it EUR 580."
