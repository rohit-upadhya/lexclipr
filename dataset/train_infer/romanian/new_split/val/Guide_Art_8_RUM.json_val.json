His conviction was not the result of an unforeseeable application of that provision and the offence in question has no obvious bearing on the right to respect for “private life”. On the contrary, it concerns professional acts and omissions by public officials in the exercise of their duties. Nor has the applicant pointed to any concrete repercussions on his private life which were directly and causally linked to his conviction for that specific offence."

In the period between 1977 and 1992 a research project was carried out at the University of Gothenburg in the field of neuropsychiatry, focusing on cases of Attention ‑ Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD) or Deficits in Attention, Motor Control and Perception (DAMP) in children. The aim was to elucidate the significance thereof and associated problems from a long-term perspective. Parents to a group of one hundred and forty ‑ one pre ‑ school children volunteered to participate in the study, which was followed up every third year. Certain assurances were made to the children’s parents and later to the young people themselves concerning confidentiality. The research file, called the Gothenburg study, was voluminous and consisted of a large number of records, test results, interview replies, questionnaires and video and audio tapes. It contained a very large amount of privacy-sensitive data about the children and their relatives. Several doctoral theses have been based on the Gothenburg study. The material was stored by the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, of which the applicant was director. The project was originally set up and started by other researchers but the applicant subsequently took over responsibility for completing the study."

She had no interest in the personal data as such but only in the method used in the research and the evidence the researchers had for their conclusions. Her request was refused by the University of Gothenburg on 27 February 2002 because K had not shown any connection between the requested material and any research, and on the ground that the material contained data on individuals’ health status which, if disclosed, might harm an individual or persons related to that individual. An appeal against the decision was lodged with the Administrative Court of Appeal ( Kammarrätten i Göteborg ), which referred the matter to the University of Gothenburg to examine whether the material could be released after removal of identifying information or with a condition restricting K’s right to pass on or use the data. The University of Gothenburg again refused the request on 10 September 2002, on the ground that the data requested was subject to secrecy, that there was no possibility of releasing the material after removal of identifying information, nor was there sufficient evidence to conclude that the requested material could be released with conditions.

Thereafter, six conditions were set regarding K’s access, including that the data was only to be used within the Swedish Research Council funded research project called “The neurological paradigm: on the establishment of a new grand theory in Sweden” which K had specified before the Administrative Court of Appeal, that she was not allowed to remove copies from the premises where she was given access to the documents, and that transcripts of released documents containing data on psychological, medical or neurological examinations or treatment, or concerning the personal circumstances of individuals, and notes concerning such examinations, treatment or circumstances from a document released to her, would be destroyed when the above research project was completed and at the latest by 31 December 2004. Six similar conditions were also imposed on E, including that data in the released documents referring to psychological, medical, psychiatric or neurological examinations or treatment, and data in the released documents concerning the personal circumstances of an individual, was to be used for examination of how the researchers who participated in the research project in which the documents had been used had arrived at their results and conclusions, and so that E could generally maintain his competence as a paediatrician."

In its two subsequent judgments of 11 August 2003 the Administrative Court of Appeal decided on the conditions that would apply in connection with the release of the documents to them. The judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal had therefore settled the question of whether the documents were to be released to K and E once and for all.",

Once the judgments, against which no appeal could be made, had been issued in February 2003, whether or not the university considered that they were based on erroneous or insufficient grounds had no significance. After the February judgments the university was only required to formulate the conditions it considered necessary to avoid the risk of any individuals sustaining harm through the release of the documents. Subsequently the university had the opportunity to present its arguments to the Administrative Court of Appeal for the formulation of the conditions it had chosen. After the Administrative Court of Appeal had determined which conditions could be accepted, the question of the terms on which [K and E] could be allowed access to the documents requested was also settled once and for all. There was then no scope for the university to undertake any new appraisal of K’s and E’s right of access to the documents.",

Their contents were clear. [The Vice-Chancellor’s] letters of 14 August 2003 to [the applicant] and of 1 September 2003 to K and E show that the university administration had understood that it was incumbent on the university to release the documents without delay.",

According to the Vice-Chancellor, nothing transpired at the meeting on 18 August 2003 that could have given [the applicant] the impression that these instructions no longer applied or that they were not intended seriously. [The Vice-Chancellor’s] statement in this respect has been confirmed by the Director at the Vice-Chancellor’s office, W.

In addition, it can be seen from a number of e-mails from [the applicant] to [the Vice-Chancellor] that during the entire autumn he considered that he was required to hand over the documents and that he maintained his original refusal to obey his instructions. It has also been shown that when the Board met on 17 December 2003, [the Vice-Chancellor] was still considering making a complaint to the Disciplinary Board. Finally, [a witness, AW] has testified that at a meeting with [the applicant] shortly after the beginning of 2004, when asked whether he still persisted in his refusal, he confirmed that this was the case.",

It was incumbent on him to take the action required to comply with the judgments.",

His actions were, in other words, intentional and their result was that K and E were categorically denied a right that is guaranteed by the Constitution and that is also of fundamental importance in principle. All things considered, the Court of Appeal finds that [the applicant’s] conduct means that he disregarded the obligation that applied to him as head of department in such a manner that the offence of misuse of office should be considered. [The applicant] has however also objected that his conduct should be regarded as excusable in view of the other considerations that he had to bear in mind.",

These regulations must be considered to comply with the requirements of the Convention, and the judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal lay down how they are to be interpreted in this particular case.

No data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place. No information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she/he took part in a study undertaken by Östra Hospital and its present results will, as was the case for the previous study three years ago, be followed up.” A later assurance of confidentiality had the following wording: “Participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you.”",

The Court of Appeal notes that there is no possibility in law to provide greater secrecy than follows from the Secrecy Act and that it is not possible to make decisions on issues concerning confidentiality until the release of a document is requested.

The Court of Appeal notes that there are other possibilities of safeguarding research interests, for example by removing details that enable identification from research material so that sensitive information cannot be divulged.

                "39. The principle of public access to official documents ( offenlighetsprincipen ) has a history of more than two hundred years in Sweden and is one of the cornerstones of Swedish democracy. One of its main characteristics is the constitutional right for everyone to study and be informed of the contents of official documents held by the public authorities. This principle allows the public and the media to exercise scrutiny of the State, the municipalities and other parts of the public sector which, in turn, contributes to the free exchange of opinions and ideas and to efficient and correct management of public affairs and, thereby, to maintaining the legitimacy of the democratic system (see Govt. Bill 1975/76:160 pp. 69 et seq.). The principle of public access to official documents is enshrined in Chapter 2, Sections 1 and 12, of the Freedom of the Press Act. Thus, every Swedish citizen is entitled to have free access to official documents, in order to encourage the free exchange of opinion and the availability of comprehensive information (Chapter 2, Section 1; foreign nationals enjoy the same rights in this respect as Swedish citizens, Chapter 14, Section 5)."

A document is official if it is held by and is regarded as having been received or “drawn up” by a public authority (Chapter 2, Sections 3 and 6-7, of the Freedom of the Press Act). A document is “drawn up” when it is dispatched by an authority. A document that is not dispatched is “drawn up” when the matter to which it relates is finally settled by the authority in question. If the document does not relate to any specific matter, it is “drawn up” when it has been finally checked or has otherwise received its final form. As research is considered to be an activity in its own right (faktiskt handlande) ( see, for example, the Chancellor of Justice, 1986 p. 139), it cannot be said to relate to any specific matter. This means, in turn, that research material, as a rule, is “drawn up” and thereby official, as soon as it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form. It could be added that preliminary outlines, drafts, and similar documents enumerated in Chapter 2, Section 9, of the Freedom of the Press Act are not deemed to be official unless they introduce new factual information or have been accepted for filing. Finally, there is no general requirement that a document be filed in order to be considered official, and registration does not affect the issue of whether a document is official or not (cf. Chapter 15, Section 1, of the Secrecy Act)."

Such a decision should normally be rendered the same day or, if the public authority in question has to consider whether the requested document is official or whether the information is public, within a few days (see, for example, the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s decision of 23 November 2007 in case no. 5628-2006).

Pursuant to such a provision, the Government may issue more detailed provisions for its application in an ordinance ( förordning). Since the mandate to restrict the right of public access to official documents lies exclusively with the Swedish Parliament ( Riksdag ), it is not possible for a public authority to enter into an agreement with a third party exempting certain official documents from the right of public access, or to make similar arrangements."

                "44. The Secrecy Act contains provisions regarding the duty to observe secrecy in the activities of the community and regarding prohibitions against making official documents available (Chapter 1, Section 1). The latter provisions limit the right of access to official documents provided for in the Freedom of the Press Act ( Tryckfrihetsförordningen, SFS 1949:105). They relate to prohibitions on disclosing information, irrespective of the manner of disclosure. The question of whether secrecy should apply to information contained in an official document cannot be determined in advance, but must be examined each time a request for access to a document is made. Decisive for this issue is whether making a document available could imply a certain risk of harm. The risk of harm is defined in different ways in the Secrecy Act, having regard to the interests that the secrecy is intended to protect. Thus, the secrecy may be more or less strict depending on the interests involved. The secrecy legislation has been elaborated in this way in order to provide sufficient protection, for example, for the personal integrity of individuals, without the constitutional right of public access to official documents being circumscribed more than is considered necessary. In the present case, the Administrative Court of Appeal, in its judgments of 6 February 2003, found that secrecy applied to the research material under Chapter 7, Sections 1, 4, 9 and 13, of the Secrecy Act (Chapter 7 deals with secrecy with regard to the protection of the personal circumstances of individuals)."

As an example of such a restriction, the preparatory notes mention prohibiting the dissemination of the content of a document or the publication of secret information contained in a document (see Govt. Bill 1979/80:2, Part A, p. 349). An individual who has been granted access to a document subject to a restriction limiting the right to use the information may be held criminally liable if he or she does not respect that restriction (see Chapter 20, Section 3, of the Penal Code).",

A request to examine an official document must be made to the public authority which holds the document (Chapter 2, Section 14, of the Freedom of the Press Act and Chapter 15, Section 6, of the Secrecy Act). As mentioned above, there are specific requirements of promptness regarding the handling of such requests. A decision by an authority other than the Swedish Parliament or the Government to refuse access to a document is subject to appeal to the courts – as a general rule, an administrative court of appeal – and, further, to the Supreme Administrative Court (Chapter 2, Section 15, of the Freedom of the Press Act; Chapter 15, Section 7, of the Secrecy Act and Sections 33 and 35 of the 1971 Administrative Court Procedure Act ( Förvaltningsprocesslagen; SFS 1971:291)). Leave to appeal is required in the last-mentioned court. Only the person seeking access has a right of appeal. Thus, if the Administrative Court of Appeal – contrary to the public authority holding the document in question – decides that a document must be made available, its judgment is not open to appeal by the public authority in question, or by private subjects who consider that harm would be inflicted on them as a consequence of access to the document being granted (see RÅ 2005 note 1 and RÅ 2005 ref. 88). The reason why the right of appeal has been narrowly limited is that once the competing interests have been considered by a court the legislator has given priority to the principle of public access to official documents over other private and public interests (see, for example, Govt. Bill 1975/76:160 p. 203 and RÅ 2003 ref. 18, which concerned an institution’s request for relief for substantive defects).",

Formally, the head of the public authority has the primary responsibility to ensure that such requests are duly examined. However, the task may be delegated to other office holders within the authority and this is what is usually done in practice for the purposes of the authority’s daily activities. Such delegation has to be in accordance with the regulations of the authority (Section 21 of the former Government Agencies and Institutes Ordinance, Verksförordningen SFS 1995:1322, applicable at the relevant time). Irrespective of a public official’s particular competence or power under the regulations of the authority in question, he or she has a general duty to perform the tasks that are part of his or her official duties.

He was not the children’s doctor or psychiatrist and he did not represent the children or the parents. In their judgment convicting the applicant, the criminal courts found him guilty of misuse of office from 14 August 2003 to 7 May 2004 because he had refused to make the research material belonging to the University of Gothenburg available in compliance with the final judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal. The criminal courts did not, however, decide on whether K and E should have had access to the research material before it was destroyed in May 2004, because that question had already been determined by the Administrative Court of Appeal in its judgments of 6 February and 11 August 2003. Whether or not the latter judgments breached a right under Article 8 of the Convention not to impart confidential information, as the applicant claims, falls outside the scope of the Grand Chamber’s jurisdiction (see paragraphs 53-56 above)."

                "66. The concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person’s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects in addition a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, ECHR 2008)."

The Court reiterates in this regard that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one’s own actions such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence (see, inter alia, Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, § 49, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII, and Mikolajová v. Slovakia, no. 4479/03, § 57, 18 January 2011)."

The applicant also contended that the criminal conviction had adversely affected his moral and psychological integrity and that he had suffered personally, socially, psychologically and economically. The Court observes that the protection of an individual’s moral and psychological integrity is an important aspect of Article 8 of the Convention. It notes, however, that there is no Convention case-law in which the Court has accepted that a criminal conviction in itself constitutes an interference with the convict’s right to respect for private life. The Court does not ignore that such a criminal conviction may entail personal, social, psychological and economic suffering for the convicted person. In the Court’s view, though, such repercussions may be foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence and can therefore not be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounts to an interference with the right to respect for “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

Nevertheless, in that case the applicants complained that their convictions were the result of an unforeseeable application of a provision of the criminal law to their consensual sado-masochistic activities between adults. The Court expressed doubt as to whether those activities fell entirely within the notion of “private life” in the particular circumstances of that case, but saw no reason to examine the issue of its own motion since that point was not disputed by the parties ( Laskey, Jaggard and Brown, § 36)."

His conviction was not the result of an unforeseeable application of that provision and the offence in question has no obvious bearing on the right to respect for “private life”. On the contrary, it concerns professional acts and omissions by public officials in the exercise of their duties. Nor has the applicant pointed to any concrete repercussions on his private life which were directly and causally linked to his conviction for that specific offence."

He did point out, though, that he had found himself in a dilemma and that he had chosen to refuse to comply with the judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal, with the risk that he would be convicted of misuse of office. This confirms, in the Court’s opinion, that the applicant’s conviction and the suffering it may have entailed were foreseeable consequences of his having committed the criminal offence."

The applicant also contended that he had lost income because he was dismissed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and could have written at least five books during the time taken up by the case. To the extent that this is to be understood as a claim that the applicant’s conviction affected the enjoyment of his “private life” because of its bearing on his professional activities (see, among other authorities, Turán v. Hungary, no. 33068/05, 6 July 2010; Sidabras and Džiautas (cited above); Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ III; and Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251 ‑ B), the Court considers this form of economic suffering to be a foreseeable consequence of the commission of a criminal offence by the applicant in respect of which Article 8 cannot be relied on (see paragraph 68 above)."

At any rate, the Court observes that the criminal conviction of the applicant had no negative bearing on his maintaining his position as professor and head of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Gothenburg. Furthermore, even if the applicant’s allegation that he was dismissed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health is an established fact, the Court notes that the applicant failed to show that there was any causal link between the conviction and the dismissal. Moreover, the applicant’s claim that he had lost income from at least five books which he had planned to write, but had been unable to because his time was taken up by the case, remains wholly unsubstantiated. Finally, according to the applicant, he had support from numerous renowned and highly respected scientists who agreed with the conduct for which he was convicted. There is therefore no indication that the impugned conviction had any repercussions on the applicant’s professional activities which went beyond the foreseeable consequences of the criminal offence for which he was convicted."

Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. Moreover, Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see among other authorities, Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 53, 12 September 2011)."

The project was originally set up and started by other researchers, but the applicant subsequently took over responsibility for completing the study. The material belonged to the University and was stored at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of which the applicant was head. Accordingly, the material consisted of public documents subject to the principle of public access under the Freedom of the Press Act and the Secrecy Act. That entailed, among other things, that secrecy could not be determined until a request for access was submitted, and it was impossible in advance for a public authority to enter into an agreement with a third party exempting certain official documents from the right to public access (see paragraphs 43 and 44). Nevertheless, in his letter of 17 February 1984 to the parents of the children participating in the research project, the applicant stated, inter alia: “All data will be dealt with in confidentiality and classified as secret. No data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place. No information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she/he took part in a study undertaken by Östra Hospital, and its present results will, as was the case for the previous study three years ago, be followed up.” In a later, undated, letter to the participants, the applicant submitted: “Participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you.”"

It follows therefore that the assurances of confidentiality cited above did not take precedence over the law as it stood or a court’s application of the statutes”. Equally important, in the period referred to in the indictment, namely from 11 August 2003 to 7 May 2004, it was no longer the secrecy legislation that was to be interpreted by the criminal courts but rather the judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal, which had settled once and for all the question of whether and on what conditions the documents were to be released to K and E."

The additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2003, further requires the criminalisation of hate speech, xenophobia and racism.

He argued that the random possibility of seeking civil damages, particularly from a third party, was not sufficient to protect his rights. He emphasised that he did not have the means to identify the person who had placed the advertisement on the Internet. While compensation might in some cases be an effective remedy, this depended on whether it was paid by the person who had infringed the victim ’ s rights, which was not the case in his application. According to the Government, new legislation was in place which, had it existed at the time of the events, would have rendered this complaint unnecessary. In the applicant ’ s view, the Government had not provided any justification for the failure to afford him this protection at the material time.

The impugned act was considered in domestic law as an act of malicious misrepresentation and would have been punishable as such, which had a deterrent effect. An investigation had been initiated to identify the person who had placed the advertisement on the Internet, but had proved unsuccessful due to the legislation in force at the time, which aimed to protect freedom of expression and the right to anonymous expression. The legislation protected the publisher of an anonymous Internet message so extensively that the protection also covered messages that possibly interfered with another person ’ s privacy. This side - effect of the protection was due to the fact that the concept of a message interfering with the protection of privacy was not clear cut, and therefore it had not been possible to clearly exclude such messages from the protection provided by law. There were, however, other avenues of redress available, for example the Personal Data Act, which provided protection against malicious misrepresentation in that the operator of the Internet server, on the basis of that Act ’ s provisions on criminal liability and liability in damages, was obliged to ensure that sensitive data recorded by it were processed with the consent of the data subject. Furthermore, although the personal data offence had become time-barred, the applicant still had the possibility of seeking compensation from the publisher of the advertisement. By comparison with the X and Y v. the Netherlands case ( 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91 ), in the present case liability in damages in the context of a less serious offence provided a sufficient deterrent effect.

The current legislation, the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media Act (sections 2 and 17), which took effect on 1 January 2004, gives the police more extensive powers to break the protection of the publisher of an anonymous Internet message for the purposes of criminal investigations. The new legislation reflects the legislator ’ s reaction to social development where increased use – and at the same time abuse – of the Internet has required a redefinition of the limits of protection. Thus, because of a changed situation in society, subsequent legislation has further strengthened the protection of private life in respect of freedom of expression, and especially the protection of the publishers of anonymous Internet messages."

While the choice of the means to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of protection against acts of individuals is, in principle, within the State ’ s margin of appreciation, effective deterrence against grave acts, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake, requires efficient criminal-law provisions ( see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, §§ 23 ‑ 24 and 27; August v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 36505/02, 21 January 2003; and M.C. v.

They argued that protection was provided by the mere existence of the criminal offence of malicious misrepresentation and by the possibility of bringing criminal charges or an action for damages against the server operator. As to the former, the Court notes that the existence of an offence has limited deterrent effects if there is no means to identify the actual offender and to bring him to justice. Here, the Court notes that it has not excluded the possibility that the State ’ s positive obligations under Article 8 to safeguard the individual ’ s physical or moral integrity may extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation even where the criminal liability of agents of the State is not at issue (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, § 128, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII). For the Court, States have a positive obligation inherent in Article 8 of the Convention to criminalise offences against the person, including attempted offences, and to reinforce the deterrent effect of criminalisation by applying criminal ‑ law provisions in practice through effective investigation and prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 153). Where the physical and moral welfare of a child is threatened, such injunction assumes even greater importance. The Court notes in this connection that sexual abuse is unquestionably an abhorrent type of wrongdoing, with debilitating effects on its victims. Children and other vulnerable individuals are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, from such grave types of interference with essential aspects of their private lives (see Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, § 64, Reports 1996 ‑ IV )."

As to the Government ’ s argument that the applicant had the possibility to obtain damages from a third party, namely the service provider, the Court considers that it was not sufficient in the circumstances of this case. It is plain that both the public interest and the protection of the interests of victims of crimes committed against their physical or psychological well-being require the availability of a remedy enabling the actual offender to be identified and brought to justice, in the instant case the person who placed the advertisement in the applicant ’ s name, and the victim to obtain financial reparation from him."

The Court accepts that, in view of the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, a positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities or, as in this case, the legislator. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that powers to control, prevent and investigate crime are exercised in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on criminal investigations and bringing offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, guarantees which offenders themselves can rely on. The Court is sensitive to the Government ’ s argument that any legislative shortcoming should be seen in its social context at the time. The Court notes at the same time that the relevant incident took place in 1999, that is, at a time when it was well-known that the Internet, precisely because of its anonymous character, could be used for criminal purposes (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above). Also, the widespread problem of child sexual abuse had become well known over the preceding decade. Therefore, it cannot be said that the respondent Government did not have the opportunity to put in place a system to protect child victims from being exposed as targets for paedophiliac approaches via the Internet."

The Court considers that practical and effective protection of the applicant required that effective steps be taken to identify and prosecute the perpetrator, that is, the person who placed the advertisement. In the instant case, such protection was not afforded. An effective investigation could never be launched because of an overriding requirement of confidentiality. Although freedom of expression and confidentiality of communications are primary considerations and users of telecommunications and Internet services must have a guarantee that their own privacy and freedom of expression will be respected, such guarantee cannot be absolute and must yield on occasion to other legitimate imperatives, such as the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Without prejudice to the question whether the conduct of the person who placed the offending advertisement on the Internet can attract the protection of Articles 8 and 10, having regard to its reprehensible nature, it is nonetheless the task of the legislator to provide the framework for reconciling the various claims which compete for protection in this context. Such framework was not, however, in place at the material time, with the result that Finland ’ s positive obligation with respect to the applicant could not be discharged. This deficiency was later addressed. However, the mechanisms introduced by the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media Act (see paragraph 21 above) came too late for the applicant."

In the present case, it was common ground between Government, Commission and applicants that a basis for the interferences was to be found in the Prison Act and the Rules, but not in the Orders and Instructions which lacked the force of law (see paragraph 26 above).

These observations are of particular weight in the \"circumstances\" of the present case, involving as it does, in the special context of imprisonment, the screening of approximately ten million items of correspondence in a year (see paragraph 57 above). It would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality. Indeed, the applicants themselves did not deny that some discretion should be left to the authorities.",

And in the present case the operation of the correspondence control system was not merely a question of practice that varied in each individual instance: the Orders and Instructions established a practice which had to be followed save in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above). In these conditions, the Court considers that although those directives did not themselves have the force of law, they may - to the admittedly limited extent to which those concerned were made sufficiently aware of their contents - be taken into account in assessing whether the criterion of foreseeability was satisfied in the application of the Rules."

One of the principles underlying the Convention is the rule of law, which implies that an interference by the authorities with an individual ’ s rights should be subject to effective control (see, inter alia, the Klass and others judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, pp. 25-26, § 55). This is especially so where, as in the present case, the law bestows on the executive wide discretionary powers, the application whereof is a matter of practice which is susceptible to modification but not to any Parliamentary scrutiny (see paragraph 26 above).",

In fact, the question of safeguards against abuse is closely linked with the question of effective remedies and the Court finds it preferable to take this issue into account in the wider context of Article 13 (art. 13) (see paragraphs 111-119 below).",

The Government contested the Commission ’ s view that the relevant practice, by excluding correspondence with persons of good character, went further than could reasonably be deduced from Rule 34(8) in conjunction with Rule 33(1) and that the stopping of these letters was accordingly not \"in accordance with the law\".",

However, the wording of Rule 34(8) (see paragraph 29 above) is itself quite explicit: a reader would see not that correspondence with persons other than friends or relatives is allowed subject to certain exceptions but rather that it is prohibited save where the Secretary of State gives leave. Moreover, the Court considers that account should also be taken of Rule 33(2) - which contains a prohibition similar to that found in Rule 34(8) - and of Rule 34(2), from which it would be apparent that there were limits on the quantity of the correspondence of convicted prisoners (see paragraphs 29 and 38 above).",

Whilst not contesting the Commission ’ s view that the stopping of certain other letters in the same category was not foreseeable since the \"prior ventilation rule\" was not contained in the Rules themselves, the Government submitted that the position was otherwise as regards these two items.

                "Nicole Coste (N.C.) : Eight years ago, on a Nice to Paris flight ... Before landing he asked for my telephone number. Two weeks later I had a message on my mobile ...",
                "... He wanted to invite me to Monaco ... I went there the following weekend ... We spent a very tender night next to each other, it was very romantic! After that weekend he called me to say that he had had a very pleasant time and that he wanted to see me again.",

                "I had the impression that something was happening. He didn ’ t speak about his feelings, but I heard his heart beating. There are signs that can ’ t be mistaken when you ’ re in someone ’ s arms ... He didn ’ t say anything to me and I didn ’ t ask him anything. But he had tender looks and gestures towards me, even in public, and even in front of other young women. I think that he appreciated my affection. He told his friends that I was very very loving, and that he liked my maternal side. For my part, I found him touching.",
                "N.C. For the first five years I went to Monaco about once a month ... Sometimes he took me along to official events, such as the World Music Awards or tennis tournaments ...",
                "P.M. Did you ever meet his father, Prince Rainier?",
                "N.C. Yes. At a dinner with about twenty guests; Albert told me that we couldn ’ t go along together, since his father [would be] there. In the afternoon, he indirectly made me his loveliest declaration of love, by saying to a friend in front of everyone ‘ Take good care of Nicole. I am very fond of her. ’ And he kissed me ...",
                "P.M. What did he tell you about his talk with his father?",
                "N.C. We spoke about it the next day. I found him strange. I became worried. ‘ I ’ ve been thinking ’, he said. ‘ I believe it ’ s better if we stay friends. ’",
                "N.C. ... I was crying. I telephoned him to find out if it was really over. ‘ If you were in my situation, what would you do? ’ He answered ‘ I would wait. Not for long, but I would wait ... ” ...",

                "N.C. It ’ s true, the relationship deteriorated after that. At the same time, however, he seemed to be afraid of taking a decision; he hesitated, taking one step forward and two steps back ...",
                "... Albert is not someone who expresses his feelings or who argues. He has a good sense of humour. I had the impression that he still had feelings. We saw each other with more or less the same frequency, but for less time, one day instead of three. I had the impression that he was afraid of becoming too attached. In December 2002 I wanted us to celebrate my ... birthday together. He suggested that I come to Monaco ... we went [out] for a drink. There were lots of young women coming up to him, and I let him know that I wasn ’ t happy about that. On returning to the flat, we became lovers again, something that I didn ’ t want that night. The evening had annoyed me.",

I said to him ‘ If I ’ m pregnant, what are we going to do? ’ He replied ‘ If you ’ re pregnant, you must keep it ’. He said it from the heart. He immediately began thinking of boys ’ names, and I was coming up with girls ’ names, since I already had two boys. He said ‘ I ’ m trying to think of boys ’ names – that ’ s all you know how to make!” ...",
                "Shortly afterwards, I had a positive pregnancy test ... I wanted him to take a decision very quickly ... I was well aware of what a child represented for Albert, given his position. In my opinion, it was for him to decide ... He said to me ‘ Keep it. I ’ ll look after things. You won ’ t lack for anything. I don ’ t promise to marry you, but keep him and don ’ t worry: I ’ ll bring him into the family little by little. I ’ d like us to keep the news to ourselves for the moment. The only person I must tell is my adviser and childhood friend, whom you know well. ’",

He seemed to have changed his mind, but as far as I was concerned it was too late. The adviser said to me ‘ Do you realise that if it ’ s a boy, they ’ ll use that to prevent Albert acceding to the throne, and the child will be able to claim the throne ’. I was surprised that he was going into things that were only details for me. I wasn ’ t even thinking about these questions ... it is clear to me that a child born outside marriage cannot accede to the throne.",
                "N.C. I learned that I was expecting a boy. I was very worried ... I asked him if it would make things difficult if it was a boy ... ‘ No, no more than if it were a girl. ’ He put his hand on my stomach and we discussed names again ...",
                "When I was five-and-a-half months ’ pregnant, I called him. He didn ’ t behave the way he usually did with me, I understood that something had happened and that he wanted to end the relationship. He said ‘ I ’ ve thought it through. I ’ ve asked for advice. The child is impossible ’.",
                "I went to see a lawyer, who alerted Albert ’ s lawyer. Albert called me immediately, and was very annoyed: ‘ You ’ ve trapped me... ’ He spoke to me as though he had been brainwashed. I was eight months ’ pregnant, and had become pregnant six years after our first meeting. I would have had multiple opportunities to become pregnant.",
                "N.C. 24 August 2003 is not my happiest memory. I was very alone. On the day I left hospital ... I was visited by a French laboratory, approved by the Swiss Forensic Institute, for a DNA swab from my son. That was organised by his adviser.",
                "My two older children still didn ’ t know who their little brother ’ s father was ... Alexandre was sleeping in my bedroom, in a crib ... He suffered from asthma and was hospitalised for six weeks ... I had to deal with this alone, with no one to confide in.",
                "P.M. When did he see Alexandre for the first time?",
                "N.C. Two and a half months after his birth ... the most important thing for me was that Alexandre be recognised. It was out of the question that my child would not have a father. That is how I explained it to them. For me, non-recognition would have been the only basis for taking things to court. It was up to Albert to organise things so that this little baby had a more or less normal life, even if, at the very beginning, it had been necessary to hide him. But I didn ’ t want him to grow up like Mazarine, for example. I thought only about that, and not for a second about the fact that he represented a potential heir. Meanwhile, Albert was paying me a sum every three months that I still receive.",
                "P.M. What happened subsequently?",
                "N.C. As I didn ’ t really trust my lawyer any longer, I contacted another one, to whom I explained that the only thing that counted was that Albert recognise his son. In my opinion, non-recognition of a child amounts to denying him his roots ...",
                "P.M. Did Albert realise how important it was for you that he recognise this child?",
                "N.C. Ultimately, yes, to my great joy: on 15 December 2003 he arranged to meet me at a notary ’ s office, with his adviser ...",
                "P.M. What happened during the meeting at the notary ’ s office?",
                "N.C. Albert signed the deed of recognition. He did it out of respect for me, while giving instructions that this deed was not to be transcribed in the official register until after his father ’ s death.",
                "P.M. Do you have a copy of this deed of recognition?",
                "N.C. I wasn ’ t given any papers, I only have the registration number of the deed. I asked the notary several times for a certificate stating that he had a document concerning my son. I was told ‘ Later ’. After Rainier ’ s funeral I contacted the notary again, asking that Albert ’ s undertaking be upheld, and that the official recognition of our son ’ s paternity be entered in the register of births and deaths. Again, the notary told me that it could wait ... I again asked for a copy of the deed. He refused. ..",

                "P.M. What contact have you had with Albert since seeing him at the notary ’ s office to sign the deed recognising your son?",
                "N.C. I wanted him to see his son regularly, and also to call for news of him. He has done that ... During one of his visits, I said ‘ Just because we ’ ve had a child, that doesn ’ t mean that everything has to end between us ’. He replied ‘ For the moment, I prefer that we end things, because if we continue we ’ ll end up with a second child! ’",
                "P.M. Why have you decided to speak out?",
                "N.C. I ’ ve already given you some reasons. I want Alexandre to grow up normally, with a father. I want the lies to stop. For my part, I ’ m fed up with lying, hiding and passing for the mistress of his friends. On account of this silence, I no longer have an identity and I live almost like an outlaw. I ’ m afraid for my son ’ s psychological health. I should like to have him baptised as soon as possible, with a correctly drawn up birth certificate. In addition, I understand that there are rumours going around about this child, and I want the truth to be re-established, so that his two older brothers have a dignified image of their mother."

The Court of Appeal concluded that the publication in question had caused the Prince irreversible damage in that the fact of his paternity, which he had wished to keep secret and which had remained so from the child ’ s birth until publication of the impugned article, had suddenly, and against his will, become public knowledge. It considered that the non-pecuniary damage thus caused justified an order for publication of the court ruling as supplementary compensation, and that, in view of the nature of the breach and the seriousness of its consequences, such a measure was not disproportionate to the competing interests involved and, on the contrary, represented the most adequate redress in the particular circumstances of the case.

They considered that, even if improbable, this scenario remained legally possible, and could therefore become the subject of a general debate regarding the future of the Monegasque monarchy, and that, in addition, the fact that the child was of Togolese origin could contribute to a debate of general interest which had the potential to change the image of a particularly conservative principality."

The question of his paternity concerned not only his own civil status – it was not without importance to know whether or not he had an illegitimate son and if so whether he had recognised him – but also the order of heirs or even possible successors to the throne, in view of the hereditary nature of the monarchy in Monaco and in the absence, at the relevant time, of any known heir. The applicants emphasised in this regard that the provisions of the Monegasque Constitution had been amended shortly before Prince Rainier ’ s death and that further amendments could not be ruled out.

They further asserted that communication of the news to the public was all the more legitimate in that the Prince had ultimately recognised his son, in the context of a large-scale media operation.

In this connection, they submitted that in a democratic society the wishes of one person, even a sovereign, could not confer privileges to the extent that they trespassed on the rights of others and, in particular acted as a “ bar to the claims of his son seeking to assert his existence and have his identity recognised”."

The photographs showing the Prince in Ms Coste ’ s company had, they submitted, been taken in the context of official events, so the magazine could not be criticised for publishing them. Only photographs handed over by the child ’ s mother had been published, with a view to lending credence to her statements. Moreover, neither the veracity of the published information nor the conditions in which that information and the accompanying photographs had been given to the magazine had been challenged.

With regard to the consequences of the article, the applicants denied that it could have disclosed anything that had not already been revealed to the public by the British, American, German and French press and audio - visual media and on the Internet.

They considered that only the Prince ’ s right to private life had been taken into account in assessing the alleged violation and the resulting damage. In addition, they considered that the penalties imposed had been very severe : in their view, a court-ordered publication was equivalent to expropriating a newspaper and eliminating a space used to exercise freedom of expression, and had the weight and effect of a public reprimand designed to discredit the magazine."

They criticised the domestic courts for failing to take account of that fact in assessing the extent of the alleged damage. They concluded that the publication in issue had been manifestly legitimate and that, in consequence, there had been no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the severe court judgments against them, together with the insertion of a court-ordered statement on the front cover of the magazine, and the aim pursued.",

Referring to the margin of appreciation granted to the States in this area, they argued that in the area of freedom of expression, which implied a subjective approach, the national courts were best placed to classify the facts of a case, and that the Court ’ s supervision should not seek to substitute a new assessment of the facts for that of the national courts. In the present case, the domestic courts had carried out a careful analysis and sought to strike a balance between the protection of private life and that of freedom of expression.

Thus, in France, the legislation and case-law were, they submitted, more protective of private life than in Germany or the United Kingdom. That being noted, the purpose of the Convention was not to harmonise national laws.

In the present case, the considerations relating to the paternity of a child who was clearly excluded from succession to the throne could not fall within the scope of a debate of public interest. According to the Monegasque Government, the main – if not the sole – purpose of the article had been to satisfy the curiosity of a certain readership with regard to the private life of public figures.

Yet the Chamber judgment created a grave risk in this regard, namely that the protection afforded to political figures ’ private lives would henceforth be severely restricted, or indeed reduced to nought.

It extends to aspects relating to personal identity, such as a person ’ s name, photograph, or physical and moral integrity. This concept also includes the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 95, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). The guarantee afforded by Article 8 of the Convention in this regard is primarily intended to ensure the development, without outside interference, of the personality of each individual in his or her relations with other human beings. There is thus a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of private life."

Moreover, whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life, the same is not true of public figures (see Minelli v. Switzerland ( dec. ), no. 14991/02, 14 June 2005). Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, even where a person is known to the general public, he or she may rely on a “legitimate expectation” of protection of and respect for his or her private life (see, inter alia, Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 97 )."

The Court has held on numerous occasions that a photograph may contain very personal or even intimate “information” about an individual or his or her family ( ibid., § 103). It has therefore recognised every person ’ s right to protection of his or her own image, emphasising that a person ’ s image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality, as it reveals the person ’ s unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from his or her peers. The right to the protection of one ’ s image is thus one of the essential components of personal development. It mainly presupposes the individual ’ s right to control the use of that image, including the right to refuse publication thereof ( ibid., § 96)."

                "86. In determining whether or not the publication of a photograph interferes with an applicant ’ s right to respect for his or her private life, the Court takes account of the manner in which the information or photograph was obtained. In particular, it stresses the importance of obtaining the consent of the persons concerned, and the more or less strong sense of intrusion caused by a photograph (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI, § 5 9; Gurgenidze v. Georgia, no. 71678/01, §§ 55-60, 17 October 2006; and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France, no. 71111/01, § 48, 14 June 2007). In this connection, the Court has had occasion to note that photographs appearing in the “sensationalist” press or in “romance” magazines, which generally aim to satisfy the public ’ s curiosity regarding the details of a person ’ s strictly private life (see Société Prisma Presse v. France ( dec. ), no. 66910/01, 1 July 2003; Société Prisma Presse v. France ( dec. ), no. 71612/01, 1 July 2003; and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France ( ICI PARIS ), no. 12268/03, § 40, 23 July 2009), are often obtained in a climate of continual harassment which may induce in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59). Another factor in the Court ’ s assessment is the purpose for which a photograph was used and how it could be used subsequently (see Reklos and Davourlis v. Greece, no. 1234/05, § 42, 15 January 2009, and Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 52)."

Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “ democratic society ”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and, among other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others, its task is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Thus, the task of imparting information necessarily includes “duties and responsibilities”, as well as limits which the press must impose on itself spontaneously (see Mater v. Turkey, no. 54997/08, § 55, 16 July 2013). Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, §§ 59 and 62, ECHR 1999 ‑ III; Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 71, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 102). Furthermore, it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted in a particular case (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298, and Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 146, ECHR 2007 ‑ V). Freedom of expression includes the publication of photographs. This is nonetheless an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance, as the photographs may contain very personal or even intimate information about an individual or his or her family ( see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 103). Lastly, although the publication of news about the private life of public figures is generally for the purposes of entertainment rather than education, it contributes to the variety of information available to the public and undoubtedly benefits from the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. However, such protection may cede to the requirements of Article 8 where the information at stake is of a private and intimate nature and there is no public interest in its dissemination (see Mosley v. the United Kingdom, no. 48009/08, § 131, 10 May 2011).",

Likewise, under Article 10 of the Convention, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression protected by this provision is necessary (ibid.). However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those delivered by an independent court. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court ’ s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on (ibid. , § 105, with further references )."

Indeed, as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect ( ibid., § 106). Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both cases."

The margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts ( see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 107)."

Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 90-95, 7 February 2012). The relevant criteria thus defined are: contribution to a debate of public interest, the degree of notoriety of the person affected, the subject of the news report, the prior conduct of the person concerned, the content, form and consequences of the publication, and, where appropriate, the circumstances in which the photographs were taken. Where it examines an application lodged under Article 10, the Court will also examine the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity, and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the journalists or publishers ( ibid.).

Thus, the purely private and family interest represented by a person ’ s descent is supplemented by a public aspect, related to the social and legal structure of kinship.

The fact that the Prince ’ s son was born out of wedlock is irrelevant in this regard.

I thought only about that, and not for a second about the fact that he represented a potential heir. ” Thus, reference was also made to the reasons which may have incited the Prince to refuse to recognise his paternity officially and to prefer to keep it secret. In addition, through Ms Coste ’ s comments stating that she was “afraid for [her] son ’ s psychological health” and wished him “to grow up normally, with a father”, the article also touched on the child ’ s best interests in having the father-child relationship, an important aspect of his personal identity, officially established."

This was equally true with regard to his behaviour in respect of the child ’ s mother – who was unable to obtain either the notarial deed of recognition of her son, or its transcription into the register of births, marriages and deaths ( see paragraph 17 above ) – and the child himself: this information could provide insights into the Prince ’ s personality, particularly with regard to the way in which he approached and assumed his responsibilities."

Moreover, in view of the articles published in the Daily Mail and in Bunte ( see paragraphs 9 and 11 above ), the Court notes that the child ’ s status as a potential heir was already a matter of public discussion."

In the event, however, they refused to take into consideration the interest that the article ’ s central message – namely the existence of a child who had been fathered by the Prince – could have for the public, and instead concentrated on the details provided by Ms Coste about the couple ’ s intimate relationship. In so doing, they deprived the public -interest justification relied upon by the applicants of any effectiveness."

The extent to which an individual has a public profile or is well known influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life.

The Court subscribes to the analysis of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, finding that “ public figures must recognise that the position they occupy in society – in many cases by choice – automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy” ( point 6 of Resolution 1165 (1998), see paragraph 43 above)."

The domestic courts ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life. Yet they refrained from including this circumstance in their assessment of the facts submitted for their examination. Thus, although it reiterated that an exception could be made to the principle of protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact given the status or function of the person concerned ( see paragraph 26 above ), the Versailles Court of Appeal drew no conclusion from that consideration in the present case.

                "“Personal contact with a child born out of wedlock is intended to allow a father to satisfy himself as to the child's welfare and development and preserve the natural ties existing between them. It is not therefore the purpose of granting access, but the legal conditions for doing so, which differ: while a parent who does not have custody of a child born in wedlock is entitled to access under Article 1634 [of the Civil Code], Article 1711 [of the Code] does not grant a right of access to the father of a child born out of wedlock. Rather, the law leaves it up to the person having custody, as a rule the mother, to determine whether, and to what extent, the father should be able to spend time with his child. However, the guardianship court may decide that the father is entitled to access if this is in the child's best interests. The main reason for the weaker legal position of the father of a child born out of wedlock is his different social position. After the Federal Constitutional Court's decisions of 1971 and 1981, the constitutionality of Article 1711 can no longer be seriously doubted. For considerations of legal policy, a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock is even more urgently necessary. In the meantime, the courts are bound by Article 1711.",
                "Under that provision, the guardianship court decides to grant a father access to a child born out of wedlock if this is beneficial for the child's welfare. It is not enough for such contact to be consistent with, or not contrary to, the child's interests, it must serve those interests and promote them. This interpretation justifies the assumption that fathers should generally be granted access to their children because this enables the latter to develop as normally as possible and helps them to form a clear image of themselves and their origin. It is in fact important for children not simply to have a fantasy picture of their fathers, but to be able to form a personal, realistic picture.",
                "Whether contact with the father is conducive to the child's well-being depends initially on the father's motives for seeking it. The Regional Court is convinced that the father in this case is motivated by attachment to [G.] and genuine affection for her. Even when a father acts from responsible motives, however, the court is not necessarily obliged to grant him access if there are serious tensions between the parents, these are communicated to the child, and there is reason to fear that every meeting with the father will interfere with the child's further undisturbed development in the residual family provided by the mother ...",
                "In view of the findings in the [psychological expert] report referred to above, it must be assumed that this would happen in the instant case. If the father were granted access to [G.] in present circumstances, she would have to shuttle between hostile camps, which should not be asked of her.",
                "If – as in this case – there is a danger that differences between parents may affect a child, then special circumstances are needed to justify the assumption that contact with the father will nevertheless have permanently beneficial effects on the child's development or well-being ... However, no such circumstances can be discerned here. It is true that, for the first two years of her life, [G.] grew up with both father and mother, but this period was not conflict-free. The disagreements and sometimes open aggression between her parents – in other words, the family violence she witnessed – have certainly left their mark on her, even if she can no longer recall them spontaneously. As the psychological report indicates, she has also repressed her old ties with her father – a fact reflected in the care she takes to avoid talking about him. In view of all this, the report finds that she does not suffer as a result of the present situation.",
                "The Court can rely fully on the report, which has no apparent defects and is not invalidated by the fact that the father sees the situation differently.",
                "In finding that therapy had not enabled the parents to put their former conflicts behind them, thus making it possible for [G.] to have access to both of them, the Court did not have to decide who was to blame for this ... The decisive factor is always the child's point of view. As already pointed out, however, the situation in this case is such that the parents must first initiate dialogue with each other.”"

As to the situation of divorced fathers of children born in wedlock in comparison with that of fathers of children born out of wedlock, the Court observes at the outset that, at the material time, the relevant provisions of the German Civil Code, namely Article 1634 § 1 regarding parents not having custody of children born in wedlock and Article 1711 § 2 regarding fathers of children born out of wedlock, contained different standards (see paragraphs 33-34 above). The former category of parent had a legal right of access which could be restricted or suspended if necessary in the child's interests, whereas the latter's personal contact depended on a favourable decision by the child's mother or on a court ruling finding such contact to be in the child's interests."

In cases arising from individual applications it is not, however, the Court's task to examine the domestic legislation in the abstract, but it must examine the manner in which that legislation was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances. The Court therefore does not find it necessary to consider whether the former German legislation as such, namely, Article 1711 § 2 of the Civil Code, made an unjustifiable distinction between fathers of children born out of wedlock and divorced fathers, such as to be discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention. The question to be decided by the Court is whether the application of Article 1711 § 2 of the Civil Code in the present case led to an unjustified difference in the treatment of the applicant in comparison with the case of a divorced couple (see Elsholz, cited above, § 59)."

                "“55. The approach taken by the German courts in the present case reflects the underlying legislation which put fathers of children born out of wedlock in a different, less favourable position than divorced fathers. Unlike the latter, natural fathers had no right of access to their children and the mother's refusal of access could only be overridden by a court when access was'in the interests of the child'. Under such rules and circumstances, there was evidently a heavy burden of proof on the side of a father of a child born out of wedlock. The crucial point is that the courts did not regard contact between a child and the natural father prima facie as in the child's interests, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child's relations with the father. The mother's negative attitude and the inevitable tensions between the parents in a situation of conflict, irrespective of the father's responsible motives, being thereby decisive for refusing access, there are reasons to conclude that the applicant as a natural father was treated less favourably than a divorced father in proceedings to suspend his existing right of access.",
                "56. For the purposes of Article 14 a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, that is if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Camp and Bourimi v. the Netherlands, no. 28369/95, § 37, ECHR 2000-X).",
                "57. According to the Court's case-law, very weighty reasons need to be put forward before a difference in treatment on the ground of birth out of wedlock can be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see Camp and Bourimi, cited above, § 38).",
                "58. In the present case, the Court is not persuaded by the Government's arguments, which are based on general considerations that fathers of children born out of wedlock lack interest in contact with their children and might leave a non-marital relationship at any time.",
                "59. Such considerations did not apply in the applicant's case. He had in fact been living with the mother at the time of the child's birth in June 1988 and had maintained contact with her until October 1990. He had acknowledged paternity and undertaken to pay maintenance. More importantly, he had continued to show concrete interest in contact with her for sincere motives.",

When deciding the applicant's case, the Regional Court stated the urgent need for legislative reform. Complaints challenging the constitutionality of the legislation were pending before the Federal Constitutional Court. The new family legislation eventually came into force in July 1998.",
                "The Court wishes to make it clear that these amendments cannot in themselves be taken as demonstrating that the previous rules were contrary to the Convention. They do however show that the aim of the legislation in question, namely the protection of the interests of children and their parents, could also have been achieved without distinction on the ground of birth (see, mutatis mutandis, Inze v.

In that connection it observed that the German courts'decisions were clearly based on the danger to the child's development if he had to resume contact with his father, the applicant, contrary to the will of the mother, and on the finding that contact would negatively affect the child.

Having regard to the fact that these courts were convinced of the applicant's responsible motives, his attachment to his child and his genuine affection for her, they placed a burden on him which was heavier than the one on divorced fathers under Article 1634 § 1 of the Civil Code. The Court also notes that the Regional Court, while regarding a reform of the legislation on children born out of wedlock as being urgently necessary, expressly stated that it considered itself bound by Article 1711 § 2, which placed fathers of children born out of wedlock in a weaker legal position."

Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his rights. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 55 - 56)."

The activity or danger against which a particular series of surveillance measures is directed may continue for years, even decades, after the suspension of those measures. Subsequent notification to each individual affected by a suspended measure might well jeopardise the long-term purpose that originally prompted the surveillance. Furthermore, such notification might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents. Therefore, the fact that persons concerned by secret surveillance measures are not subsequently notified once surveillance has ceased cannot by itself warrant the conclusion that the interference was not “necessary in a democratic society”, as it is the very absence of knowledge of surveillance which ensures the efficacy of the interference. As soon as notification can be carried out without jeopardising the purpose of the restriction after the termination of the surveillance measure, information should, however, be provided to the persons concerned (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135). The Court also takes note of the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, which provides that where data concerning an individual have been collected and stored without his knowledge, and unless the data are deleted, he should be informed, where practicable, that information is held about him as soon as the object of the police activities is no longer likely to be prejudiced (§ 2.2, see paragraph 143 above)."

The judgment the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU ) of 8 April 2014 in the joined cases of Digital Rights Ireland and Seitinger and Others (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238) declared invalid the Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC laying down the obligation on the providers of publicly available electronic communication services or of public communications networks to retain all traffic and location data for periods from six months to two years, in order to ensure that the data were available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law. The CJEU noted that, even though the Directive did not permit the retention of the content of the communication, the traffic and location data covered by it might allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data had been retained. Accordingly, the obligation to retain those data constituted in itself an interference with the right to respect for private life and communications guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the right to protection of personal data under its Article 8. Furthermore, the access of the competent national authorities to the data constituted a further interference with those fundamental rights. The CJEU further held that the interference was particularly serious. The fact that data were retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed was likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives were the subject of constant surveillance. The interference satisfied an objective of general interest, namely to contribute to the fight against serious crime and terrorism and thus, ultimately, to public security. However, it failed to satisfy the requirement of proportionality. Firstly, the Directive covered, in a generalised manner, all persons and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime. It therefore entailed an interference with the fundamental rights of practically the entire European population. It applied even to persons for whom there was no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious crime. Secondly, the Directive did not contain substantive and procedural conditions relating to the access of the competent national authorities to the data and to their subsequent use. By simply referring, in a general manner, to serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law, the Directive failed to lay down any objective criterion by which to determine which offences might be considered to be sufficiently serious to justify such an extensive interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Above all, the access by the competent national authorities to the data retained was not made dependent on a prior review carried out by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision sought to limit access to the data and their use to what was strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued. Thirdly, the Directive required that all data be retained for a period of at least six months, without any distinction being made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The CJEU concluded that the Directive entailed a wide-ranging and particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, without such an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it was actually limited to what was strictly necessary. The CJEU also noted that the Directive did not provide for sufficient safeguards, by means of technical and organisational measures, to ensure effective protection of the data retained against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of those data.",

Further, as far as the OSAA was concerned, the Constitutional Court had already examined its constitutionality on a number of occasions and had found that it was compatible with the Constitution.

Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 56, ECHR 2002 ‑ X; Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria (no. 4), no. 72331/01, § 26, 9 November 2006; and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v.

In Klass and Others the Court held that an individual might, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege that such measures had in fact been applied to him. The relevant conditions were to be determined in each case according to the Convention right or rights alleged to have been infringed, the secret character of the measures objected to, and the connection between the applicant and those measures (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 34 ). The Court explained the reasons for its approach as follows.",

The Court points out that where a State institutes secret surveillance the existence of which remains unknown to the persons being controlled, with the effect that the surveillance remains unchallengeable, Article 8 could to a large extent be reduced to a nullity. It is possible in such a situation for an individual to be treated in a manner contrary to Article 8, or even to be deprived of the right granted by that Article, without his being aware of it and therefore without being able to obtain a remedy either at the national level or before the Convention institutions.",
                "The Court finds it unacceptable that the assurance of the enjoyment of a right guaranteed by the Convention could be thus removed by the simple fact that the person concerned is kept unaware of its violation.

To that extent, the disputed legislation directly affects all users or potential users of the postal and telecommunication services in the Federal Republic of Germany. Furthermore, as the Delegates rightly pointed out, this menace of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8.",

In order to assess, in a particular case, whether an individual can claim an interference as a result of the mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, the Court must have regard to the availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being applied to him. Where there is no possibility of challenging the alleged application of secret surveillance measures at domestic level, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified. In such cases, even where the actual risk of surveillance is low, there is a greater need for scrutiny by this Court (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124).",

In the Court ’ s view the Kennedy approach is best tailored to the need to ensure that the secrecy of surveillance measures does not result in the measures being effectively unchallengeable and outside the supervision of the national judicial authorities and of the Court. Accordingly, the Court accepts that an applicant can claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret surveillance measures, or legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, if the following conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the Court will take into account the scope of the legislation permitting secret surveillance measures by examining whether the applicant can possibly be affected by it, either because he belongs to a group of persons targeted by the contested legislation or because the legislation directly affects all users of communication services by instituting a system where any person can have his communications intercepted. Secondly, the Court will take into account the availability of remedies at the national level and will adjust the degree of scrutiny depending on the effectiveness of such remedies. As the Court observed in Kennedy, where the domestic system does not afford an effective remedy to the person who suspects that he was subjected to secret surveillance, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124). In such circumstances the threat of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8. There is therefore a greater need for scrutiny by the Court, and an exception to the rule denying individuals the right to challenge a law in abstracto is justified. In such cases the individual does not need to demonstrate the existence of any risk that secret surveillance measures were applied to him. By contrast, if the national system provides for effective remedies, a widespread suspicion of abuse is more difficult to justify. In such cases, the individual may claim to be a victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures only if he is able to show that, due to his personal situation, he is potentially at risk of being subjected to such measures."

The courts summarised their own case-law concerning operational-search measures involving interference with the privacy of communications or privacy of the home for the period from 2010 - 13. One of the courts noted that it refused authorisation to carry out an operational-search measure if it did not appear on the list of operational-search measures in the OSAA, if the request for authorisation was not signed by a competent official or was not reasoned, or if the case fell under statutory restrictions on the use of that measure (for example, relating to the person ’ s status or to the nature of the offence). Authorisation was given if all of the above conditions were met. Another court stated that authorisation could also be refused if the request was insufficiently reasoned, that is, if it did not contain sufficient information permitting the judge to ascertain that the measure was lawful and justified. The third court stated that it granted authorisation if requested to do so by the law-enforcement authorities. It never refused a request for authorisation. All three courts considered that the request was sufficiently reasoned if it referred to the existence of information listed in section 8(2) of the OSAA (see paragraph 31 above). One of the courts noted that supporting materials were never attached to requests for authorisation; another court noted that some, but not all, of the requests were accompanied by supporting materials, while the third court stated that all requests were accompanied by supporting materials. In all three courts the judges never requested that the law-enforcement authorities submit additional supporting materials, such as materials confirming the grounds for the interception or proving that the telephone numbers to be tapped belonged to the person concerned. Two courts granted interception authorisations in respect of unidentified persons, one of them specifying that such authorisations only concerned collection of data from technical channels of communication. Such authorisations did not mention a specific person or a telephone number to be tapped, but authorised interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence had been committed. One court never gave such authorisations. Two courts noted that authorisations always indicated the duration for which the interception was authorised, while one court stated that the duration of interception was not indicated in the authorisations issued by it.

The applicant drew the Court ’ s attention to the fact that the number of interception authorisations had almost doubled between 2009 and 2013. He also argued that the very high percentage of authorisations granted showed that the judges did not verify the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the interception subject and did not exercise careful and rigorous scrutiny.

An obligation to forward an interception authorisation to the communications service provider was mentioned only once in Russian law in connection with the monitoring of communications-related data under the CCrP (see paragraph 48 above ). The equipment the communications service providers had installed pursuant to the Orders issued by the Ministry of Communications, in particular the unpublished addendums to Order no. 70, allowed the law-enforcement authorities direct and unrestricted access to all mobile-telephone communications of all users. The communications service providers also had an obligation under Order no. 538 to create databases to store information about all subscribers and the services provided to them for three years. The secret services had direct remote access to those databases. The manner in which the system of secret surveillance thus operated gave the security services and the police the technical means to circumvent the authorisation procedure and to intercept any communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation. The necessity to obtain such authorisation therefore arose only in those cases where the intercepted data had to be used as evidence in criminal proceedings."

The officers were suspected of unlawfully intercepting the private communications of politicians and businessmen in return for bribes from their political or business rivals.

The OSAA explicitly required the courts to give reasons for the decision to authorise interception. In line with the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 8 February 2007 (see paragraph 42 above), the interception authorisation was to refer to the specific grounds for suspecting the person in respect of whom operational-search measures were requested of a criminal offence or of activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security.

In exceptional circumstances it was permissible to authorise the interception of communications of unidentified persons. As a rule, in such cases a judge authorised the collection of data from technical channels of communication in order to identify the persons present at a specific location at the time that a criminal offence was committed there.

Compensation for non-pecuniary damage was determined in accordance with the rules set out in Articles 1099 to 1101 of the Civil Code ( see paragraphs 103 - 04 above ). The Government observed, in particular, that non-pecuniary damage caused through dissemination of information which was damaging to honour, dignity or reputation could be compensated irrespective of the tortfeasor ’ s fault. The Government submitted a copy of a decision of 9 December 2013 by the Vichuga Town Court of the Ivanovo region, awarding compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage for unlawful interception of a suspect ’ s telephone conversations after the recordings obtained as a result of that interception had been declared inadmissible as evidence by the trial court.

Foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance, such as the interception of communications, cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures ( see Malone, cited above, § 67; Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 51, Series A no. 116; Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ B; Valenzuela Contreras v.

Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among other authorities, Malone, cited above, § 68; Leander, cited above, § 51; Huvig, cited above, § 29; and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 94)."

As to the question whether an interference was “necessary in a democratic society” in pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court has acknowledged that, when balancing the interest of the respondent State in protecting its national security through secret surveillance measures against the seriousness of the interference with an applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life, the national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in choosing the means for achieving the legitimate aim of protecting national security. However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance set up to protect national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 49 - 50 and 59; Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 106; Kvasnica v.

Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his rights. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 55 - 56)."

There is in principle little scope for recourse to the courts by the individual concerned unless the latter is advised of the measures taken without his knowledge and thus able to challenge their legality retrospectively (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 5 7, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135) or, in the alternative, unless any person who suspects that his communications are being or have been intercepted can apply to courts, so that the courts ’ jurisdiction does not depend on notification to the interception subject that there has been an interception of his communications (see Kennedy, cited above, § 167).",

The “ quality of law ” in this sense implies that the domestic law must not only be accessible and foreseeable in its application, it must also ensure that secret surveillance measures are applied only when “necessary in a democratic society”, in particular by providing for adequate and effective safeguards and guarantees against abuse."

Regrettably, the OSAA does not contain such a requirement ( ibid .).

It must also ascertain whether the requested interception meets the requirement of “ necessity in a democratic society”, as provided by Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, including whether it is proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, by verifying, for example, whether it is possible to achieve the aims by less restrictive means (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 51; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § § 79 - 80; Iordachi and Others, cited above, § 51; and Kennedy, cited above, §§ 31 - 32)."

Thus, materials containing information about undercover agents or police informers or about the organisation and tactics of operational-search measures may not be submitted to the judge and are therefore excluded from the court ’ s scope of review (see paragraph 37 above). The Court considers that the failure to disclose the relevant information to the courts deprives them of the power to assess whether there is a sufficient factual basis to suspect the person in respect of whom operational-search measures are requested of a criminal offence or of activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security (see, mutatis mutandis, Liu, cited above, §§ 59-63). The Court has earlier found that there are techniques that can be employed which both accommodate legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 131, Reports 1996 ‑ V )."

At the same time, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court has explained in its decisions that the burden of proof is on the requesting agency to show that interception is necessary and that the judge examining an interception request should verify the grounds for that measure and grant authorisation only if he is persuaded that interception is lawful, necessary and justified. The Constitutional Court has also held that the judicial decision authorising interception should contain reasons and refer to specific grounds for suspecting that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed, or is being plotted or that activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security are being carried out, as well as that the person in respect of whom interception is requested is involved in these criminal or otherwise dangerous activities (see paragraphs 40 - 42 above).

Indeed, the materials submitted by the applicant show that the domestic courts do not always follow the above - mentioned recommendations of the Constitutional Court, all of which were contained in decisions rather than in judgments. Thus, it transpires from the analytical notes issued by District Courts that interception requests are often not accompanied by any supporting materials, that the judges of these District Courts never request the interception agency to submit such materials and that a mere reference to the existence of information about a criminal offence or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security is considered to be sufficient for the authorisation to be granted. An interception request is rejected only if it is not signed by a competent person, contains no reference to the offence in connection with which interception is to be ordered, or concerns a criminal offence in respect of which interception is not permitted under domestic law ( see paragraph 193 above). Thus, the analytical notes issued by District Courts, taken together with the statistical information for the period from 2009 - 13 provided by the applicant (see paragraph 194 above), indicate that in their everyday practice Russian courts do not verify whether there is a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned and do not apply the “ necessity ” and “ proportionality ” test."

By contrast, the OSAA does not contain any requirements either with regard to the content of the request for interception or to the content of the interception authorisation. As a result, courts sometimes grant interception authorisations which do not mention a specific person or telephone number to be tapped, but authorise interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence has been committed. Some authorisations do not mention the duration for which interception is authorised (see paragraph 193 above). The Court considers that such authorisations, which are not clearly prohibited by the OSAA, grant a very wide discretion to the law ‑ enforcement authorities as to which communications to intercept, and for how long."

A judge must be informed of any such case within twenty-four hours from the commencement of the interception. If no judicial authorisation has been issued within forty-eight hours, the interception must be stopped immediately (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has already examined the “urgency” procedure provided for in Bulgarian law and found that it was compatible with the Convention ( see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § § 16 and 82). However, in contrast to the Bulgarian provision, the Russian “ urgent procedure ” does not provide for sufficient safeguards to ensure that it is used sparingly and only in duly justified cases. Thus, although in the criminal sphere the OSAA limits recourse to the urgency procedure to cases where there exists an immediate danger that a serious or especially serious offence may be committed, it does not contain any such limitations in respect of secret surveillance in connection with events or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security. Domestic law does not limit the use of the urgency procedure to cases involving an immediate serious danger to national, military, economic or ecological security. It leaves the authorities an unlimited degree of discretion in determining in which situations it is justified to use the non-judicial urgent procedure, thereby creating possibilities for abusive recourse to it ( ibid. ). Furthermore, although Russian law requires that a judge be immediately informed of each instance of urgent interception, his power is limited to authorising the extension of the interception measure beyond forty-eight hours. He has no power to assess whether the use of the urgent procedure was justified or to decide whether the material obtained during the previous forty-eight hours is to be kept or destroyed (see, by contrast, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 16). Russian law does not therefore provide for an effective judicial review of the urgency procedure."

Indeed, pursuant to Orders issued by the Ministry of Communications, in particular the addendums to Order no. 70, communications service providers must install equipment giving the law ‑ enforcement authorities direct access to all mobile-telephone communications of all users (see paragraphs 115 - 22 above). The communications service providers also have an obligation under Order no. 538 to create databases storing information about all subscribers, and the services provided to them, for three years; the secret services have direct remote access to those databases (see paragraphs 132 - 33 above ).

The prohibition on logging or recording interceptions set out in Russian law makes it impossible for the supervising authority to discover interceptions carried out without proper judicial authorisation. Combined with the law-enforcement authorities ’ technical ability, pursuant to the same Order, to intercept directly all communications, this provision renders any supervision arrangements incapable of detecting unlawful interceptions and therefore ineffective."

In the framework of their prosecuting functions, prosecutors give their approval to all interception requests lodged by investigators in the framework of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 44 above).

It is, however, important to note that information about the security services ’ undercover agents, and about the tactics, methods and means used by them, is outside the scope of prosecutors ’ supervision (see paragraph 74 above ).

Moreover, interceptions performed by the FSB in the sphere of counter - intelligence may be inspected only following an individual complaint (see paragraph 76 above ).

In Russia, prosecutors must submit biannual reports detailing the results of the inspections to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. However, these reports concern all types of operational-search measures, amalgamated together, without interceptions being treated separately from other measures.

Subsequent notification to each individual affected by a suspended measure might well jeopardise the long-term purpose that originally prompted the surveillance. Furthermore, such notification might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents. Therefore, the fact that persons concerned by secret surveillance measures are not subsequently notified once surveillance has ceased cannot by itself warrant the conclusion that the interference was not “necessary in a democratic society”, as it is the very absence of knowledge of surveillance which ensures the efficacy of the interference. As soon as notification can be carried out without jeopardising the purpose of the restriction after the termination of the surveillance measure, information should, however, be provided to the persons concerned (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135).

In Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev and Dumitru Popescu, the Court found that the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point was incompatible with the Convention, in that it deprived the interception subject of an opportunity to seek redress for unlawful interferences with his Article 8 rights and rendered the remedies available under the national law theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective. The national law thus eschewed an important safeguard against the improper use of special means of surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 90 - 91, and Dumitru Popescu, cited above, § 77). By contrast, in Kennedy the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point in time was compatible with the Convention, because in the United Kingdom any person who suspected that his communications were being or had been intercepted could apply to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, whose jurisdiction did not depend on notification to the interception subject that there had been an interception of his communications (see Kennedy, cited above, § 167)."

It follows that access to the information is conditional on the person ’ s ability to prove that his communications were intercepted. Furthermore, the interception subject is not entitled to obtain access to documents relating to interception of his communications; he is at best entitled to receive “information” about the collected data.

The Court will examine them in turn."

                "294. The first of the procedures invoked by the Government is an appeal, cassation appeal or supervisory-review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications. However, the Constitutional Court stated clearly that the interception subject had no right to appeal against the judicial decision authorising interception of his communications (see paragraph 40 above; see also Avanesyan, cited above, § 30 ). Domestic law is silent on the possibility of lodging a cassation appeal. Given that the Government did not submit any examples of domestic practice on examination of cassation appeals, the Court has serious doubts as to the existence of a right to lodge a cassation appeal against a judicial decision authorising interception of communications. At the same time, the interception subject is clearly entitled to lodge a supervisory - review complaint (see paragraph 43 above ). However, in order to lodge a supervisory - review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications, the person concerned had to be aware that such a decision existed. Although the Constitutional Court has held that it is not necessary to attach a copy of the contested judicial decision to the supervisory - review complaint ( ibid. ), it is difficult to imagine how a person can lodge such a complaint without having at least the minimum information about the decision he is challenging, such as its date and the court which has issued it. In the absence of notification of surveillance measures under Russian law, an individual would hardly ever be able to obtain that information unless it were to be disclosed in the context of criminal proceedings against him or there was some indiscretion which resulted in disclosure."

Further, a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP may be lodged only by a participant to criminal proceedings while a pre-trial investigation is pending (see paragraphs 88 - 89 above ). This remedy is therefore available only to persons who have learned of the interception of their communications in the framework of criminal proceedings against them. It cannot be used by a person against whom no criminal proceedings have been brought following the interception of his communications and who does not know whether his communications were intercepted. It is also worth noting that the Government did not submit any judicial decisions examining a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP concerning the interception of communications. They therefore failed to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedy invoked by them with examples from the case-law of the domestic courts (see, for similar reasoning, Rotaru, cited above, § 70, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, §§ 109 - 10)."

As regards the judicial - review complaint under the Judicial Review Act, Chapter 25 of the CCP and the new Code of Administrative Procedure and a civil tort claim under Article 1069 of the Civil Code, the burden of proof is on the claimant to show that the interception has taken place and that his rights were thereby breached (see paragraphs 85, 95 - 96 and 105 above ). In the absence of notification or some form of access to official documents relating to the interceptions, such a burden of proof is virtually impossible to satisfy. Indeed, the applicant ’ s judicial complaint was rejected by the domestic courts on the ground that he had failed to prove that his telephone communications had been intercepted (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). The Court notes that the Government submitted several judicial decisions taken under Chapter 25 of the CCP or Article 1069 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 220 - 23 above). However, all of those decisions, with one exception, concern searches or seizures of documents or objects, that is, operational-search measures carried out with the knowledge of the person concerned. Only one judicial decision concerns interception of communications. In that case the intercept subject was able to discharge the burden of proof because she had learned of the interception of her communications in the course of criminal proceedings against her."

            [
                "297. Further, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that Russian law provides for criminal remedies for abuse of power, unauthorised collection or dissemination of information about a person ’ s private and family life and breach of citizens ’ right to privacy of communications. For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs these remedies are also available only to persons who are capable of submitting to the prosecuting authorities at least some factual information about the interception of their communications (see paragraph 24 above)."
            ],
            [
                "298. The Court concludes from the above that the remedies referred to by the Government are available only to persons who are in possession of information about the interception of their communications. Their effectiveness is therefore undermined by the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point, or an adequate possibility of requesting and obtaining information about interceptions from the authorities. Accordingly, the Court finds that Russian law does not provide for an effective judicial remedy against secret surveillance measures in cases where no criminal proceedings were brought against the interception subject. It is not the Court ’ s task in the present case to decide whether these remedies will be effective in cases where an individual learns about the interception of his communications in the course of criminal proceedings against him (see, however, Avanesyan, cited above, where some of these remedies were found to be ineffective in order to complain of an “inspection” of the applicant ’ s flat)."

                "299. Lastly, with respect to the remedies to challenge the alleged insufficiency of safeguards against abuse in Russian law before the Russian courts, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that such remedies are effective (see paragraphs 156 and 225 above). As regards the possibility of challenging the OSAA before the Constitutional Court, the Court observes that the Constitutional Court has examined the constitutionality of the OSAA on many occasions and found that it was compatible with the Constitution (see paragraphs 40 - 43, 50, 82 and 85 - 87 above). In such circumstances the Court finds it unlikely that a complaint by the applicant to the Constitutional Court, raising the same issues that have already been examined by it, would have any prospect of success. Nor is the Court convinced that a challenge of Order no. 70 before the Supreme Court or the lower courts would constitute an effective remedy. Indeed, the applicant did challenge Order no. 70 in the domestic proceedings. However, both the District and City Courts found that the applicant had no standing to challenge the Order because the equipment installed pursuant to it did not in itself interfere with the privacy of his communications (see paragraphs 10 ‑ 11 and 13 above). It is also significant that the Supreme Court found that Order no. 70 was technical rather than legal in nature (see paragraph 128 above)."
            ],

                "300. In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that Russian law does not provide for effective remedies to a person who suspects that he has been subjected to secret surveillance. By depriving the subject of interception of the effective possibility of challenging interceptions retrospectively, Russian law thus eschews an important safeguard against the improper use of secret surveillance measures."
            ],

            [
                "302. The Court concludes that Russian legal provisions governing interceptions of communications do not provide for adequate and effective guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse which is inherent in any system of secret surveillance, and which is particularly high in a system where the secret services and the police have direct access, by technical means, to all mobile-telephone communications. In particular, the circumstances in which public authorities are empowered to resort to secret surveillance measures are not defined with sufficient clarity. Provisions on discontinuation of secret surveillance measures do not provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference. Domestic law permits automatic storage of clearly irrelevant data and is not sufficiently clear as to the circumstances in which the intercept material will be stored and destroyed after the end of a trial. The authorisation procedures are not capable of ensuring that secret surveillance measures are ordered only when “necessary in a democratic society”. The supervision of interceptions, as it is currently organised, does not comply with the requirements of independence, powers and competence which are sufficient to exercise an effective and continuous control, public scrutiny and effectiveness in practice. The effectiveness of the remedies is undermined by the absence of notification at any point of interceptions, or adequate access to documents relating to interceptions."

It is significant that the shortcomings in the legal framework as identified above appear to have an impact on the actual operation of the system of secret surveillance which exists in Russia.

The examples submitted by the applicant in the domestic proceedings ( see paragraph 12 above) and in the proceedings before the Court ( see paragraph 197 above) indicate the existence of arbitrary and abusive surveillance practices, which appear to be due to the inadequate safeguards provided by law (see, for similar reasoning, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 92; and, by contrast, Klass and Others, cited above, § 59, and Kennedy, cited above, §§ 168 - 69)."

This conclusion is in no way invalidated by the powers conferred on the Commission under Article 27 (art. 27) of the Convention as regards the admissibility of applications. The task which this Article assigns to the Commission is one of sifting; the Commission either does or does not accept the applications. Its decision to reject applications which it considers to be inadmissible are without appeal as are, moreover, also those by which applications are accepted; they are taken in complete independence (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, pp. 29 and 30, paras. 47-54; see also the judgment of 9 February 1967 on the preliminary objection in the \"Belgian Linguistic\" case, Series A no. 5, p. 18; the Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 20, para. 41; and the judgment of 18 January 1978 in the case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom, Series A no. 25, p. 63, para. 157).",

Thus, in contrast to the position under Article 24 (art. 24) - where, subject to the other conditions laid down, the general interest attaching to the observance of the Convention renders admissible an inter-State application - Article 25 (art. 25) requires that an individual applicant should claim to have been actually affected by the violation he alleges (see the judgment of 18 January 1978 in the case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom, Series A no. 25, pp. 90-91, paras. 239 and 240). Article 25 (art. 25) does not institute for individuals a kind of actio popularis for the interpretation of the Convention; it does not permit individuals to complain against a law in abstracto simply because they feel that it contravenes the Convention. In principle, it does not suffice for an individual applicant to claim that the mere existence of a law violates his rights under the Convention; it is necessary that the law should have been applied to his detriment. Nevertheless, as both the Government and the Commission pointed out, a law may by itself violate the rights of an individual if the individual is directly affected by the law in the absence of any specific measure of implementation. In this connection, the Court recalls that, in two previous cases originating in applications lodged in pursuance of Article 25 (art. 25), it has itself been faced with legislation having such an effect: in the \"Belgian Linguistic\" case and the case of Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, the Court was called on to examine the compatibility with the Convention and Protocol No. 1 of certain legislation relating to education (see the judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6, and the judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23, especially pp. 22-23, para. 48)."

It is possible in such a situation for an individual to be treated in a manner contrary to Article 8 (art. 8), or even to be deprived of the right granted by that Article (art. 8), without his being aware of it and therefore without being able to obtain a remedy either at the national level or before the Convention institutions.",

These conditions are not fulfilled since, according to the applicants ’ own submissions, it is only by an act on the part of the executive that their fundamental rights would be violated. However, because they are not apprised of the interference with their rights, the persons concerned cannot challenge any implementary measure. In such cases, they must be entitled to make a constitutional application against the Act itself, as in cases where a constitutional application against an implementary measure is impossible for other reasons ...\"",

To that extent, the disputed legislation directly affects all users or potential users of the postal and telecommunication services in the Federal Republic of Germany.

Consequently, as the minority in the Commission stated, it cannot be a prerequisite for the application of Article 13 (art. 13) that the Convention be in fact violated. In the Court ’ s view, Article 13 (art. 13) requires that where an individual considers himself to have been prejudiced by a measure allegedly in breach of the Convention, he should have a remedy before a national authority in order both to have his claim decided and, if appropriate, to obtain redress. Thus Article 13 (art. 13) must be interpreted as guaranteeing an \"effective remedy before a national authority\" to everyone who claims that his rights and freedoms under the Convention have been violated."

Rather, their complaint is directed against what they consider to be a shortcoming in the content of the contested legislation. While conceding that some forms of recourse exist in certain circumstances, they contend that the legislation itself, since it prevents them from even knowing whether their rights under the Convention have been interfered with by a concrete measure of surveillance, thereby denies them in principle an effective remedy under national law. Neither the Commission nor the Government agree with this contention. Consequently, although the applicants are challenging the terms of the legislation itself, the Court must examine, inter alia, what remedies are in fact available under German law and whether these remedies are effective in the circumstances."

Admittedly, that Court examined the applicants ’ complaints with reference not to the Convention but solely to the Basic Law.

Secret surveillance and its implications are facts that the Court, albeit to its regret, has held to be necessary, in modern-day conditions in a democratic society, in the interests of national security and for the prevention of disorder or crime (see paragraph 48 above). The Convention is to be read as a whole and therefore, as the Commission indicated in its report, any interpretation of Article 13 (art. 13) must be in harmony with the logic of the Convention. The Court cannot interpret or apply Article 13 (art. 13) so as to arrive at a result tantamount in fact to nullifying its conclusion that the absence of notification to the person concerned is compatible with Article 8 (art. 8) in order to ensure the efficacy of surveillance measures (see paragraphs 58 to 60 above).

Sub-paragraph (b) provided, in addition to the on-site visit and review of the taxpayer’s assets, a legal basis for the imposition of a review of the company’s archives. With the exception of the rule on review of archives (“ arkivgjennomsyn ”) in sub-paragraph (b), those provisions were essentially a continuation of the earlier ones of the Taxation Act on the duty to provide information and allow special inspections. Since the rule on review of archives had been added during the consideration of the Bill by the Parliamentary Committee on Financial Matters’, the preparatory work had been rather sparse. On the other hand, the Committee had pointed out that an order to produce a document pursuant to sub ‑ paragraph (a) presupposed knowledge about the existence of the document, and that the refusal to allow access to review archives constituted a hindrance to effective inspection."

The duty to produce documents was not limited to accountancy documents. What was decisive was whether the documents were significant for the taxpayer’s tax assessment and the authorities’ review of the latter.

The aim of an inspection was to find out whether an archive contained documents that could be significant for tax assessment purposes. Access should therefore comprise all archives which the tax authorities had reason to assume contained information of significance for the tax assessment, not just those archives or parts of archives that included accountancy material. In the interests of efficiency of the tax audit, access at that stage should be relatively wide. Therefore, the companies’ argument that it should be up to each tax subject to give binding indications as to which parts of the archive contained documents of significance for the tax assessment or the audit had to be rejected."

Measures taken under Chapter 4 of the Tax Assessment Act formed part of ordinary administrative procedures with a view to ensuring that a correct tax assessment was made. An accountancy audit could be initiated independently of any suspicion of the commission of a criminal offence. An order imposed pursuant to section 4-10 also involved compulsion of a different character than enforcement measures (“ tvangsmidler ”) in the context of criminal proceedings, where the prosecution executed the measure by way of enforcement (“ tvangsgjennomføring ”). The principle of the duty to submit tax returns, supplemented by the tax subject’s duty to provide information under section 4-2, presupposed that it should be possible to verify and depart from the information provided by the tax subject. The consequences of a tax subject’s refusal to cooperate were exclusively administrative (discretionary tax assessment)."

The problem arose where it was not possible, at least in advance, to ascertain whether the respective parts were clearly separated, typically where the data were stored electronically on a common server.

However, it followed from the facts established by the High Court that B.L.H. did not have its own administration but was serviced by a small number of persons in Bergen Underwater Services AS located at the same address, as was the situation of the other companies using the server in question which was owned and run by Kver.

The archive was not organised with clear separations between the different companies, and the distinction between each service person’s user area was not such as to enable the tax authorities to identify information of significance for the tax assessment. In this situation, the High Court had correctly considered that the tax authorities could not depend on B.L.H. indicating the files that might be relevant for the tax assessment of the company. Therefore, the authorities ought to be vested with powers to review all the data on the server.

Unlike sub-paragraph (a), which expressly stated different alternatives for access to documents, sub-paragraph (b) made no mention of how the review should take place.

In the view of Mrs Justice Stabel, it was difficult to see that this could be the case. Indeed, the inspection as such would be less burdensome in that the tax subject would at no time be deprived of access to the archive. The requisite safeguards were preserved as the tax subject had a right, under section 3 ‑ 5 (1) of the Tax Assessment Act, to be notified about and to be present during the authorities’ review of the tape. If the measure was the subject of a complaint, the material had to be sealed pending examination of the complaint (section 3-6 (4)).

If the tax authorities were allowed to demand a copy of the archive, they would in reality be empowered to seize, a power which the majority in Parliament in 1984 had not wished to give them when removing a provision to that effect before the entry into force of the relevant part of the Tax Assessment Act."

He agreed with the majority that the right to review archives under section 4-10 (1) (b) comprised not only archives containing accountancy material but all archives that potentially contained documents of significance for the tax assessment. This meant that the archived material which the tax authorities could demand to review included a great quantity of sensitive personal data. If the tax authorities were to be empowered to demand the copying of archives, the risk of dissemination and abuse of sensitive personal data would increase considerably beyond what followed from a review on the taxpayer’s premises. This applied especially to the copying of electronic archives. The search facilities for an electronic archive were different from those used for a traditional paper-based archive. Even if electronically stored data were deleted, they could be reconstructed. Also, electronically stored data might be disseminated far more easily and effectively than information on paper. The right of the tax subject to be present when the tax authorities opened and reviewed the archive did not constitute a guarantee against abuse. There was no way of ensuring that that right had been respected. Therefore, weighty considerations of legal security and protection of privacy militated against conferring on the tax authorities a right to demand a copy of the archive. As the majority in Parliament had pointed out in the context of the legislative amendment in 1984, the requirements of legal security and protection of privacy were an overriding political aim in a democratic society. In particular, since the parliamentary majority had voted strongly against search and seizure, and since copying for subsequent review at the tax office was in reality a form of seizure, Mr Justice Skogøy found that the tax authorities clearly should not be empowered to require a copy without the question being first considered by the legislator and a clear statutory power given for copying."

There had been no effective safeguards against abuse. In any event, the interference could not be considered strictly proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. A significant proportion of the seized backup tape had contained information that was irrelevant for tax audit purposes and had included private material pertaining to employees and other persons working for the applicant companies.

That issue was now the subject of their complaint to the Court. Referring to their written pleadings before the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 31-37 above) and also to certain parts of the High Court’s reasoning (see paragraph 30 above), they stressed that they had clearly raised before the national courts the matter they were now pursuing under the Convention.

In this connection they argued inter alia that contrary to Article 8 of the Convention the inspection lacked a legal basis in national law and that the copying could not be justified as proportionate or “necessary” for the purposes of this provision (see paragraphs 32-36 above). In their additional written pleadings the applicant companies further clarified that their arguments drawn from Article 8 of the Convention were not new but had been raised previously (see paragraph 37 above).

Thus, the Court is satisfied that the applicant companies’ grievances were sufficiently raised, expressly or in substance, to enable the Supreme Court to consider the matters now complained of under the Convention. Indeed, the Supreme Court did take the opportunity, albeit without reference to Article 8 of the Convention, to assess the applicable safeguards of various interests, including those in place for the protection of privacy ( personvernhensyn ).

This had clearly not been the situation in respect of employees of and people working for the applicant companies, whose family pictures, private and professional correspondence as well as numerous work-related documents that were not relevant to the tax audit had been “seized” by the domestic authorities and thus exposed to them. Apart from the strong interest in protecting the privacy of their employees, contracting parties and other third parties, the applicant companies also had a legal obligation to protect personal data.

It concerned an administrative order to allow the inspection of records as part of a tax audit, not an order that had formed part of an investigation into unlawful practices, as in the French case.

Both B.L.H. and I.O.R., respectively the first and third applicant companies, rented space on the server, which was owned by Kver, the second applicant company. All three companies’ offices were in the same building. Although the disputed measure was not equivalent to a seizure imposed in criminal proceedings or enforceable on pain of criminal sanctions (see paragraph 43 above), the applicant companies were nonetheless under a legal obligation to comply with the order to enable such access. The imposition of that obligation on the applicant companies constituted an interference with their “home” and undoubtedly concerned their “correspondence” and material that could properly be regarded as such for the purposes of Article 8.

However, their order to hand over a backup tape on which all or most of the companies’ documents were kept had greatly exceeded the wording of that provision, from which no such power could be deduced. Nor could any support to that effect be found in case-law, the preparatory work on the legislation, legal doctrine or the tax authorities’ own guidelines. As had been pointed out by the minority of the Supreme Court, the provision was limited to “review”; to demand copies was far more interfering. When Parliament had authorised search and seizure in 1980, it had done so in order to ensure that important documents would not be hidden or deleted. If the authorities were to be empowered to copy the archive in question, it would mean conferring on them an authority over and above the intentions of Parliament in 1984 (see paragraph 58 above). The majority of the Supreme Court had ignored that fact in supporting the argument that the tax authorities should be permitted to “seize” electronic documents.

The present case did not concern any “grey areas at the fringes of the definition” (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V) but a far-reaching interference clearly outside the wording of the law and what could reasonably be deduced from the relevant legal sources. A number of factors indicated that the law was not sufficiently clear and precise. The tax authorities could easily have adhered to existing requirements by conducting the search on-site, limiting it to what was relevant for tax assessment purposes, and requiring the production of any documents necessary for those purposes. The fact that the “seizure” of the backup tape related to large amounts of data, including personal e-mails and lawyer-client correspondence, and affected the important interests of a wide group of persons, suggested a strict requirement of precision.

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Rotaru v.

Under sub-paragraph (b), the same authorities could order the taxpayer “[t]o grant access for on-site inspection, survey, or review of the companies’ archives ...”. For the reasons expounded by the Supreme Court in its judgment (see paragraphs 40-42 above), the Court sees no reason to question its interpretation that, having regard to the purpose of those provisions, electronically stored documents were also covered by sub-paragraph (a) (see similarly Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, cited above, §§ 53-54)."

To allow the authorities to access the entire server would therefore have been consistent with the above-mentioned purpose (see paragraphs 41-48 above). So would, in the view of the Supreme Court majority, a requirement enabling the authorities to obtain copies of documents where a review of those copies appeared expedient. Nothing in the relevant rules prevented either such copying (see paragraphs 51 above) or the taking of a backup copy of the server to the tax authorities’ premises for review there (see paragraphs 51-55 above).

It was not limited to accountancy documents but extended to all documents that might be relevant to the tax assessment (see paragraph 41 above). Considerations of efficiency of the tax audit suggested that the tax authorities’ possibilities to act should be relatively wide at the preparatory stage (see paragraph 42 above). The tax authorities could therefore not be bound by the tax subject’s indications as to which documents were relevant, even where the archive in question comprised documents belonging to other tax subjects.

In the instant case, sections 3-5 and 3-6 of the Tax Assessment Act, together with the right to judicial review, had provided the applicant companies with adequate and effective safeguards. Indeed, after they had complained about the section 4-10 (1) (b) order, the backup copy of the server had been sealed and the applicant companies had been granted an extension pursuant to section 3-6 (4) of the Tax Assessment Act. They had been granted a further extension pending a final and enforceable judgment and, subsequent to the Supreme Court judgment, yet a further extension in connection with legal proceedings on interim relief. Thus, whilst in most cases a backup tape would within a short time be reviewed in accordance with the section 4-10 (1) (b) order, in the present case the tax authorities had been in the possession of the backup tape for almost six years and had repeatedly agreed to defer their review of the tape."

Finland, 25 February 1997, §§ 94 and 99, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, and Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 58, Series A no. 116)."

There is no reason to call into doubt the view held by the Norwegian Parliament when adopting those provisions that the review of archives was a necessary means of ensuring efficiency in the checking of information which tax subjects submitted to the tax authorities, as well as greater accuracy in the information so provided and in the latter’s tax assessment (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above). Nor is there any reason to assume that the impugned application of section 4-10 (1) was based on any other considerations in the instant case. On the contrary, the tax authorities’ justification for obtaining access to the server and a backup copy with a view to carrying out a review of its contents on their premises was supported by reasons that were both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of the necessity test under Article 8 § 2."

Furthermore, it is to be noted that B.H.L. had been notified of the tax authorities’ intention to carry out a tax audit a year in advance, and both its representatives and those of Kver were present and able to express their views when the tax authorities made their on-site visit on 9 March 2004 (section 3-5 (1) of the Tax Assessment Act)."

They informed them of the dates, time and place of the review, its object, certain preparatory processing not involving searching or opening of documents, and the identity of the companies concerned.

However, it does not find that this gives rise to any serious cause for concern. As can be seen from the Tax Administration’s letter to the applicant companies of 30 April 2008, the constraints in this respect essentially stemmed from the mixed character of the archives and were designed to accommodate the applicant companies’ own wishes to respect confidentiality. Any documents selected would be listed, printed out and sorted according to company and be made accessible to the company in question for comment (see paragraph 65 above)."

As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners ’ correspondence.

Even the ordinary prison regime had caused his health to deteriorate. The fact that he used a wheelchair and had to live in the hospital wing of the prison had aggravated his suffering. Furthermore, application of the special regime had been extended on the ground that the applicant had not participated in the programmes of cooperation with the judicial process (he had not agreed to give evidence against his criminal associates).

                "55. In accordance with the Court ’ s settled case-law, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, § 24, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII; Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, § 37, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX; and Naumenko v. Ukraine, no. 42023/98, § 108, 10 February 2004). Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269 ). To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25, and Labita v.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be “inhuman” or “degrading”, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Jalloh v.

With particular reference to persons deprived of their liberty, Article 3 imposes a positive obligation on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Rivière v. France, no. 33834/03, § 62, 11 July 2006 ). Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 87, ECHR 2000-VII, and Naumenko, cited above, § 112 )."

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat ( see Mouisel, cited above, § 40 ), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well ‑ being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, § 76, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 38, 15 January 2004 )."

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, § 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a) the prisoner ’ s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, § 53, 2 December 2004, and Sakkopoulos, cited above, § 39).",

On three occasions, in January 2001 and in March and July 2002, the Naples court responsible for the execution of sentences, on the basis of the medical reports drawn up by the prison doctors, refused the applicant ’ s requests for a stay of execution of his sentence, taking the view that the care provided by the prison ’ s in-house medical service was appropriate to his state of health (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Argenti v.

It remains to be established whether the systematic interception of prisoners ’ correspondence envisaged by section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act was “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the Court observes that some measure of control over this correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment ( see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, § 98; and Campbell, cited above, p. 18, § 45). However, correspondence with lawyers, whether it concerns contemplated or pending proceedings or is of a general nature, is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § § 47 and 48 ). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner ’ s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as “ reasonable cause ” will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § 48)."

By contrast, section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act, as construed by the competent domestic authorities, calls for indiscriminate monitoring of the entirety of the prisoners ’ correspondence (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). It does not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners correspond. Nor does it, or the regulations for its application, lay down any rules – for instance, concerning time ‑ limits – governing the implementation of this monitoring. Moreover, the authorities are not bound to give any reasons in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Calogero Diana, cited above, p. 1775, § 32; Domenichini v.

Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court finds that the monitoring of the entirety of the applicant ’ s correspondence addressed to and coming from the outside world – including the letters to and from his lawyer – cannot be considered as corresponding to a pressing social need or proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Neither the competent domestic authorities, nor the Government have sought to explain why such all ‑ embracing monitoring was indispensable (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 21, 24 February 2005 ). On the contrary, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court voiced serious concerns in this regard (see paragraph 21 above)."

No such justification has been advanced in the instant case, either by the competent domestic authorities or by the Government in the proceedings before the Court.

They were told that this facility concerned parents, brothers and sisters, children and spouses. At the request of several inmates the warden apparently informally accepted to extend it to unmarried partners. At first the applicant, who before his incarceration had lived for about four years with Ms S.P. and had had a child with her just forty days before going to prison, was also able to benefit from the opportunity to call his partner on the telephone. However, in August 2001 the warden refused to allow him to avail himself of this facility. The applicant objected, but the warden replied that the law provided for a right to call spouses only and that if the applicant was so attached to his partner and their child, he could always marry her.

Concerning the first of these requirements, the Court observes that section 18(2) of the 1991 Bar Act, as in force at the relevant time, provided that the correspondence between lawyers and their clients was inviolable and could not be subject to interception (see paragraph 25 above). It does not seem that there exists any reported case ‑ law clarifying the exact purport of this provision and, in particular, how it interplayed with section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see, mutatis mutandis, Soini and Others v. Finland, no. 36404/97, §§ 55 in fine and 56, 17 January 2006). The Court further notes that in 2006 the Bulgarian Constitutional Court found that a provision whose wording was almost identical with that of section 33(1)(c) – the newly added section 132d(3) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act – was contrary to Articles 30 § 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above).

France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256 ‑ A, p. 23, § 51; Crémieux v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256 ‑ B, p. 61, § 34; and Miailhe v.

This is borne out by the wording of section 37(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraph 19 above). It can thus be said that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of “ the prevention of disorder or crime ” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2."

                "43. It remains to be established whether the systematic interception of prisoners ’ correspondence envisaged by section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act was “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the Court observes that some measure of control over this correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment ( see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, § 98; and Campbell, cited above, p. 18, § 45). However, correspondence with lawyers, whether it concerns contemplated or pending proceedings or is of a general nature, is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § § 47 and 48 ). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner ’ s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as “ reasonable cause ” will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § 48)."

By contrast, section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act, as construed by the competent domestic authorities, calls for indiscriminate monitoring of the entirety of the prisoners ’ correspondence (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). It does not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners correspond. Nor does it, or the regulations for its application, lay down any rules – for instance, concerning time ‑ limits – governing the implementation of this monitoring. Moreover, the authorities are not bound to give any reasons in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Calogero Diana, cited above, p. 1775, § 32; Domenichini v.

Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court finds that the monitoring of the entirety of the applicant ’ s correspondence addressed to and coming from the outside world – including the letters to and from his lawyer – cannot be considered as corresponding to a pressing social need or proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Neither the competent domestic authorities, nor the Government have sought to explain why such all ‑ embracing monitoring was indispensable (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 21, 24 February 2005 ). On the contrary, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court voiced serious concerns in this regard (see paragraph 21 above)."

Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47 095/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI (extracts); and Aliev v. Ukraine, no. 41220/98, § 187, 29 April 2003 ).

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 4 1488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ). Finally, the Court observes that telephone conversations, whether they be made from a person ’ s home or from other premises, are covered by the notions of “ private life ” and “ correspondence ” within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ III, p. 1016, § 44 ). Seeing that the person with whom the applicant wished to converse by telephone, Ms S.P., had been his unmarried partner for a number of years and had had a child with him, the prohibition to contact her by telephone undoubtedly affected the enjoyment of his right to respect for his private and family life, and as such fell within the ambit of Article 8.

It is true that the situations of unmarried and married couples are not fully analogous and that there still exist differences between them, in particular, differences in legal status and legal effects (see Shackell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45851/99, 27 April 2000, citing Lindsay v. the United Kingdom, no. 11089/84, Commission decision of 1 November 1986, Decisions and Reports 49, p. 181). The Court is also mindful that marriage remains an institution which is widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who enter it and, indeed, is singled out for special treatment under Article 12 of the Convention (ibid.). However, it fails to see any difference between the situations of inmates who wish to have telephone conversations with their spouses and inmates who wish to have such conversations with their unmarried partners with whom – like the applicant – they have an established family life. It therefore concludes that their situations are substantially similar in this regard."

No such justification has been advanced in the instant case, either by the competent domestic authorities or by the Government in the proceedings before the Court. The obtaining situation was the result of the wording of section 37a(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act and its particularly strict application by the prison authorities vis-à-vis the applicant in late 2001 and early 2002 (see paragraphs 16 and 24 above)."

                "38. As to the expression “in accordance with the law”, the court has established three fundamental principles. The first one is that the interference in question must have some basis in domestic law. The second principle is that “the law must be adequately accessible”, a person must be able to have an indication that is adequate, in the circumstances, of the legal rules applicable to his case. The third principle is that “a norm cannot be regarded as a ‘ law ’ unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable a person to regulate his conduct; he must be able ‑ if need be with appropriate advice ‑ to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail” (see the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, §§ 86-88)."

In determining whether an interference is \"necessary in a democratic society\" regard may be had to the State ’ s margin of appreciation (see, amongst other authorities, Campbell v. United Kingdom judgment, cited above, § 44). While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention.",

The Court has found that the applicable provisions of Polish law were adequately accessible. Furthermore, bearing in mind the impossibility of attaining absolute certainty in the framing of laws and the risk that the search for certainty may entail excessive rigidity, it has accepted that the provisions were formulated with sufficient precision.",

In the circumstances of the instant case, having regard to the fact that the applicant was indicted on charges of serious criminal offences and the need to secure the proper conduct of the trial, the interference could reasonably be considered as necessary in a democratic society.

They continued to seek access to S and protested to the Social Services Department at the refusal thereof; a meeting for them to see the child at the social services building was eventually arranged in July 1980. Having consulted solicitors in September with a view to challenging the Authority ’ s actions, the applicant and his wife were granted legal aid to apply to a juvenile court to discharge the Authority ’ s parental rights resolutions concerning S (see paragraph 40 below) and proceedings were issued on 4 November.

On 25 March, the judge permitted the Authority, which undertook to withdraw its appeal before the Divisional Court, to continue with the wardship proceedings; he directed that the case be heard as soon as possible and ordered that it be set down in the first week of June, no earlier date being available having regard to the expected length of the hearing."

In the leading case of A v. Liverpool City Council, the House of Lords examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities ’ statutory powers. Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions, notably on such matters as access to the child: the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise (except on judicial review principles; see paragraph 48 above) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute. Sometimes, however, the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court.",
                "The foregoing limits on the High Court ’ s powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care. If he is not, the High Court can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests."

The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order, requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify.

This is accordingly a domain in which there is an even greater call than usual for protection against arbitrary interferences.",

Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8 (art. 8).

This decision was approved by the Authority ’ s Adoption and Foster Care Committee on 31 March 1980.",

However, wardship proceedings instituted by the Authority immediately thereafter led to a High Court decision on 22 June 1981, confirmed by the Court of Appeal on 6 October 1981, that in S ’ s best interests and in view of the time that had elapsed he should remain with the foster parents with whom he had been placed in May 1980 and that the applicant and his wife should not have access to him.",

Yet, since S had previously been in voluntary care, those resolutions altered the whole basis of the legal relationship between him, his parents and the Authority. However, the applicant did not object to the resolution affecting him, seemingly because, albeit after the event, he reached an agreement with the Authority that S would be returned home within a few months (ibid.).",

On the other hand, there may well have been some discussion between them and the social workers about the possibility of placement with long-term foster parents, since on 31 March 1980 the social workers told the above-mentioned Committee that the parents disagreed with it (see paragraph 15 above); to this extent, therefore, their views were before the Authority, at least at that point of time. The applicant ’ s wife had also been warned as early as 22 January 1980 of the possibility that S might be placed in long-term care; however, the warning apparently did not refer to the prospect of adoption, was given when S ’ s return home was still envisaged and was not repeated at subsequent meetings between the parents and the social workers on 31 January and 14 February 1980 (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).",
                "(c) Finally, the Government did not deny that the applicant and his wife were not in any way consulted in advance regarding the decision of April 1980 to terminate their access to S (see paragraph 16 above). Nor apparently were they advised of that decision until the following month. This absence of involvement is all the more striking because the decision does not appear reconcilable with the Adoption and Foster Care Committee ’ s view that access should be restricted but not terminated (see paragraph 15 above)."

Again, when the English courts spoke of access as being a right in the child, they appear not to have been asserting the absence of any parental right of access whatsoever, but to have been expressing the principle that in the event of a conflict between concurrent rights of parent and child it is the welfare of the child which should be treated as the paramount consideration."

It is on the occurrence of some event that disturbs the ordinary pattern of family life by separating them - for example, matrimonial proceedings or the taking of a child into public care - that parental entitlement to access will become an issue in practice. It is therefore more important to focus on the position that obtains in English law in this respect once the relevant legislation has been brought into play."

            [
                "76. The raison d ’ être of the legislation concerning the taking of a child into public care is that, having regard to the background circumstances, the interests of the child may require that the local authority shall have parental powers for certain purposes. This result is achieved either by the making of a care order committing the child to the care of the local authority, in which event it will have nearly all the same powers and duties with respect to the child as his parent would have apart from the order, or by the adoption of a parental rights resolution, in which event there will vest in the authority nearly all the rights and duties which by law the parent has in relation to the child (see paragraphs 31 and 38 above).",
                "It is true that, in the case of a parental rights resolution, the rights which vest in the authority are specifically stated to include \"a right of access\" (see paragraph 38 above), but neither for that measure nor for a care order does the legislation stipulate in terms that there shall thenceforth be no contact between parent and child. The position in English law is that the taking of a child into public care by one of these means does not automatically deprive the parent of access to him; its effect is that the continuation of access becomes a matter within the discretionary power of the local authority (see paragraph 47 above)."
            ],
            [
                "77. The existence of a power on the part of the authority to decide to allow only restricted or even no visits to the child by his parent does not, in the Court ’ s understanding, necessarily mean that there is no longer any parental right in regard to access once one of the measures in question has been taken.",
                "As the Government accepted, the statutes clearly recognise the continuation of parental access as generally desirable (see paragraph 47 above). Moreover, the Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care issued in December 1983 (see paragraph 51 above) expressly acknowledges that for most children there will be no doubt that their interests will best be served by efforts to sustain links with their natural families. It would be inconsistent with this aim if the making of a care order or the adoption of a parental rights resolution were automatically to divest a natural parent of all further rights and duties in regard to access.",
                "The effect of these measures is not to extinguish all rights and responsibilities of the natural parent in respect of the child. Thus, for example, subject to the power of the court - and not the local authority - to dispense with his consent, he retains the right to agree or refuse to agree to the child ’ s adoption (see paragraphs 31, 38 and 52 above). Again, and even more importantly for the present purposes, he enjoys a continuing right to apply to the courts for the discharge of the order or resolution on the ground that such a course is in the child ’ s interests (see paragraphs 33 and 40 above). The issue for determination in such proceedings is the restoration of parental rights in regard to custody and control of the child. It would appear to the Court that the determination of a parental right is equally in issue where, during the currency of the order or resolution, a parent claims that the continuance or renewal of access is in the child ’ s interests. That this is so is now confirmed by the provisions of Part IA of the 1980 Act, inserted by the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983 (see paragraph 50 above), which are founded on the existence of just such a right on behalf of the parent.",
                "Moreover, the extinction of all parental right in regard to access would scarcely be compatible with fundamental notions of family life and the family ties which Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is designed to protect (see, amongst other authorities, the Marckx judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, § 45).",

On the other hand, this is an area in which it is essential to ensure that the rights of individual parents are protected in accordance with Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1).

However, as the Government accepted, proceedings of this kind are directed to the parental rights resolution as such and not to the isolated issue of access (see paragraph 48 above). Yet whether a child should be in public care and whether his parent should have access to him are matters to which different considerations may well apply. Again, the parent may have no desire to challenge the resolution, being content for the time being at least to see his contacts with his child maintained. Yet again, he may be able to adduce reasons warranting a continuation or restoration of access but not of his care of the child. Furthermore, a challenge of the resolution by the parent may prompt, on the part of the local authority, opposition which would not be forthcoming if the proceedings were confined to the access issue. If proceedings relating to access alone had been available to the applicant, he might have had recourse to them at a date earlier than that on which he actually instituted proceedings to challenge the resolution or with less opposition on the part of the Authority and thereby changed the whole future complexion of his relationship with S."

He alleged that he had handed over several complaints to a supervising prosecutor who had inspected the cells.

The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances or the victim ’ s behaviour (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, § 44, 20 July 2004, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 302 10/96, §§ 92-94, ECHR 2000-XI)."

The applicant was alternately held in thirty-square-metre cells housing ten inmates and smaller fifteen-square-metre cells accommodating six detainees.

The Court reiterates that in certain cases the lack of personal space afforded to detainees in Russian remand prisons was so extreme as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq. m of personal space (see, for example, Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, § § 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, §§ 47-49, 29 March 2007; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44, 16 June 2005 ). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four sq. m per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § § 70-72, ECHR 2001 ‑ III )."

This arrangement cut off any fresh air and also significantly reduced the amount of daylight that could penetrate into the cell. Moreover, densely spaced metal shutters fixed to the external wall barred access to daylight to a still greater extent.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief (see, among many other authorities, the judgment in Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 157, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI ). The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention.

It recalls that it has already found a violation of Article 13 on account of the absence of an effective remedy in respect of inhuman and degrading conditions of detention, concluding (see Benediktov v.

The Government have failed to submit evidence as to the existence of any domestic remedy by which the applicant could have complained about the general conditions of his detention, in particular with regard to the structural problem of overcrowding in Russian detention facilities, or that the remedies available to him were effective, that is to say that they could have prevented violations from occurring or continuing, or that they could have afforded the applicant appropriate redress (see, to the same effect, Melnik v.

Although the travel time did not exceed one hour, the Court considered such transport arrangements impermissible, irrespective of the duration. It also noted that the applicant in question had had to endure these cramped conditions twice a day on the two hundred days on which court hearings were held (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § § 118-120, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... (extracts) )."

                "93. On the facts, the Court observes that, save for thirteen times when the applicant was transported in a special van, he was brought to the court hearings in standard-issue prison vans on more than one hundred days. The passenger cabins of those vans were designed for the transportation of twenty-five detainees on a floor space measuring less than nine square metres, which left an area of approximately fifty by fifty centimetres for each detainee. The height of the cabin (1.6 m) was not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van. In addition to the already cramped conditions, it appears from the table compiled by the applicant that the van was occasionally occupied by a total number of detainees exceeding the design capacity (see paragraph 66 above). In their post-admissibility submission the Government relied on a report prepared in 2006 which purported to certify that the design capacity of prison vans had not been exceeded in 2001 or 2002 (see paragraph 64 above). This report is of little evidential value for the Court because it does not refer to any sources of information, such as registers of detainees or other records, on the basis of which it was compiled and by which that assertion could be verified. Moreover, other domestic documents which are less remote in time from the period under consideration than the report drafted in 2006 convince the Court otherwise. Thus, it appears that overcrowding of prison vans transporting prisoners in Moscow in 2002 was one of the problems reported by the authority in charge of remand centres as a result of an inquiry carried out in 2003 (see the letter of 26 November 2003 from the head of the Moscow Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, cited in Starokadomskiy v. Russia (dec.), no. 42239/02, 12 January 2006 )."

The Government indicated that the heating and lighting systems were only operational when the engine was running. Given that there were no windows or other openings giving access to natural light, the detainees remained in darkness – and, occasionally, in the cold – once the engine was stopped. Natural ventilation through the emergency hatches was obviously inadequate on hot days, given the cramped conditions inside the van."

The Government acknowledged that the travel time each way had been as long as two or three hours. According to the table the applicant produced, the aggregate travel time on any given day had been in the range of five to eight hours. Whereas it is impossible to establish with absolute certainty the duration of a journey on every occasion, what is important for the Court ’ s assessment is that the time spent by the applicant in the van was far from negligible and lasted on average six hours per day."

Permission to take one ’ s own food cannot substitute for appropriate catering arrangements, because it is primarily the State that is responsible for the well-being of persons deprived of their liberty. Besides, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s assertion that the applicant could eat breakfast and dinner at the remand centre on such days. It follows from the table compiled by the applicant that he had been often taken to the “waiting cubicle” before breakfast time and that he had returned to the remand centre too late for dinner.

The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kudła, cited above, § 92)."

The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s claim that the delays were primarily caused by the applicant ’ s lawyers. It notes that the applicant studied the case-file from 12 January to 13 July 2001, that is for six months, which does not appear excessive given the volume of the case-file. On the other hand, the proceedings were delayed owing to the conduct of the domestic authorities. After the case had been submitted for trial in July 2001, the trial would not be able to begin for almost one year because of the domestic courts ’ disagreement on the existence of defects in the investigation documents and the need for further investigative actions. Having regard to the above circumstances, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings in case no. 9307 exceeded a “reasonable time” (compare Korshunov v.

Such restrictions as limitations imposed on the number of family visits, supervision over those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visit arrangements constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision. Nevertheless, any restriction of that kind must be applied “in accordance with the law”, must pursue one or more legitimate aims listed in paragraph 2 and, in addition, must be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see, among other authorities, Estrikh v.

The Government ’ s claim that in 1999 he had been allowed to meet his wife in the presence of police officers was not supported by any evidence.

The interference was based on section 18 of the Custody Act and the Internal Rules for Remand Centres which provided for investigator ’ s discretion to authorise up to two family visits per month (see paragraphs 72 and 73 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the refusal of family visits had a basis in domestic law. It reiterates, however, that the expression “in accordance with the law” does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, Lupsa v. Romania, no. 10337/04, §§ 32 and 34, ECHR 2006-...., and Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 119, 20 June 2002)."

However, they fell short of the requirement of foreseeability because they conferred unfettered discretion on the investigator in this matter but did not define the circumstances in which a family visit could be refused. The impugned provisions went no further than mentioning the possibility of refusing family visits, without saying anything about the length of the measure or the reasons that may warrant its application. No mention was made of the possibility of challenging the refusal to issue an authorisation or whether a court was competent to rule on such a challenge (see also the Court ’ s findings below under Article 13 of the Convention). It follows that the provisions of Russian law governing family visits did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities, so that the applicant did not enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (compare Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 100, 13 September 2005, and Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, §§ 32-33).

Whereas section 17 § 18 of the Custody Act explicitly provided for a prisoner ’ s right to enter into civil transactions, paragraph 12.11 of the Internal Rules contained a more detailed regulation of the procedure for issuing a form of authority.

Mann), received information that an armed robbery of a Securicor Ltd cash-collection van was going to be committed on or around 2 March 1995 by the first applicant and B. at one of several possible locations. The police knew where B. lived and began visual surveillance of those same premises the same day. D.I. Mann learnt that B. was suspected of being a drug dealer and that surveillance operations mounted against B. in the past had proved unsuccessful because they had been compromised. It was therefore concluded that B. was “surveillance-conscious”. B. was suspected of being responsible for the shooting of a police officer with a shotgun in the course of a robbery. This was something that all the officers, and particularly the Chief Constable, were aware of when the police operation was being planned."

Further information as to the location or target of the proposed robbery could not be obtained on 3 March 1995. In order to obtain further details about the proposed robbery, D.I. Mann prepared a report for the Chief Constable in support of an application for authorisation to install a covert listening device in B.’s flat.

Judge Brodrick asked defence counsel whether they wanted him to put the unanswered questions to D.I. Mann under oath, in chambers, and they agreed. The judge proceeded to put the questions to D.I. Mann in private in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers. He heard evidence from D.I. Mann concerning the ability of the police to “control” B. in order to install the device in the flat, which the defence asserted indicated that normal methods of surveillance would have been possible. He also heard D.I. Mann concerning the arrangements made and put into effect for this period. The answers to those questions were not divulged, the judge indicating in open court that the benefit to the defence from the answers given was slight, if any at all, while the damage to the public interest if the answers were made public would be great.

At most there were one or possibly two breaches of procedure, but neither, in my judgment, could be described as either significant or substantial.

They conceded that the information was disclosed in accordance with the applicable domestic law (namely section 45 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and section 28(3) of the Data Protection Act 1984). However, neither, of these legislative provisions, nor any common-law rule, provided the safeguards envisaged in the Court’s case-law (see Khan, cited above, §§ 26-28; Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 1017, §§ 49-51; and Huvig v.

Equally, the Data Protection Act rendered personal data liable to disclosure for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime. Neither Act stipulated any of the restraints on abuse which, for instance, are to be found in the Police Act 1997 in relation to covert recordings.

The key issue in their view was whether the speaker knew or had any reason to suspect that the conversation was being recorded. In the present case, the police knew that the applicants had refused to provide voice samples voluntarily and sought to trick to them into speaking in an underhand procedure which was wholly unregulated, arbitrary and attended by bad faith. It was also irrelevant that the recording was used for forensic purposes rather than to obtain information about the speaker, as it was the covert recording itself, not the use made of it, which amounted to the breach of privacy."

In particular, the recordings made while they were being charged – a formal process of criminal justice, in the presence of at least one police officer – did not concern their private life. The applicants could have had no expectation of privacy in that context.

The measure was proportionate as it did not involve any act of trespass, the use of the samples was limited to identification and the applicants had the opportunity at trial to challenge their admissibility. Any interference was also conducted “in accordance with the law” as the making of the recordings after arrest was an exercise by the police of their normal common-law powers to obtain and store evidence and had not been found by the trial judge to contravene any requirements regarding cautioning or interview codes.",

France, judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 232-C, pp. 53-54, § 63; Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 28, § 24; Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 18-19, § 41; and Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 19 February 1997, Reports 1997-1, p. 131, § 36). Article 8 also protects a right to identity and personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v. Austria, judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, § 45). It may include activities of a professional or business nature (see Niemietz v. Germany, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251-B, pp. 33-34, § 29, and Halford, cited above, p. 1016, § 44).

                "57. There are a number of elements relevant to a consideration of whether a person’s private life is concerned by measures effected outside a person’s home or private premises. Since there are occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person’s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. A person who walks down the street will, inevitably, be visible to any member of the public who is also present. Monitoring by technological means of the same public scene (for example, a security guard viewing through closed-circuit television) is of a similar character. Private-life considerations may arise, however, once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence of such material from the public domain. It is for this reason that files gathered by security services on a particular individual fall within the scope of Article 8, even where the information has not been gathered by any intrusive or covert method (see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, §§ 43-44, ECHR 2000-V). The Court has referred in this context to the Council of Europe’s Convention of 28 January 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, which came into force on 1 October 1985 and whose purpose is “to secure in the territory of each Party for every individual ... respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data relating to him” (Article 1), such data being defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual” (Article 2) (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 65-67, ECHR 2000-II, where the storing of information about the applicant on a card in a file was found to be an interference with private life, even though it contained no sensitive information and had probably never been consulted)."

Where photographs were taken of an applicant at a public demonstration in a public place and retained by the police in a file, the Commission found no interference with private life, giving weight to the fact that the photograph was taken and retained as a record of the demonstration and no action had been taken to identify the persons photographed on that occasion by means of data processing (ibid., §§ 51-52)."

While it is generally the case that the recordings were made for the purpose of using the content of the conversations in some way, the Court is not persuaded that recordings taken for use as voice samples can be regarded as falling outside the scope of the protection afforded by Article 8. A permanent record has nonetheless been made of the person’s voice and it is subject to a process of analysis directly relevant to identifying that person in the context of other personal data. Though it is true that when being charged the applicants answered formal questions in a place where police officers were listening to them, the recording and analysis of their voices on this occasion must still be regarded as concerning the processing of personal data about the applicants."

The Court has found that the lack of any express basis in law for the interception of telephone calls on public and private telephone systems and for using covert surveillance devices on private premises does not conform with the requirement of lawfulness (see Malone, Halford and Khan, all cited above). It considers that no material difference arises where the recording device is operated, without the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned, on police premises.

                "65. The applicants complained that the non-disclosure of evidence in this case deprived them of a fair trial. It went beyond the mere withholding of documents from the defence since it also concerned the judge taking and recording evidence in the absence of the defence. This was not fair or capable of providing an adequate substitute for cross-examination. The witness in question was a key officer in the investigation and, since the defence did not hear the evidence, they could not put forward any meaningful arguments. While they did not dispute the accuracy of the description of the voir dire, it could not be suggested that defence counsel had “consented” to the manner in which the witness D.I. Mann was heard in private – he had a choice between the judge putting the questions and possibly deciding to reveal the answers, on the one hand, and the questions not being put at all, on the other. In any event, such a clandestine procedure cried out for review at the appeal stage, but since the defence did not know the content of the testimony there was no prospect of appeal on grounds of an error of law. Though they had not appealed on this point as the trial judge’s approach to the matter had complied with domestic law, there should, in their view, have been an automatic review by the Court of Appeal of the undisclosed material, otherwise errors of law or excesses of jurisdiction would go unchallenged."

The procedure adopted concerning the non-disclosure of part of D.I. Mann’s report complied with the requirements of Article 6 § 1, as the trial judge reviewed the material and was in the best position to balance the interests of the accused and the sensitivity of the material. The material was not disclosed to the jury and was extremely limited. It played no part in the conviction, being relevant only to ancillary questions of compliance with the Home Office Guidelines and having no bearing on guilt or innocence. They also pointed out that defence counsel agreed to the judge’s proposal that he question D.I. Mann with defence counsels’ questions in private and therefore that this part of the procedure took place with the consent of the defence. The need for non-disclosure was kept constantly under review by the judge, and the effectiveness of this safeguard was shown by his revisiting non-disclosure as the trial progressed and ordering disclosure of certain evidence."

It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, §§ 66-67). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires, as indeed does English law (see paragraph 30 above), that the prosecution authorities should disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247-B, p. 35, § 36)."

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, as a general principle, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 712, § 58). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Doorson, cited above, p. 471, § 72, and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, p. 712, § 54)."

Instead, the Court’s task is to ascertain whether the decision-making procedure applied in each case complied, as far as possible, with the requirements of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused (see Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28901/95, § 62, ECHR 2000-II)."

The questions which defence counsel had wished to put to the witness D.I. Mann were asked by the judge in chambers. The Court also notes that the material which was not disclosed in the present case formed no part of the prosecution case whatever, and was never put to the jury. The fact that the need for disclosure was at all times under assessment by the trial judge provided a further, important safeguard in that it was his duty to monitor throughout the trial the fairness or otherwise of the evidence being withheld. It has not been suggested that the judge was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1.

They pointed out that in Khan the Court referred to the fact that the evidence had been obtained in accordance with the Guidelines, whereas in their case there had been a clear breach of those Guidelines. It had not been shown that the police had made any significant efforts to obtain the evidence by other means (a precondition of permission to use such methods) and the Chief Constable had not given prior written confirmation of his authorisation, such only being effected retrospectively. While the applicant in Khan had obtained a review of his case on appeal, the applicants had been refused leave to appeal against the judge’s ruling. The Court in Khan had also given weight to the fact that the evidence obtained in breach of Article 8 had been strong and cogent. In their case, the evidence in relation to at least the first applicant was not particularly strong in that the forensic expert was only able to conclude that it was “likely” that his voice featured in the tape recordings. Finally, the applicants referred to the underhand manner in which police officers had obtained samples of their voices for comparison, in a procedure which was unregulated, arbitrary and attended by bad faith. It also violated their right not to incriminate themselves, as they had already expressly refused to give samples and these were in the event taken against their will."

The applicants had the opportunity, which they made use of, to challenge the admissibility of the recordings under section 78 of PACE. Their admissibility was judged by the most suitable tribunal, namely, the trial judge, by reference to the test of fairness. They were also able to appeal against the judge’s ruling to the Court of Appeal. The recordings had been obtained in accordance with the applicable code of practice. Furthermore, there was almost no dispute about the authenticity of the written transcript of the tapes, and the expert evidence on voice identification was corroborated by the visual observations of the surveillance team and by their video and photographic evidence. The applicants did not call any expert evidence to challenge the tapes. Accordingly, there was no reasonable doubt that it was their voices on the tapes, or about the reliability of the tapes as evidence. The content of the taped conversations was highly incriminating and those conversations had been entirely voluntary. The tapes were not in any event the only evidence against the applicants. The prosecution called forty-five witnesses, and incriminating evidence was found in B.’s flat and in the car which the applicants were driving."

The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, §§ 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1462, § 34). It is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, unlawfully obtained evidence – may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the alleged “unlawfulness” in question and, where violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found."

In Schenk, cited above, in concluding that the use of the unlawfully obtained recording in evidence did not deprive the applicant of a fair trial, the Court noted, first, that the rights of the defence had not been disregarded: the applicant had been given the opportunity, which he took, of challenging the authenticity of the recording and opposing its use, as well as the opportunity of examining Mr Pauty and summoning the police inspector responsible for instigating the recording. The Court further “ attache [d] weight to the fact that the recording of the telephone conversation was not the only evidence on which the conviction was based” (ibid., pp. 29-30, § 48). More recently, the Court has applied these principles in Khan (cited above, §§ 34-40) and found that the use at trial of recordings of the applicant’s conversations was not contrary to the requirements of Article 6 § 1 notwithstanding that they were obtained in circumstances where the Court had found, under Article 8 of the Convention, that the surveillance measures had not been “in accordance with the law”."

As in Khan, the fixing of the listening device and the recording of the applicants’ conversation were not unlawful in the sense of being contrary to domestic criminal law. Under English law there is in general nothing unlawful about a breach of privacy. There is no indication that the admissions made by the applicants during conversations in B.’s flat were made involuntarily, there being no entrapment and the applicants being under no inducement to make such admissions. Though the applicants asserted that in this case, unlike Khan, the police had not operated in conformity with the Home Office Guidelines, the Court notes that it is not argued that this rendered the police actions unlawful. While the Chief Constable gave written confirmation of authorisation retrospectively, there is no suggestion that he had not in fact been informed and given his oral permission. It is not established that any substantive precondition for the police exercising their surveillance powers was not in fact complied with. The “unlawfulness” in the present case therefore relates exclusively to the fact that there was no statutory authority for the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for private life and that, accordingly, such interference was not “in accordance with the law”, as that phrase has been interpreted in Article 8 § 2 of the Convention."

They did not challenge their authenticity, but challenged their use at the voir dire at which the trial judge assessed the effect of admitting the evidence on the fairness of the trial by reference to section 78 of PACE. Though the applicants were unsuccessful in their arguments and did not obtain leave to appeal, it is clear that, had the domestic courts been of the view that the admission of the evidence would have given rise to substantive unfairness, they would have had a discretion to exclude it. The applicants have argued that the evidence identifying in particular the first applicant’s voice on the tape was weak as it was only shown that it was “likely” to have been his voice. However, the Government have pointed out that there was other evidence corroborating the involvement of the applicants in the events. The Court considers that there was no unfairness in leaving it to the jury, on the basis of a thorough summing-up by the judge, to decide where the weight of the evidence lay."
