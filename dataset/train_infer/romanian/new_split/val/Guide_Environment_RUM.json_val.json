The Court considers that this obligation must be construed as applying in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake, and a fortiori in the case of industrial activities, which by their very nature are dangerous. In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § § 71 and 90)."

The relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89- 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 132 )."

As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’ s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 134-35)."

The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § § 136- 37).",

However, in the particular context of dangerous activities, the Court has considered that an official criminal investigation is indispensable given that public authorities are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused an incident. It has held that where the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity, the fact that those responsible for endangering life were not charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 93, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 140 )."

In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 94, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 142)."

It further appears that on 21 September 2001 the investigator in charge acknowledged the first applicant as a victim and civil claimant in the case, interviewed her and inspected the scene of the incident at her domicile (see paragraphs 46 - 47 above ). The sixth applicant was also granted victim status and informed thereof in a letter of 2 July 2002, that is almost eleven months after the proceedings were instituted.

The Court considers that rather than examining whether the preliminary investigation was fully compatible with all the procedural requirements established in such matters, it is essential to determine whether the competent authorities were determined to establish the circumstances of the events of 7 August 2001 and to identify and bring to justice those responsible ( see paragraph 191 above)."

With this in mind, the Court notes that originally criminal proceedings in connection with the flood of 7 August 2001 were brought against Mr L., the head of the Water Company, who ordered the evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir on the date in question. It appears that in the context of that investigation in case no. 916725, efforts were made to establish the circumstances of the incident of 7 August 2001. In particular, several expert examinations were carried out ( see paragraph 70 above). The resulting reports appear to have confirmed that the actions of the personnel of the Water Company, including Mr L., were correct in the circumstances ( see paragraphs 71 and 77 above), which prompted the investigating authorities to discontinue the criminal proceedings against Mr L. At the same time, as is clear from the decision of 25 January 2003, by which the criminal proceedings against Mr L. were terminated, the investigation established that the main reason for the flood of 7 August 2001 had been the poor state of the channel of the Pionerskaya river, and in particular the fact that it had been overgrown with trees and bushes and obstructed by various structures ( see paragraph 51 above ). As a result, separate criminal proceedings were ordered against officials from the Vladivostok municipal and Primorskiy regional authorities, presumably in that connection."

The Court notes that despite its request the Government did not submit a copy of the file of the investigation in case no. 292025, and therefore its ability to assess the effectiveness of that investigation is limited. The Court further has doubts that this latter investigation, as such, can be regarded as an adequate judicial response to the events of 7 August 2001, given that its main purpose appears to have been to establish whether there were any abuses in town planning policies in the Pionerskaya river valley, rather than to pursue any further the relevant findings previously made by the investigation in case no. 916725, and to identify those responsible for the poor maintenance of the Pionerskaya river channel, which, as established by the investigation in case no. 916725, had been the main reason for the flood of 7 August 2001."

The Court is struck by the fact that, having detected all those shortcomings, the investigating authorities decided to close the investigation, referring to the absence of evidence of a crime. It also notes that, while the decision of 20 July 2004 stated that the reason why the investigating authorities discontinued the proceedings against the officials of the Vladivostok Administration was that they had not exceeded their powers when allocating plots of land near the Pionerskaya river in the absence of any town planning restrictions at the time ( see paragraph 58 above), the reason why the proceedings against the authorities of the Primorskiy Region were also discontinued eludes the Court, as the aforementioned decision remained silent in that regard."

In the light of this finding and its general principles mentioned above ( see paragraph 190 above), the Court further does not consider that any other remedy, in particular the civil proceedings to which the relevant applicants had recourse to claim damages in connection with the flood of 7 August 2001, could have provided an adequate judicial response in respect of their complaint under Article 2 of the Convention."

However, the resulting document had not been duly registered with the competent State authority and had thus remained ineffective and could not be taken into account in elaborating town planning restrictions.

Not until 4 September 2000 had the Governor of the Primorskiy Region finally adopted a decree establishing a water protection zone that included the Pionerskaya river valley. The decree required the Vladivostok authorities to delimit water protection zones in the city ’ s general development plan, but the instruction was not followed as it would have meant updating that plan, which in turn would have meant conducting an ecological impact assessment of the plan.

In fact, such heavy rain had never been seen in the region before. Therefore, according to the Government, there was no way the authorities could have foreseen the drastic consequences of that rain. In particular, with reference to the relevant expert reports (see paragraphs 71 80 above), the Government argued that it had been impossible to avoid the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, and that the rate of the release of water from the reservoir on 7 August 2001 had been close to optimal. If the Pionerskoye reservoir had not existed, on the date in question the rain flooding to the mouth of the Pionerskaya river would have reached a maximum volume of 440 cubic metres per second. The Government also contended that prior to the heavy rain on 7 August 2001 the Pionerskoye reservoir had had sufficient water storage capacity to hold the rainwater if the amount that fell had corresponded to the amount forecast, and therefore before 7 August 2001 there had been no need to evacuate water in smaller quantities over a longer period in an attempt to avoid the flood. Indeed, as pointed out by the Government, the Pionerskoye reservoir, which supplied drinking water to the city of Vladivostok, was usually only refilled over a limited period during the rainy season."

Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 71, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 128).

Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, § § 49-55, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 146 ).

Article 2 of the Convention is therefore inapplicable.

Indeed, it is clear from the adduced materials that in the years preceding the flood, the authorities knew that it might be necessary urgently to release water from the reservoir. In particular, in his letter of 7 June 1999 the head of the Water Company informed the Vladivostok Administration that it might be necessary to evacuate water urgently from the reservoir in the event of heavy rain ( see paragraph 15 above ); and in a letter of 29 May 2000 the Vladivostok Administration admitted that the water level in the reservoir was close to critical and some of it would have to be evacuated ( see paragraph 19 above ). Against this background, even if it is prepared to accept that the rain on 7 August 2001 was of an exceptional intensity, the Court is not persuaded that the authorities could claim to have been taken unaware by the rain in so far as the operation of the Pionerskoye reservoir was concerned.

In particular, in a letter of 7 June 1999 addressed to the Vladivostok city authorities, the head of the Water Company stated that in view of the adverse weather forecast for the summer / autumn 1999, and in particular in the event of heavy rain, the Water Company might have to evacuate water from the reservoir, which might cause flooding over an extensive area given the poor state of the river channel (see paragraph 15 above)."

In particular, the said decision stated that the question of cleaning up the course of the Pionerskaya river was regularly raised every year, and yet no measures had been taken. The decision attested to the poor condition of the river channel, confirming, in particular, that the river channel as well as its outlet channels were abundantly overgrown with vegetation, cluttered with debris and household waste, and blocked by unauthorised dams and other structures which created a threat of flooding over an area of 15 square kilometres, with a population of over 5,000 people, in the event of the urgent large-scale release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision urged the authorities at the municipal and district levels to take the necessary measures, including cleaning and deepening the river channel to ensure that its throughput capacity was no less than 30-40 cubic metres per second. It was also prescribed that the local population be duly informed that the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river might be inundated in the event of the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision also ordered the restoration of the local early warning system to raise the alarm if there was a threat of flooding (see paragraph 16 above)."

Indeed, a letter from the Vladivostok Administration dated 29 May 2000 made it clear that the river channel remained overgrown with vegetation and cluttered with debris, that the risk of flooding persisted and that urgent steps should be taken in that connection ( see paragraph 19 above). A report by the Vladivostok Administration drawn-up on 4 July 2001, that is shortly before the events under examination, reflected in detail the poor state of the river channel and recommended a number of measures, similar to those already prescribed on several occasions (see paragraph 22 above)."

Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 152). In this connection, the Court notes that in a letter of 16 June 2000 the Administration of the Sovetskiy District of Vladivostok stated that the population living in the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river had been told what to do in the event of serious inundation ( see paragraph 20 above). However, the Court is sceptical about that statement, given that the letter provided no further details, for example, as to the form in which the information concerned had been provided to the population, or what the contents of that information were. At the same time, the Court notes that the applicants consistently maintained that, even though by 7 August 2001, when the flood occurred, they had been living near the Pionerskoye reservoir for many years, they had never been warned by the authorities that they lived in a flood -prone area ( see paragraphs 47 - 49 above)."

The applicants submitted that their homes and property had been severely damaged by the flood caused by the sudden large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. According to them, their lives had not yet returned to normal, and they had not received proper compensation for their damaged property. They considered the extra-judicial compensation that had been paid to them humiliating. Moreover, in view of the authorities ’ continued failure to take any measures to clean up and deepen the Pionerskaya river channel, there was no guarantee that the events of 7 August 2001 would not re-occur."

They argued that there was no evidence that the damage to the applicants ’ homes and possessions could have been avoided if the Pionerskaya river channel had been cleaned up or an emergency warning system at the Pionerskoye reservoir had been in place. They referred to court decisions taken in the applicants ’ civil cases at the domestic level, stating that the alleged losses had been suffered as a result of a natural disaster, in the form of exceptionally heavy rain. The Government also stated that the relevant domestic legislation imposed no obligation on the State to refund the market value of damaged property, and that given the large number of residents affected by the flood of 7 August 2001, the financial aid accorded by the State could scarcely have been more generous; however, the authorities had distributed what financial support they could to all those affected by the flood, directly, automatically and irrespective of whether they produced proof of any actual pecuniary damage."

The Court reiterates at the outset that whilst at times there may be a significant overlap between the concept of “home” under Article 8 of the Convention and that of “property” under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, a home may be found to exist even where the applicant has no right or interest in real property (see, mutatis mutandis, Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, §§ 35-39, 18 November 2004, and Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, § 128, 15 November 2007 ). Conversely, an individual may have a property right in a particular building or land, within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, without having sufficient ties with it for it to constitute a home under Article 8 (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI). In the present case, the applicants ’ complaints concerned damage done by the flood to their homes – of which the first, fourth and fifth applicants were owners and the second and sixth applicants were social tenants, and which the third applicant shared with the fourth applicant, her relative (see paragraphs 10 - 14 above) – and to their possessions in and around those homes. The Court considers it appropriate to examine the applicants ’ relevant complaints under both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The Court further observes that the applicants received certain extra-judicial compensation in respect of pecuniary losses they sustained as a result of the flood of 7 August 2001. In particular, the first applicant received a lump sum of RUB 14,000 ( approximately EUR 350 ) and the remaining applicants each received RUB 1,000 (approximately EUR 25) in financial support. The question therefore arises whether, for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention, the applicants can still claim to be “victims” of the alleged violation of their rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § § 178-93, ECHR 2006 ‑ V )."

Indeed, it is clear from the Government ’ s submissions on the issue that the compensation in question was accorded to all the victims of the flood of 7 August 2001 as financial aid and not in acknowledgment of the authorities ’ responsibility for the events in question. Moreover, no such acknowledgement was made in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the events of 7 August 2001, or in the civil proceedings which the applicants brought seeking compensation for their pecuniary losses. Also, even if the Court were prepared to regard the compensation in the amount of RUB 14,000 paid to the first applicant as an appropriate and sufficient redress, it clearly could not reach the same conclusion as regards the compensation in the amount of RUB 1,000 paid to the remaining applicants."

Italy ( dec .), no. 36811/97, 4 May 2000, and Öneryıldız, cited above, § 134 ). Allegations of a failure on the part of the State to take positive action in order to protect private property should be examined in the light of the general rule in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which lays down the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 98, ECHR 2000-I; Öneryıldız, cited above, § 133; and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 172 )."

Nor did they dispute the existence of the applicants ’ “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, or that the above homes and possessions were damaged as a result of the flood of 7 August 2001. The Court will therefore proceed to examine to what extent the authorities were under obligation to take measures to protect the applicants ’ homes and possessions, and whether this obligation was complied with in the present case."
            ],

                "215. The Court further notes that the Government seem to have argued, with reference to the findings of the domestic courts in the applicants ’ civil cases, that the alleged infringements of their rights under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were the result of a natural disaster, in the form of exceptionally heavy rain, which could not have been foreseen, and could therefore not be imputed to the State. The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, § 108, 21 February 2002 ). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162 - 165 above that the flooding of 7 August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities ’ manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities ’ failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk ( see paragraphs 168 - 180 and 185 above)."
            ],

The Court has no doubt that the causal link established between the negligence attributable to the State and the endangering of the lives of those living in the vicinity of the Pionerskoye reservoir also applies to the damage caused to the applicants ’ homes and property by the flood. Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to “interference” but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants ’ rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 136). Since it is clear that no such measures were taken, the Court concludes that the Russian authorities failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicants ’ homes and property."

The Court further considers it unnecessary to assess the relevance and reliability of the documentary evidence submitted by the fourth applicant to corroborate her claim for pecuniary damage, and to address the Government ’ s arguments in this respect ( see paragraph 254 above). It notes that an evaluation report drawn up by a competent State authority, as referred to by the Sovetskiy District Court of Vladivostok in its judgment of 25 February 2003, attested that the damage done to the possessions in the flat where the third and fourth applicants lived amounted to RUB 486,000 (approximately EUR 11,500 ). It further notes that the said court accepted that document as reliable proof of the actual damage sustained, and the Court has no reason to question that court ’ s reasoning (see paragraph 108 above). It therefore awards EUR 11,500 to the third and fourth applicants jointly in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

The Court agrees with the Government that it cannot take into account the certificate submitted by the fifth applicant to substantiate his claim for the inflation-adjusted amount of the pecuniary damage he sustained, as the document in question refers to the price index in a region other than the one where the fifth applicant lives. Accordingly, the Court awards the fifth applicant EUR 4,700 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

                "66. In today's society the protection of the environment is an increasingly important consideration (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), 18 February 1991, § 48, Series A no. 192, recently cited in Hamer v. Belgium, no. 21861/03, § 79, ECHR 2007 ‑ XIII (extracts); Turgut and Others v. Turkey, no. 1411/03, § 90, 8 July 2008; and Rimer and Others v. Turkey, no. 18257/04, § 38, 10 March 2009 ). However, Article 8 is not engaged every time environmental deterioration occurs: no right to nature preservation is included as such among the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols (see Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI; Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96 in limine, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). Indeed, that has been noted twice by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, which urged the Committee of Ministers to consider the possibility of supplementing the Convention in that respect (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). The State's obligations under Article 8 come into play in that context only if there is a direct and immediate link between the impugned situation and the applicant's home or private or family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Botta v. Italy, 24 February 1998, § 34 in limine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I ). Therefore, the first point for decision is whether the environmental pollution of which the applicant complains can be regarded as affecting adversely, to a sufficient extent, the enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life."
            ],
            [
                "75. The above ‑ mentioned cases make it plain that the question whether pollution can be regarded as affecting adversely an applicant's Article 8 rights depends on the particular circumstances and on the available evidence. In that connection, the Court would add that, in assessing evidence, it has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact, and it has been the Court's practice to allow flexibility in that respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 79). The salient question is whether the applicant has been able to show to the Court's satisfaction that there has been an actual interference with his private sphere, and, secondly, that a minimum level of severity has been attained (see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 70). The mere allegation that the reclamation scheme did not comply with domestic rules – such as the 1992 Regulations on hygienic requirements for the protection of health in the urban environment (see paragraph 51 above) – is not sufficient to ground the assertion that the applicant's rights under Article 8 have been interfered with (see, mutatis mutandis, Furlepa v. Poland (dec.), no. 62101/00, 18 March 2008, and Galev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 18324/04, 29 September 2009 )."

                "76. In the instant case, the Court, while not in doubt that the laying of sludge from the Plovdiv waste ‑ water treatment plant on the tailings pond created an unpleasant situation in the surroundings, is not persuaded that the resulting pollution affected the applicant's private sphere to the extent necessary to trigger the application of Article 8, for several reasons. First, unlike the situation in the majority of the above ‑ mentioned cases, the applicant's home and land are situated at a considerable distance from the pollution's source : his house is about one kilometre from the tailings pond and the land which he cultivates is about four kilometres away (see paragraph 7 above). Secondly – and this point is closely related to the first – the pollution emanating from the pond is not the result of active production processes which can lead to the sudden release of large amounts of toxic gases or substances (contrast López Ostra; Guerra and Others; and Fadeyeva, cited above). This also means that there is less risk of a sudden deterioration of the situation (contrast Tătar, cited above). Thirdly, there is no indication that there have been incidents entailing negative consequences for the health of those living in Elshitsa (contrast Guerra and Others and Tătar, both cited above). Admittedly, various domestic authorities found that the sludge laid on the pond, coming as it does partly from industrial waste water, contains substances – chiefly heavy metals – which are not suited for reclamation purposes and are capable of adversely affecting human health when spreading in the environment (see paragraphs 10, 11, 32, 34, 45 and 46 above). However, there are no materials in the case file to show that the pollution in and around the pond has caused an increase in the morbidity rate of Elshitsa's residents (contrast Fadeyeva, cited above) or has had a sufficiently adverse impact on the applicant's enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life. Indeed, the applicant conceded that he could not show any actual harm to his health or even a short ‑ term health risk, but merely feared negative consequences in the long term (see paragraph 62 above and contrast López Ostra and Fadeyeva, both cited above ). Nor did the applicant provide particulars showing that the degree of disturbance in and around his home had been such as to considerably affect the quality of his private or family life (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 118 )."

                "77. It is true that in declaring the applicant's application for judicial review admissible the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court found that the applicant, as well as all persons living near the pond, had a sufficient interest in bringing proceedings in relation to that situation (see paragraph 25 above). However, unlike the Turkish court in Taşkın and Others (cited above, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14), it did not base that ruling on findings about the extent to which the applicant had been personally affected by the impugned reclamation scheme. It rather had regard to the general aim of the domestic environmental protection legislation, which are quite different from the aims of Article 8 of the Convention. It should be pointed out in this connection that the conditions governing individual applications under the Convention are not necessarily the same as the national criteria relating to locus standi in domestic proceedings. National rules on that point may serve different purposes and, while those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be. Indeed, the underlying object of the Convention mechanism is to provide a safeguard to those personally affected by violations of fundamental human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ). As already noted, neither Article 8 nor any of other provision of the Convention or its Protocols were specifically designed to provide protection of the environment; other international instruments and domestic legislation are better suited to address such issues (see Kyrtatos, cited above, § 5 2 in fine )."

However, he has not apparently suffered any actual harm to date. In the absence of proof of any direct impact of the impugned pollution on the applicant or his family, the Court is not persuaded that Article 8 is applicable on that ground either (contrast McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom, 9 June 1998, §§ 96 and 97, Reports 1998 ‑ III, which concerned direct exposure to radiation from a nuclear explosion, and Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, §§ 155 and 156, ECHR 2005 ‑ X, which concerned direct exposure to mustard and nerve gas )."

It held a meeting on 7 September 1999 to discuss the relative merits of the two schemes. It noted that both lacked checks on the stability of the pond. However, according to an expert's report, neither of them would impair the pond's stability. Both lacked climatological and hydrological descriptions of the area and data on the expected consolidation of the sludge after the reclamation had ended. The problems relating to the neutralisation of the acid water were partially addressed in ET Marin Blagiev's scheme and not addressed in Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme. According to an expert's report, it was possible to use stabilised waste-water sludge from the Plovdiv treatment plant. The area around the pond did not have enough humus for the biological reclamation envisaged by Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme; it would thus be necessary to enrich the existing soil artificially. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme envisaged finishing the reclamation in eighteen months and resolving the dust-spread problem even before that. Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme also had an eighteen ‑ month timeline, but it was unrealistic. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme provided for the restoration of the productive qualities of 19.2 ha of polluted soil outside the tailings pond and its use for the production of specialised grass. According to accounts submitted by the two firms, ET Marin Blagiev's scheme would cost 5,139,356 Bulgarian levs (BGN) and Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme BGN 5,878,945. On that basis, the board recommended that the Ministry of Industry's Interdepartmental Expert Council approve ET Marin Blagiev's scheme. Two experts representing Panagyurski Mini EAD disagreed, saying that this scheme did not meet various regulatory requirements. In particular, waste ‑ water sludge was not appropriate for reclamation; humus was much better suited for that task. It was also unclear whether the use of sludge would yield stable and safe results. According to the relevant classifier, the sludge from the Plovdiv plant was hazardous waste, because it came not only from domestic but also from industrial waste water. The documents relating to the scheme did not specify the exact toxic-substance content of the sludge. Lastly, the scheme's scope and potential effects on the environment warranted an EIA.

He pointed out that he lived in Elshitsa, close to the place where the licence allowed sludge to be laid, and that the sludge could have adverse effects on the environment and human health. He also referred to Article 120 § 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 47 in fine below). He further argued that the decision was null and void, as its implementation was impossible. The decision allowed ET Marin Blagiev to carry and process domestic waste-water sludge. However, this could not be done, because the waste water treated in the Plovdiv plant came from both domestic and industrial sources. It was unfeasible to separate the domestic from the industrial sludge and for this reason it was impossible to carry and process solely domestic sludge. The applicant further argued that the Minister's decision unlawfully classified the sludge as industrial waste, as under the relevant rules it was hazardous waste; this was also evident from various analyses. Furthermore, the Minister had taken the decision in breach of the rules of procedure, as no EIA had been drawn up."

As the court did not rule on that request, on 21 February 2001 the applicant renewed it.

It said that there was a risk of heavy-metal contamination impacting on the population's health within a ten ‑ kilometre perimeter around the pond. The reclamation scheme lacked a suitable system for monitoring the underground water, where the migration of such metals could be expected, as the polymer cover was not stable in the long term. According to an expert in the Centre's toxicology laboratory, the heavy-metal content of the sludge spread on the pond was above the regulatory maximum, as shown by the chemical analysis of samples. The high levels of copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, cobalt and chrome led to a pollution risk and a risk to the population's health. So did the presence in the sludge of lead and manganese. Those metals could have a negative impact on the nerve, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the kidneys, the liver and the production of blood. Some of them were allergens, mutagens and carcinogens. The scheme's implementation would thus lead to a risk of dust from the sludge spreading in the atmosphere. There was also a risk that those metals would migrate through the surface and underground water, because of the acid pH of the water in the pond. The methodology for reclaiming old polluted areas classified the area situated ten to twenty kilometres from the source of the pollution as being at risk."

Firstly, Eco Elshitsa EOOD's report was actually indicative of pollution, as it had found that the heavy-metal content of the water flowing out of the pond was higher than the regulatory maximum. The report was in parts misleading because it used erroneous comparators, and covered only the time between November 2006 and November 2007. No information was available in respect of the preceding period and it was not envisaged to provide such information in the future. Moreover, the report did not contain any estimate of the scheme's effects on the health of the local population. In any event, it could not be seen as a reliable source of information as it had been drawn up by the very company which should have been monitored. The applicant secondly relied on the official reports mentioned in paragraph 46 above, which stated that the sludge from the Plovdiv plant contained heavy metals and constituted hazardous waste. Furthermore, an expert opinion obtained by the mayor of Elshitsa in 2004 had shown that the scheme had increased the pond's toxicity instead of providing a sustainable solution to the problem through its reclamation."

The applicant further pointed out that, as no studies had been carried out to assess the scheme's effects on the health of the local population, it was extremely hard to prove actual harm to his health. However, such harm was very likely, especially in the long term, in view of the air, plant and water pollution coming from the sludge and the consequent introduction of harmful substances in the food chain. In his view, the existence of such risk, which weighed heavily on his private and family life and the enjoyment of the amenities of his home, was sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8."

Second, since the laying of sludge in fact amounted to a waste ‑ disposal operation, it had been necessary to carry out an EIA under the law, both as it stood at the time of the implementation of the scheme and as amended after the 2002 changes. The discontinuance of the EIA procedure had therefore been unwarranted. Moreover, even if an EIA was not mandatory, it should have been carried out to dispel or confirm the local population's well ‑ founded fears. However, the authorities had chosen to ignore their continued protests, had not completed the EIA and had not made funding available for an assessment of the scheme's effect on the population's health."

They had opted for a controversial and polluting reclamation scheme over a benign one only because of the former's presumed lower cost, which had eventually turned out to be higher. When reaching their decision, they had not taken into account the opinion of the local authorities and had not notified those likely to be affected. Later they had ignored the applicant's requests to stay the scheme's implementation, and had not imposed on the contractor any obligations to minimise the impact of its activities on the environment."

In his further observations (see paragraph 6 above) the applicant submitted that under the applicable legislation and regulations, which he described in detail, reclamation schemes such as the one proposed and implemented by ET Marin Blagiev required a prior EIA. However, no such assessment had been carried out before the scheme's implementation and the one commissioned after that had remained unfinished. In the applicant's view, in approving that scheme and in granting ET Marin Blagiev a waste ‑ disposal licence, the authorities had acted in breach of domestic law. As a result of that, and of the authorities'passive attitude, there was no reliable information on the scheme's effects on the environment and the health of those living near the pond. Although the scheme's effects were not as tangible as noise or smell, they were nonetheless extremely harmful to the environment and to human health, as evidenced by the expert opinions of the National Centre for Hygiene, Medical Ecology and Nutrition. The toxic substances contained in the sludge, which exceeded many times the maximum regulatory levels and which migrated through the underground water, the atmosphere and the nutrition chain, had a direct effect on the applicant's home and his private and family life and attained the minimum level of severity required to bring Article 8 into play. It was also significant that the impugned situation had lasted more than ten years. It could not therefore be regarded as trivial or negligible. It was sufficiently serious to prompt the authorities to assess the pollution and find ways to tackle it. However, they had not taken effective steps in that regard, and had not followed appropriate procedures allowing the applicant's views to be heard."

However, Article 8 is not engaged every time environmental deterioration occurs: no right to nature preservation is included as such among the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols (see Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI; Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96 in limine, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). Indeed, that has been noted twice by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, which urged the Committee of Ministers to consider the possibility of supplementing the Convention in that respect (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). The State's obligations under Article 8 come into play in that context only if there is a direct and immediate link between the impugned situation and the applicant's home or private or family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Botta v. Italy, 24 February 1998, § 34 in limine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I ).

The issue first came up in a case concerning a plant for the treatment of liquid and solid waste situated twelve metres from the applicant's home. Based on medical reports and expert opinions showing that hydrogen sulphide emissions from the plant exceeded the permitted limit and could endanger the health of those living nearby, and that there could be a causal link between those emissions and health problems suffered by the applicant's daughter, and the acceptance of the domestic courts that, without being a grave health risk, the nuisances in issue impaired the quality of life of those living in the plant's vicinity, the Court was satisfied that Article 8 was engaged (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § § 7, 49 and 50, Series A no. 303 ‑ C ). In that case the Court famously said that “ severe environmental pollution may affect individuals'well ‑ being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health ” (ibid., § 51 in limine )."

The Court noted that the crucial element which must be present in determining whether, in a given case, environmental pollution has adversely affected one of the rights safeguarded by that provision was the existence of a harmful effect on a person's private or family sphere and not simply the general deterioration of the environment (see Kyrtatos, cited above, § § 52 and 53 )."

To reach that conclusion, it had regard to the findings of the domestic courts, based on an environmental impact assessment, that the operation of the mine had caused widespread environmental degradation and had affected the applicants ( see Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14, ECHR 2004 ‑ X ). It reiterated those findings in a follow ‑ up case concerning the same mine (see Öçkan and Others v.

It held that to raise an issue under Article 8, environmental pollution must directly affect the applicant's home, family or private life and that its adverse effects must attain a certain minimum level. It went on to say that the assessment of that minimum was relative and depended on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or mental effects. The general context of the environment should also be taken into account, there being no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in a modern city (see Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 68 ‑ 70, with further references ). In finding Article 8 applicable, the Court took into consideration that the concentration of polluting substances in the air near the applicant's home had continuously exceeded the applicable norms, that the State had recognised that the environmental situation had caused an increase in the morbidity rate for the local residents, that the domestic courts had recognised the applicant's right to be resettled away from the “sanitary security zone” in which she lived, and that there was a “very strong combination of indirect evidence and presumptions ” which made it possible to conclude that the applicant's prolonged exposure to emissions from the plant had caused her health to deteriorate or had at least made her more vulnerable to various illnesses and had adversely affected her quality of life at home (ibid., §§ 80 ‑ 88). The Court made similar findings in a later case concerning the same iron smelter (see Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 53247/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, §§ 96 ‑ 100, 26 October 2006 )."

The above ‑ mentioned cases make it plain that the question whether pollution can be regarded as affecting adversely an applicant's Article 8 rights depends on the particular circumstances and on the available evidence. In that connection, the Court would add that, in assessing evidence, it has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact, and it has been the Court's practice to allow flexibility in that respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 79). The salient question is whether the applicant has been able to show to the Court's satisfaction that there has been an actual interference with his private sphere, and, secondly, that a minimum level of severity has been attained (see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 70). The mere allegation that the reclamation scheme did not comply with domestic rules – such as the 1992 Regulations on hygienic requirements for the protection of health in the urban environment (see paragraph 51 above) – is not sufficient to ground the assertion that the applicant's rights under Article 8 have been interfered with (see, mutatis mutandis, Furlepa v.

In the instant case, the Court, while not in doubt that the laying of sludge from the Plovdiv waste ‑ water treatment plant on the tailings pond created an unpleasant situation in the surroundings, is not persuaded that the resulting pollution affected the applicant's private sphere to the extent necessary to trigger the application of Article 8, for several reasons. First, unlike the situation in the majority of the above ‑ mentioned cases, the applicant's home and land are situated at a considerable distance from the pollution's source : his house is about one kilometre from the tailings pond and the land which he cultivates is about four kilometres away (see paragraph 7 above). Secondly – and this point is closely related to the first – the pollution emanating from the pond is not the result of active production processes which can lead to the sudden release of large amounts of toxic gases or substances (contrast López Ostra; Guerra and Others; and Fadeyeva, cited above). This also means that there is less risk of a sudden deterioration of the situation (contrast Tătar, cited above). Thirdly, there is no indication that there have been incidents entailing negative consequences for the health of those living in Elshitsa (contrast Guerra and Others and Tătar, both cited above). Admittedly, various domestic authorities found that the sludge laid on the pond, coming as it does partly from industrial waste water, contains substances – chiefly heavy metals – which are not suited for reclamation purposes and are capable of adversely affecting human health when spreading in the environment (see paragraphs 10, 11, 32, 34, 45 and 46 above). However, there are no materials in the case file to show that the pollution in and around the pond has caused an increase in the morbidity rate of Elshitsa's residents (contrast Fadeyeva, cited above) or has had a sufficiently adverse impact on the applicant's enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life. Indeed, the applicant conceded that he could not show any actual harm to his health or even a short ‑ term health risk, but merely feared negative consequences in the long term (see paragraph 62 above and contrast López Ostra and Fadeyeva, both cited above ). Nor did the applicant provide particulars showing that the degree of disturbance in and around his home had been such as to considerably affect the quality of his private or family life (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 118 )."

However, unlike the Turkish court in Taşkın and Others (cited above, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14), it did not base that ruling on findings about the extent to which the applicant had been personally affected by the impugned reclamation scheme. It rather had regard to the general aim of the domestic environmental protection legislation, which are quite different from the aims of Article 8 of the Convention. It should be pointed out in this connection that the conditions governing individual applications under the Convention are not necessarily the same as the national criteria relating to locus standi in domestic proceedings. National rules on that point may serve different purposes and, while those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be. Indeed, the underlying object of the Convention mechanism is to provide a safeguard to those personally affected by violations of fundamental human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ).

Switzerland, 26 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997 ‑ IV ). Later, in Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland ( [GC], no. 27644/95, §§ 4 6 ‑ 55, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ), the Court fully confirmed that position. Much like the applicants in those two cases, in his application to the Supreme Administrative Court the applicant in the instant case did not point to concrete health hazards, but complained about the reclamation scheme's hypothetical consequences for the environment and human health (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). It must therefore be concluded that the connection between the proceedings – whose sole object was the lawfulness of the decision to grant a licence allowing ET Marin Blagiev to carry and lay sludge – and the right invoked by the applicant was too tenuous."

            [
                "93. It is true that in an earlier case, Zander, where the applicants had sought to challenge a licence allowing a company to lay waste in a dump adjacent to their property, the Court found Article 6 § 1 applicable, saying that the outcome of the proceedings was decisive for the applicants'entitlement to protection against pollution (see Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, §§ 2 4 and 25, Series A no. 279 ‑ B ). However, that conclusion was clearly influenced by the fact that the dump was indisputably polluting the water in the applicants'well, which was their only source of drinking water. The adverse effects on their health were thus, unlike the situation in the present case, immediate and certain. Similarly, in Taşkın and Others the Court found that the applicants'right to protection of their physical integrity was directly at stake in the proceedings before the Turkish Supreme Administrative Court, because the scale of the risk had been established by that court (see Taşkın and Others, cited above, § 133, as well as Öçkan and Others, cited above, § 52 ). In Okyay and Others, the Court made similar findings, and regarded the fact that the domestic courts had ruled in the applicants'favour on the merits as decisive (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey, no. 36220/97, §§ 65 ‑ 6 8, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII ). The position in the present case, in which the Supreme Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings and did not make any findings about the reclamation scheme's effect on the applicant's health or well ‑ being (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above), is different."

            [
                "94. Lastly, the Court cannot subscribe to the applicant's argument that Article 6 § 1 applied to the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court because, if that court had decided to annul the licence, the applicant would have been able to apply, in separate proceedings, for compensation under section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 54 above). There is no question that if the applicant had brought such compensation proceedings Article 6 § 1 would have applied to them (see, among other authorities, Editions Périscope v. France, 26 March 1992, § § 37 and 40, Series A no. 234 ‑ B ). However, that does not mean that it is applicable, on that ground alone, to earlier proceedings whose outcome is capable of supplying the cause of action for such compensation proceedings. Proceedings do not become “civil” merely because they have economic implications, and the application for judicial review lodged by the applicant pursued the sole aim of having the licence annulled (see, mutatis mutandis, SARL du Parc d'activités de Blotzheim and SCI Haselaecker v. France (dec.), no. 48897/99, ECHR 2003 ‑ III )."

In sum, the Court finds that the outcome of the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court was decisive for the question whether the licence granted to ET Marin Blagiev was valid, but not for the “determination” of any “civil right” which Bulgarian law conferred on the applicant as a private individual."

However, the Court considers that in the present case, a great deal of information was voluntarily provided to the public by MHPA and the developers of the projects. The applicants have failed to demonstrate that any substantive documents were not disclosed to them. In any event, in respect of any information which they allege was not provided, they had access to a mechanism established by law to allow them specifically to seek particular information, a mechanism which they employed successfully.

Again, we are researching this, testing on the simulators and undertaking risk assessments, but it is likely that we will be looking to undertake some dredging to widen the shipping channel to the South so that some vessels, including the ferry, will be able to pass the South Hook Jetty with an LNG ship alongside at a further distance than would be the case otherwise. We are also looking at other ways of controlling shipping passing the South Hook Jetty in such circumstances which could include criteria of speed, tugs in attendance, maybe even a ‘ guard ’ tug in the vicinity of the LNG ship and restricting any movements to one vessel at a time, certain weather conditions etc”"

We do not have the ability to deny access to any ship (other than in very specific and individual circumstances) given that the UK operates what can be loosely termed an ‘ open ports policy ’. What we do have is a responsibility to ensure that any shipping movements are managed in a safe and efficient manner. To this end we have undertaken, and continue to undertake, a wide range of risk assessments to determine the way in which this safe and effective management will be carried out. There is therefore no one single document or set of documents that clearly define the situation in which a ‘ go/no-go decision ’ can be determined, but rather a continuing process of scenario setting, risk assessment, trial, refining scenarios and identification of mitigation and prevention measures in which a wide number of variables are taken into account – some of which are still being developed as decisions as to the type of ships and their characteristics are being defined by the terminal operators and their teams.”"

He noted that, in so far as the applicants complained of the absence of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment or its failure to take account of marine risks, the complaints were directed towards the grant of planning permission itself, rather than hazardous substances consent. In relation to both sites, relevant planning permissions had been granted more than three months before the judicial review proceedings were brought.

One has to bear in mind in this connection the very extensive assessments carried out by the Health and Safety Executive, because these provide the context for the Port Authority ’ s assessment. The Health and Safety Executive did assessments which considered both the consequences and the likelihood of an escape of LNG for all land ‑ based and jetty-based activities. Those included the risk of catastrophic failure of an LNG storage tank at the terminal; the failure of a loading arm at the jetty while LNG was being transferred from ship to shore; and ‘ major release from a delivery ship while tied up at a jetty ’ : see HSE responses to Park Authority, 5 March 2004, and the HSE Summary Grounds of Resistance, paragraphs 10 and 11. Having carried out these assessments, the Health and Safety Executive did not object to the proposal for either terminal on safety grounds. The applicants do not criticise the work done by the Health and Safety Executive.",

But the Port Authority, which is responsible for advising on such accidents, did participate in an assessment process which led to a risk assessment submitted by the South Hook LNG Terminal Company Limited in December 2002 ‘ to identify hazards, consequences and possible mitigation measures ’ relating to the use of the port as proposed: see the Port Authority ’ s Summary Grounds of Resistance, paragraph 28(b) ( emphasis added). It refers in those grounds to a number of other reports and exercises carried out, so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety. In any event, once the Health and Safety Executive had concluded that there were no unacceptable risks to the local population arising from either a catastrophic storage tank failure on land or a major release of LNG from a tanker tied up at a jetty, the crucial element in any assessment of risk from a vessel not moored to the jetty must have been the risk of a collision. The risks to the population from a vapour cloud travelling over land or sea had already been considered by the Health and Safety Executive, since the jetties end far out in the Haven. What the Port Authority needed to concentrate on above all else was the risk of a collision, and that it seems to have done.”"

Until that date, there was an issue of fact: whether or not the HSE had carried out the tests and risk assessments which they said they had carried out. That issue of fact arose because the applicants asserted that those risk assessments had not been carried out. The HSE, in a summary of grounds – the truth of which was verified by its solicitor – asserted that they had been. That question of fact had been determined against the applicants in the judgments which this court handed down on 17 March ... It is clear that it was determined against the applicants in reliance on what was said by the HSE in the summary grounds of objection.",

In those circumstances, it would have been inappropriate for the court to reopen that question of fact in the period between making its judgments available in draft and the formal handing down of those judgments. The purpose of making the judgments available in draft is not to invite further submissions on questions of fact which have already been decided, but to enable the parties to draw attention to obvious errors of fact, such as a mis-name or a mis-date. Nor would it have been a proper ground for reopening the application for permission to appeal that the claimants, through their solicitors, continued to assert that the court had reached the wrong conclusion of fact on the evidence. But a significant change occurred when it became clear that the court had reached the conclusion of fact which it did as a result of being misled by the HSE though the statement of objections.”"

That context is that both the HSE and the Port Authority had undoubtedly carried out a number of exercises and studies before advising the planning authorities that there was no objection on safety grounds. The HSE for its part had assessed the consequences of an escape of LNG from a land-based storage tank; from the failure of a loading arm at the jetty; and from the guillotine rupture of a thirty inch pipeline between the jetty and the storage tanks ... Those assessments have not been criticised. It is to be observed that the HSE assessments of the failure of a storage tank on land included that of a catastrophic failure, which would take place at a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population than the proposed jetties. Yet the HSE was satisfied that public safety would not be jeopardised, presumably because of the very low likelihood of such an incident.",

Those were, as one might expect, largely directed towards an assessment of marine risks. They included a report from a Senior Risk Analyst at Lloyd ’ s Register of Shipping, commissioned to assess the risk of explosion and gas release from LNG carriers ... There was also evidence before the judge and before this court that there had never been an incident of major release of LNG from a ship to the external atmosphere ...",

The Port Authority has statutory responsibilities for safety within the Haven and it advised the decision-makers, the County Council and the Park Authority, that there was no such risk to public safety as to warrant refusal of the applications. It was principally for the Port Authority to decide on what research was necessary for it to be so satisfied. It is not for this court or any court to try to second guess the Authority ’ s decision on what it needs by way of research in order to advise the decision-makers, unless it is obvious that it has neglected its statutory duties. The evidence falls far short of that. In short, the factual point now seen to be mistaken was of limited significance even on this aspect of the case. Moreover, as Mr Straker on behalf of the Port Authority submits, that Authority has powers, if at any time it should appear to it that the risks are likely to be greater than presently seem to be the case, to prevent the jetties being used for LNG unloading, and of course the planning authorities also have powers to revoke the consents with which these proceedings are concerned.”"

In the applicants ’ case, no severe environmental pollution had actually occurred, nor was there any likelihood of exposure to such pollution through the operation of the terminals. Their allegations were confined to the potential marine risks posed by the operation of the LNG terminals. In such a case, in order to show that Article 8 was applicable, the Government contended that the applicants had to be able to assert arguably, and in a detailed manner, that for lack of adequate precautions taken by the authorities, the degree of probability of the occurrence of damage was such that it could be considered to constitute a violation (citing Asselbourg v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 29121/95, 29 June 1999).

The present case, by contrast, concerned a continuing threat, and there was copious evidence that fears as to the consequences of an LNG spill were real. In particular, industry reports demonstrated that there was a risk arising from LNG operations.

In particular, there is no allegation of any continuing pollution caused by the transport of LNG in Milford Haven. The risk, according to the applicants, arises from the possibility of a collision in the haven, leading to the escape of a large quantity of LNG and the potential for an explosion or a fire as a result of such an accident.

The projects were of such a nature as to require, pursuant to the EIA Directive, that environmental impact assessments be prepared (see paragraphs 130 - 131 above). The installations were classified as “top tier” for the purposes of the COMAH Regulations, entailing more onerous conditions on the operators (see paragraph 46 above). The SIGTTO guidance to which the applicants referred makes recommendations regarding the manner of selection of a site for an LNG terminal in order to minimise marine risks. It also makes reference to the risk of fire and explosion in the event of an escape of LNG into the atmosphere (see paragraphs 161 - 170 above). A report by the HSE, following an initial examination of the consequences of a major release from a delivery ship moored at the jetty, concluded that released LNG plumes would be capable of engulfing Milford Haven (see paragraph 33 above), the town where both applicants reside."

The applicants ’ complaint concerned the assessment of the marine risks, in particular, the danger of a major release of LNG from a delivery ship. They argued that it was not obvious which body was responsible for assessing such risks in the context of advising the planning and hazardous substances authorities. Unlike the HSE, MHPA had commercial interests in the operation of the haven, and it was not clear if it was even a statutory consultee in relation to the applications for planning permission and hazardous substances consent. The applicants contrasted the risk assessment of the land-based risks by the HSE and the EA, under the Hazardous Substances Regulations and the COMAH Regulations, with the position regarding marine-based risks, where there was no equivalent assessment by an independent regulator and the COMAH Regulations did not apply. In the applicants ’ view, it could not be assumed that because a gas leak on the shore had been assessed as “acceptable”, a similar risk at sea was also acceptable, referring to the conclusions of their expert, Dr Cox (see paragraphs 127 - 128 above)."

A process of assessment by relevant bodies and examination of the application by the planning authorities followed. A separate application was required in respect of hazardous substances consent (see paragraphs 10 - 11 and 138 - 139 above), with a similarly detailed examination by the relevant authority and an assessment by statutory consultees, which included the HSE and MHPA. The COMAH Regulations imposed further stringent requirements on the operators of the Dragon and South Hook sites to take all measures necessary to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences (see paragraphs 144 - 148 and 152 above). MHPA itself has powers to regulate the use of the port and to issue instructions and directions to users to ensure safety within the haven (see paragraphs 154 - 155 above). It has voluntarily complied with the Code, which provides further guidance to improve safety with port areas (see paragraphs 157 - 158 above). Vessels entering the haven are subject to a regime of certification to ensure that they are capable of carrying dangerous liquids (see paragraph 156 above). Industry reports prepared by SIGTTO provide additional guidelines on selecting sites for LNG terminals and promoting best practice in the field (see paragraphs 161 - 170 above).

Although he mistakenly believed at that time that this included a major release from a delivery ship while tied up at the jetty, he later explained that this error did not affect his conclusions that the risk assessments had been adequate. He noted that the HSE had carried out an assessment of the possibility of an LNG release on the shore, a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population then the proposed jetties (see paragraph 101 above). The judge also referred to the assessment process in which MHPA had participated and to the various reports and exercises carried out so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety, cited in its summary grounds. He noted that MHPA had been required to concentrate on the risk of a collision, and that it appeared to have done this. Taking into account the studies undertaken by the HSE, together with the assessments and exercises conducted by MHPA, the judge was satisfied that the relevant matters had been considered by the authorities (see paragraph 93 above)."

In the court ’ s subsequent decision on the re - opening application, the judge referred again to the range of studies carried out by MHPA, which he observed were largely directed towards an assessment of the marine risks. He noted that there was evidence before the court that there had never been an incident involving a major release from a ship to the external atmosphere. He emphasised that it was principally for MHPA to decide what research was necessary for it to be satisfied as to the level of risk to public safety from the operation of the LNG terminals, and considered that the evidence fell “far short” of demonstrating that MHPA had neglected its statutory duties. Finally, he made reference to the power of the authorities to revoke the consents if evidence emerged that the risks posed by the unloading of LNG at the jetties were greater than they then appeared (see paragraph 101 above)."

Turning to the assessments conducted by the relevant authorities, the Court observes that both sites were the subject of lengthy Environmental Statements, which identified potential risks from the operation of the LNG terminals and proposed mitigating measures (see paragraphs 17 - 25, 30 - 32 and 44 - 48 above). In respect of the Dragon terminal, the Statement referred to MHPA ’ s role in assisting Petroplus in planning the marine aspects of the project to ensure the safety of the proposal. It made reference to exercises to be conducted and to the need for consultation in respect of an assessment of the marine risks and during the design, construction and operational stages of the project (see paragraph 21 above). A real-time simulation exercise was carried out, and conclusions regarding wind conditions were drawn from it (see paragraph 22 above). Consideration was given to the effects of the increase in traffic within the haven (see paragraphs 23 and 31 above). Mitigation measures identified included continuing consultation and further simulation exercises (see paragraph 23 above). In the context of the assessment for the South Hook site, reference was made to a formal marine hazard exercise which identified potential mitigation measures which could be incorporated into the design of the terminal (see paragraph 47 above). Specific hazards with the potential to extend beyond the boundaries of the site itself were also identified and safeguards were proposed (see paragraph 48 above). In its submissions to the planning authorities and through correspondence and interviews in the media, MHPA explained that it was working with specialists to ensure the safe and effective management of large LNG vessels in the haven ( see paragraphs 26 - 27, 40, 49, 55 - 56, 64 - 66 and 68 - 70 above). In particular the Chief Executive of MHPA identified possible measures which could reduce risks and explained that MHPA had been working with the developers to ensure that the possibility of a shipping incident was extremely low (see paragraphs 55 - 56 above). He emphasised that MHPA had the power to control the passage of LNG vessels through the haven by laying down conditions regarding, for example, the time of entry, state of the tide, the number of pilots and the number of tugs (see paragraph 64 above). He and the Harbourmaster of the haven consistently referred to the risk assessment work undertaken by the developers, MHPA and other specialists (see paragraphs 55 - 56, 65 - 66 and 68 - 69 above). In its summary grounds in the later judicial review proceedings, reference was made to a number of different reports and studies which had informed MHPA ’ s view on the safety of the proposals and its strategy for managing the LNG vessels in the haven (see paragraphs 71 - 72 above)."

The Court notes that the applicants have provided a copy of a report and a letter from an expert originally instructed in 2008 in the context of a complaint made to the European Commission (see paragraphs 125 - 128 above). The expert expressed the view that there were a number of gaps in the risk assessment carried out, and that the information collated had never been pulled together in a clear and convincing analysis (see paragraphs 127 ‑ 128 above). However, it is clear that the report was prepared after the domestic proceedings had terminated, and the applicants appear to have lodged no expert report for consideration by the domestic courts in the context of their judicial review claim. If they consider that new expert evidence provides support for their claims regarding the assessment of the marine risks, then it is open to them, as the Court of Appeal itself pointed out (see paragraph 101 above), to apply to have the consents revoked. In such proceedings they could rely on any new expert evidence. In any event, the evidence merely expressed one view on a situation which was capable of multiple differing opinions, and as noted above, the courts were satisfied that on the basis of all the evidence before them, the assessments carried out were adequate."

                "77. As the Court has noted in a number of its judgments, Article 8 has been relied on in various cases in which environmental concerns are raised (see, among many other authorities, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). However, in order to raise an issue under Article 8 the interference about which the applicant complains must directly affect his home, family or private life and must attain a certain minimum level if the complaints are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C; and Fadeyeva, cited above, § 69-70). Therefore, the first point for decision is whether the environmental pollution of which the applicant complains can be regarded as affecting adversely, to a sufficient extent, the enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life (see Ivan Atanasov v. Bulgaria, no. 12853/03, § 66, 2 December 2010 ). In this respect, the Court recalls that water pollution was one of the factors which was found to affect the applicants ’ health and hence their ability to enjoy their home, private and family life in the case of Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine (no. 30499/03, §§ 110 and 113, 10 February 2011)."

The assessment of the minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as, the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects. The general context of the environment should also be taken into account. The Court recently recalled that there could be no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible when compared to the environmental hazards inherent in life in every modern city (see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, no. 31965/07, § 188, 14 February 2012 )."

As regards health impairment, it is hard to distinguish the effect of environmental hazards from the effects of other relevant factors, such as, age, profession or personal lifestyle. Also, as regards the general context of the environment, there is no doubt that severe water and soil pollution may negatively affect public health in general and worsen the quality of an individual ’ s life, but it may be impossible to quantify its actual effects in each individual case, “ quality of life” itself being a subjective characteristic which does not lend itself to a precise definition (see, mutatis mutandis, Ledyayeva and Others v.

Taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court will primarily give regard to the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing the factual circumstances of the case. As a basis for the analysis it may use, for instance, domestic legal provisions determining unsafe levels of pollution and environmental studies commissioned by the authorities. Special attention will be paid by the Court to individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to an applicant ’ s particular situation, such as an undertaking to revoke a polluter ’ s operating licence or to resettle a resident away from a polluted area. However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially when they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such a situation it has to assess the evidence in its entirety. Further sources of evidence for consideration in addition to the applicant ’ s personal accounts of events, will include, for instance, his medical certificates as well as relevant reports, statements or studies made by private entities (see Dubetska and Others v.

In that case, the Court recognised that the potential risks to the environment caused by the construction and operation of two liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminals established a sufficiently close link with the applicant ’ s private live and home for the purposes of Article 8 and thereby triggered the application of that provision ( see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, § 192, cited above)."

The Court notes that the domestic environmental health and sanitary regulations clearly prohibited placing the cemetery in close proximity to residential buildings and water sources (see paragraphs 6 7 to 72 above). It appears that the nearest boundary of the cemetery is situated 38 metres away from the applicant ’ s house (see paragraph 3 3 above). This cannot be regarded as a minor irregularity but as a rather serious breach of domestic regulations given that the actual distance is just over one tenth of the minimum distance permissible by those rules. Furthermore, the cemetery is a continuous source of possible health hazards and the potential damage caused by such is not easily reversible or preventable. Such environmental dangers have been acknowledged by the authorities on numerous occasions, including, by prohibiting the use of the illegal cemetery for burials and by the offer to resettle the applicant (see paragraphs 20 – 25 and 49 above). It further notes that the domestic authorities established that the construction of a cemetery at the said location placed the applicant at risk of contamination of the soil and of the drinking and irrigation water sources because of emanations from decomposing bodies like ptomaine (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has particular regard to the fact that there was no centralised water supply in the Tatariv village and villagers used their own wells (see paragraph 9 above). It also appears that the high level of E. coli found in the drinking water of the applicant ’ s well was far in excess of permitted levels and may have emanated from the cemetery (see paragraphs 1 2, 1 8 and 3 0 above), although the technical reports came to no definitive or unanimous conclusion as to the true source of E. coli contamination (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, the high level of E. coli, regardless of its origin, coupled with clear and blatant violation of environmental health safety regulations confirmed the existence of environmental risks, in particular, of serious water pollution, to which the applicant was exposed."

Under such circumstances, the Court concludes that the construction and use of the cemetery so close to the applicant ’ s house with the consequent impact on the environment and the applicant ’ s “quality of life ” reached the minimum level required by Article 8 and constituted an interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home and private and family life.

They further stated that while it was true that the cemetery had been built in breach of environmental health laws and regulations as it had lacked the health protection zone required by law, the authorities had done all they could to prohibit burials and to provide the applicant with an opportunity to be re- housed, even though such an obligation to resettle had not existed in law. According to them, he had continuously rejected such proposals. In this respect they supplied letters of 10, 15 and 16 December 2009 from Tarariv Council and the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional State Administration, in which the municipal authorities stated that the applicant was not interested in resettlement (see paragraph 3 4 above).

However, they concern allegations of health hazards arising from the local authority ’ s decision to locate a cemetery just 38 meters from the applicant ’ s home in breach of domestic regulations plus the State ’ s failure to act in securing compliance with the domestic environmental standards. The allegations also concern the State ’ s failure to regulate the activities of the municipality in line with such standards. The Court ’ s task in such a situation is to assess whether the State took all reasonable measures to secure the protection of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In making such an assessment factors, including compliance with the domestic environmental regulations and judicial decisions, must be analysed in the context of a given case (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubetska and Others v.

Furthermore, the procedural safeguards available to the applicant under Article 8 may be rendered inoperative and the State may be found liable under the Convention where a judicial decision, prescribing certain conduct to the authorities on environmental issues, is ignored by the authorities or remains unenforced for an important period of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Taşkın and Others v.

There was no lawfully approved construction plan, in contravention of the Laws of Ukraine “On Burials and Burial Service” (see paragraph 6 8 above) and “On Drinking Water and the Drinking Water Supply ”. In particular, the latter Act in its Sections 27 – 30 established obligatory sanitary and hygiene standards of drinking water and water supply, envisaging no E. coli content in drinking water (see paragraph 72 above);",

The eviction procedure under section 45 of the 1951 Property Act was only applicable to a flat ’ s owner, whereas in the present case the nuisances had been created by tenants. In any event, that procedure was quite burdensome when compared with the quick and effective remedies that they had used. A claim under section 109(1) of the Act would not have been effective either. Firstly, that provision was very general. Secondly, as was evident from the domestic courts ’ case ‑ law, any claim under it would have been premised on showing that the activities in a neighbouring flat were unlawful, which could be determined only in separate proceedings concerned with the legality of the works in the flat. The domestic case ‑ law also showed that that such a claim could be successful only if it touched upon the technical aspects of a reconstruction in a neighbouring property. Moreover, such a claim protected directly the integrity of a property, not the private lives or homes of those living in it. By contrast, section 38 of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act and of regulation 10(3) of the Regulations on the Manner of Carrying On Commercial Activities on the Territory of the Municipality of Sofia were intended to safeguard precisely the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention.

Slovakia (dec.), no. 18968/07, 16 June 2009 ).

As to the other civil ‑ law remedy suggested by the Government, a claim under section 109(1) of the 1951 Property Act, the Court notes that the prevailing case ‑ law of the national courts under that provision shows that in such proceedings they distinguish between nuisances resulting from the mere reconstruction of a neighbouring building and those stemming from activities there, regard noise as an actionable nuisance in itself, and are likelier to focus their attention not so much on the objective legality of a reconstruction but on its impact on the neighbours. If the courts allow a claim under section 109(1), they can enjoin the perpetrator of the nuisance to remove the reconstruction and/or stop or abate any activities which unduly interfere with the owner ’ s rights (see paragraphs 57 ‑ 62 above). It thus seems, contrary to what the applicants suggest, that such a claim would not have been necessarily premised upon the setting ‑ aside, in previous proceedings, of any building permits issued to the applicants ’ neighbours, and would have been capable of addressing the gist of the applicants ’ grievance and providing them with effective redress."

In its recent decision in Galev and Others the Court noted that in Bulgaria administrative proceedings concerning the lawfulness of a flat ’ s reconstruction centred on the legality of the changes to the building and – unlike a claim under section 109(1) – did not involve direct consideration of the question whether nuisances coming from such flat would unduly interfere with the neighbours ’ rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Galev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 18324/04, 29 September 2009 ). However, in the instant case the applicants managed to obtain from the building control authorities a decision prohibiting the use of the computer club (see paragraph 25 above). If enforced, that decision would have had the same effect as a court order or injunction made in proceedings under section 1 09 (1), namely abatement of the nuisance (see, mutatis mutandis, Oluić, cited above, § 36). The applicants fought a protracted battle in and out of the courts to obtain its enforcement (see paragraphs 27 ‑ 36 above). Their complaints to the police and to the municipal authorities also seemed capable of providing swift and effective redress in respect of the nuisances coming from the computer club, the electronic games club and the office. The applicable regulations empowered those authorities to intervene, stop the nuisances and sanction their perpetrators (see paragraphs 65 ‑ 69 above). Those procedures appear to be an effective, rapid avenue of redress, and could, if successful, have had the outcome that the applicants desired (see, mutatis mutandis, López Ostra v.

Working with a computer was normally a quiet occupation. The applicants ’ allegations of broken doors and damage to the entrance and the passageways were not supported by evidence such as photographs or police records. The same went for the allegations of alcohol consumption in the building ’ s courtyard. Even if such things had taken place, it was not clear that they had in any way been connected with the operation of the computer club. The desire of those who lived in the building that there be no commercial activities in it was understandable, because any such activity entailed visits by outsiders, and thus inevitably interfered with the peaceful enjoyment of the property and created a risk of hooligan intrusions. However, it was a matter of proof in each case whether such risks had materialised."

Unlike other cases examined by the Court, in the present case the operations of those outfits had been unlawful and unauthorised from the outset. The nuisances sustained by the Milevi sisters had been the most serious, owing to the location of their flat above the computer club. For years they had to endure day and night the noise generated by the computer club ’ s clientele, which could number up to three hundred people. The seriousness of the situation could be seen from the affidavits submitted by them. From August 2003 the Milevi sisters had in addition to endure the nuisances coming from the electronic games club, whose creation had entailed extensive works in the flat below theirs, with the pulling down of walls and the installation of high ‑ voltage electrical cabling and new windows. The resulting disturbances could be seen from a number of photographs submitted by the applicants and the affidavit drawn up by Mr Hristo Evtimov. While the disturbances coming from the flat converted into an office were obviously not as intense as the rest, they nonetheless aggravated the overall situation. The Evtimovi family, as a result of the location of their flat, had been disturbed only by the computer club. At first the main annoyance had been the noise generated by the club ’ s clients at night. After the club had moved to the other flat, which was closer to theirs, they had to endure the same interferences as the Milevi sisters. The fact that Ms Kalina Hristova had a young child made that all the more unbearable."

First, the authorities had designated the area in which the applicant lived as an “acoustically saturated zone”, which, under Spanish law, was an area where local residents were exposed to high noise levels causing them serious disturbance. Secondly, the fact that the maximum permitted noise levels had been exceeded had been confirmed on a number of occasions by the authorities. In Ruano Morcuende ( cited above ), concerning vibrations from an electric transformer installed in a room adjoining the applicant ’ s flat, the Court was likewise satisfied that Article 8 was engaged. By contrast, in Fägerskiöld v. Sweden ( (dec.), no. 37664/04, 26 February 2008 ), which concerned noise from a wind turbine, the Court found, on the basis of unequivocal data from tests carried out by the authorities, that the noise levels in the applicant ’ s house were not as high as to engage Article 8. It reached the same conclusion in Furlepa (cited above), which concerned noise from a car ‑ repair garage, on the basis of the applicant ’ s failure to put forward sufficient evidence. In Borysiewicz v. Poland ( no. 71146/01, §§ 52 ‑ 55, 1 July 2008), which concerned noise from a tailoring workshop, the Court likewise found that the applicant had failed to submit enough evidence to show that the level of noise in her home had exceeded the norms set by domestic law or by the relevant international standards, or had gone beyond what was inherent to life in a modern town. It came to the same conclusion in Leon and Agnieszka Kania v. Poland ( no. 12605/03, §§ 101 ‑ 03, 21 July 2009), which concerned noise from a lorry maintenance and metal ‑ cutting and grinding workshop, and in Galev and Others (cited above ), which concerned noise from a dentist ’ s surgery. More recently, in Oluić (cited above, §§ 52 ‑ 62 ), which concerned noise from a bar operating in the house where the applicant lived, the Court was satisfied, on the basis of a number of tests carried out over a period of eight years, that the level of noise there exceeded the maximum permitted under Croatian law and under the relevant international standards."

In the Court ’ s view, it cannot be assumed that the noise emanating from an office, whether emitted by office equipment, generated in the normal process of work, or resulting from staff and clients entering and leaving the premises, as a rule rises above the usual level of noise in a block of flats in a modern town. Moreover, any such disturbances are as a rule likely to be restricted to working hours and are unlikely to reach very high levels (see, mutatis mutandis, Galev and Others, cited above). The Milevi sisters have not put forward evidence showing that as a result of the operation of the office the level of noise in their flat has risen above acceptable levels. For those reasons, the Court finds that the alleged disturbances from the operation of the office were not sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8."

Greece, no. 41666/98, § 54, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI (extracts) ). There is no indication that the works in question lasted an unreasonably long time or were noisier than is usual for such works.

The evidence produced by the applicants shows that it operated round the clock, seven days a week, for a period of approximately four years. It also shows that the club ’ s clients, who must have been quite numerous, given that it had almost fifty computers, were generating a high level of noise, both inside and outside the building, and were creating various other disturbances (see paragraph 13 above). It cannot be overlooked that those activities, which may be seen as an natural corollary of the club ’ s operations, were taking place in and around a building which had an essentially residential character (see, mutatis mutandis, Oluić, cited above § 61 in limine ). In these circumstances, even though the case file does not contain exact measurements of the noise levels inside the applicants ’ flats, the Court is satisfied that the disturbance affecting the applicants ’ homes and their private and family lives reached the minimum level of severity which required the authorities to implement measures to protect the applicants from such disturbance (see, mutatis mutandis, Moreno Gómez, § 60, and Oluić, § 62, both cited above ).",

Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, § 86, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII). It should also be pointed out that, in view of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities in that domain, it is not in the Court ’ s remit to determine what exactly should have been done to stop or reduce the disturbance. However, the Court can assess whether the authorities approached the matter with due diligence and gave consideration to all competing interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, § 128). In carrying out that assessment, it will have regard to, among other things, whether the national authorities acted in conformity with domestic law (ibid., §§ 96 ‑ 98)."

The Court notes that despite receiving a number of complaints and establishing that the club was operating without the requisite licence, the police and the municipal authorities failed to take effective steps to ascertain the effect of its operations on the well ‑ being of those who, like the applicants, resided in the same building, or to exercise their powers (see paragraphs 66 ‑ 69 above) to check the nuisances resulting from the club ’ s round ‑ the ‑ clock operations, which appeared to be in clear breach of the regulations on noise in residential buildings ( ibid. ). On the contrary, on 26 June 2002 the municipality approved a plan for the conversion of the flat in which the club was located into commercial premises, without trying to establish whether the domestic ‑ law rules intended to reconcile the existence of commercial outfits in residential buildings with the well ‑ being of the persons living in such buildings had been complied with (see paragraphs 21, 50 and 51 above). It is true that the municipality subsequently subjected the club ’ s operating permit to the condition that its clients enter through the back door and not through the passageway used by the building ’ s residents (see paragraph 23 above). However, that condition was imposed at the end of November 2003, some two and a half years after the club had started operating, and there is no indication that the authorities took any steps to ensure that it was being complied with. According to the applicants, the condition could not be met owing to the building ’ s layout ( ibid. ), and the authorities later found that it was being completely disregarded by the club (see paragraph 37 above). Rules intended to safeguard guaranteed rights serve little purpose if they are not properly enforced (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 61)."

Following complaints by the applicants, on 2 July 2002 the building control authorities prohibited the use of the flat used as a computer club and ordered that its electricity and water supplies be cut off (see paragraph 25 above). Under the applicable law, that prohibition was immediately enforceable for the purpose of, as noted by the Supreme Administrative Court, protecting the health of those concerned (see paragraphs 32 and 53 above). However, as a result of the two decisions of the Sofia City Court to suspend its enforcement (both of which were later overturned on appeal) and of the passiveness of the authorities, the prohibition was never enforced, despite numerous requests by the applicants (see paragraphs 28 ‑ 33 above). Those developments, coupled with the inordinate protraction of the proceedings for judicial review of that prohibition ( instead of following a fast ‑ track procedure as required by domestic law, for nearly two years the Sofia City Court barely managed to hold two hearings (see paragraphs 27, 34 ‑ 36 and 53 in fine above) ), prevented the applicants from obtaining effective protection of their rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Giacomelli v.

They said that if they had not been forced to sell their original flat in March 2004 with urgency, they could have sold it later for a much higher price, which had been only partly offset by the concomitant increase in the market value of their new flat.

France, p. 262, and Hatton and Others, § 127, and contrast Baggs, p. 15, all cited above). There is nothing to indicate that the factors which caused the Milevi sisters to wish to move out of the flat would necessarily diminish its value in the eyes of a prospective buyer intending to put it to non ‑ residential use. Indeed, it cannot be overlooked that the flat was purchased by a company (see paragraph 9 above). Nor is it apparent that the applicants were forced to sell the flat in such urgency as to be unable to obtain a fair market price for it. The actual price agreed between them and the buyer could be the result of a multitude of factors about which the Court is unable to speculate.

                "101. As in Fadeyeva, the Court finds that the applicants'complaints in the present cases fall to be analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant's rights under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention (for more details see §§ 88 – 92 of the Fadeyeva judgment). Further, the Court considers that the continuing operation of the Severstal steel-plant contributed to the economic system of the Vologda region and, to that extent, served a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention (see Fadeyeva, §§ 98 – 100). It remains to be determined whether, in pursuing this aim, the authorities have struck a fair balance between the interests of the applicants and those of the community as a whole.",

            ],
            [
                "102. The Court recalls that in Fadeyeva it established that the Severstal steel-plant's operations did not fully comply with the environmental and health standards established in the relevant Russian legislation. The operation of the Severstal plant in conformity with the domestic legislation would be possible only if the zone, separating the enterprise from the residential areas of the town, continued to exist and served its purpose."
            ],
            [
                "103. In that case the Court considered two alternative avenues that could have been employed by the authorities in order to solve the applicant's problem: the resettlement of the applicant outside the zone and the reduction of the toxic emissions. As regards the resettlement, the Court found that little, if nothing, had been done in order to help the applicant moving to a safer area. As to the efforts of the authorities, aimed at reducing the pollution, the Court noted that a certain progress has been made since the 1980-s. However, the governmental programs and privately funded projects did not achieve expected results. Whereas, according to the 1990 Government Programme, the steel-plant was obliged to reduce its toxic emissions to a safe level by 1998, in 2004 the Chief Sanitary Inspector admitted that this had not been done and that the new deadline for bringing the plant's emissions below dangerous levels was henceforth 2015. During the period falling within the Court's competence ratione temporis (since 5 May 1998), the overall improvement of the environmental situation was very slow."

                "104. The Court accepted that, given the complexity and the scale of the environmental problem around the Severstal steel-plant, this problem could not be resolved in a short period of time. However, it did not mean that the authorities might remain passive. On the contrary, they had to take “reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants'rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8” ( Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ) in a shortest delay possible. Given the seriousness of the situation, the onus was on the State to show how it coped with the environmental problem. However, in that case the Government failed to do so. They did not show that the effects of the operation of the plant on public health and well-being were regularly monitored and the information obtained was shared with the population concerned. Further, the Government did not explain how the information available influenced their policy vis-à-vis the plant, and what that policy consisted of. Finally, the Government failed to show how the policy (if any) was enforced, which sanctions had been applied and for what kind of breaches. In these circumstances the Court drew adverse inferences and concluded that in regulating the steel-plant's industrial activities the authorities had not given due weight to the interests of the community living in close proximity to the premises of the Severstal steel-plant.",

                "105. Turning to the present cases, the Court observes that, as regards possible resettlement, the first, the second and the third applicants were in the same position as Ms Fadeyeva, since none of them has been resettled or received compensation for the resettlement costs."

            [
                "106. Ms Romashina, the fourth applicant, obtained a flat outside the zone in 200 0, free of charge. Therefore, it may be assumed that she had had to endure the adverse effects of pollution for a shorter period of time than the other applicants. Indeed, the resettlement may have solved her problem for the future. However, it did not put right the alleged breach of her rights during the antecedent period and the authorities did not acknowledge the alleged breach of her rights under the Convention, nor expressly neither in substance. Accordingly, this fact does not deprive the fourth applicant of the status required to claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention within the meaning of Article 34."

                "107. As regards measures of general character, undertaken by the Government in order to solve the problem of pollution, the Court notes the following. The Government referred to a number of studies carried out in order to assess the environmental situation around the Severstal steel-plant. However, the Government have failed to produce these documents or to explain how they influenced the public policy vis-à-vis the plant. The only relevant report produced to the Court (see paragraph 29 above) was commissioned in 2003 by the plant itself in order to delimit its sanitary security zone. The information contained in that report was definitely useful for defining the extent of the environmental problem and its consequences, but it did not impose any particular obligations on the plant or the State authorities."

            [
                "108. As regards other documents, produced by the Government, the Court notes that they reflect the company's environmental protection policy and the overall progress made in the recent years. However, this policy was not legally binding on the plant and its realisation to a great extent depended on the good will of the plant. The Court recalls in this respect that the central question of the present cases was how the State protected the applicants'rights under the Convention by regulating private industry. Since the interference with the applicants'rights persisted, it was of little relevance that the plant was willing to stop it and was taking practical steps in that direction. What is central for the present cases is how the State reacted to that situation, what legal mechanisms were employed in order to reduce the pollution to acceptable levels or, at least, to exclude those affected by the pollution from its effects."
            ],
            [
                "109. Pursuing that matter, the Court notes that the Government did not produce the plant's operating permit, licence or other documents which would establish the Government's policy regulating the plant's industrial activities. The Government did not explain how the plant's compliance with the operating conditions of its licence, permit or general environmental standards was monitored and how it was enforced. The Government's argument that the plant functioned in compliance with the domestic and international environmental standards is not convincing. Thus, the fact that the management system of the plant was certified by an international organisation does not mean that the plant's emissions were at acceptable levels. The same concerns the audit by the EBRD experts, referred to by the Government. Nor did the Government provide the Court with a copy of the audit report, neither it explained what had been the purpose of it and its findings and recommendations."
            ],
            [
                "110. Having examined the materials submitted to it, the Court notes that in the present cases the Government did not put forward any new fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a conclusion different from that of the Fadeyeva case. The Court concludes that, despite the wide margin of appreciation left to the respondent State, the authorities failed to take appropriate measures in order to protect the applicants'right to respect for their homes and private lives against serious environmental nuisances. In particular, the authorities have neither resettled the applicants outside the dangerous zone, nor have they provided for a compensation for those seeking the resettlement. Furthermore, it appears that the authorities failed to develop and implement an efficient public policy which would induce the steel-plant to reduce its emissions to the safe levels within a reasonable time. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

The plant was and remains the largest iron smelter in Russia and the main contributor to the environmental pollution: it is responsible for 95 -97 per cent of industrial emissions into the town's air. According to the annual report by the Federal Agency for State Statistics, in 2003 overall emissions from stationary sources of atmospheric pollution were 97 thousand tons for Moscow, a city of more than ten million people, and 349 thousand tons for Cherepovets, which counts less than 350,000 residents.

However, in 2000-2001 the concentration of several polluting substances in the air of the residential areas of the town still exceeded safe levels. At the same time the birth rate in the town was higher than the average in the country and the morbidity rate was lower. Most of the deceases registered in the town were not place-specific. However, prevalence of some chronic respiratory diseases was directly linked to the distance of the patients'houses from the territory of the steel-plant. The measures provided by the steel-plant in order to reduce emissions, would be capable of reducing health risks for the population of Cherepovets. If all these measures were implemented, by 2015 the concentration of pollutants in the air of the residential areas of the town could reach 1 MPL, which is the acceptable level.

Fourthly, the Government claimed that, although the law provided for suspension or cessation of industrial activities of the polluting enterprises, “such question has never come up” with respect to the Severstal steel-plant. Since the 1980-s, the volume of overall emission of the steel-plant was reduced almost to one third. The most dangerous industrial units were closed and the emissions of high-risk chemical substances were reduced by 100 times. Every year the “ Severstal ” PLC spent about 250 million Roubles on environmental protection programs. In 2000 the company was audited by the “Bureau Veritas Quality International”, an international organisation, which established that the system of the environmental protection management of the company was in conformity with international standards. Further, in 1999 the Severstal steel-plant underwent technical and ecological expertise of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). As a result, the operation of the steel-plant was recognised to be in conformity with EBRD standards.

In recent years the implementation of a number of federal and municipal programmes, as well as projects funded by the “ Severstal ” PLC resulted in a reduction of pollution in Cherepovets. Thus, in 1991 the proportion of “irregular samples” of the town's air was 37,6 per hundred. In 1998 it was 32,8 per hundred, and in 2004 only 23,6 per hundred.

They produced reports, prepared by the “ Severstal ” PLC for the general public, which described the plant's environmental policy and the progress made in recent years.

It was only after their applications had been lodged with the Court that the Russian authorities changed the regulations pertaining to the sanitary security zone of the Severstal steel plant. Consequently, the applicants submitted that they should be considered as having lived in the sanitary security zone at the material time.

Since 1996 no official inquiry into the environmental situation in Cherepovets, which could influence the Government's actions towards the resolution of environmental problems, has ever been carried out. The specific consequences of any official inquiries have never been stated by the Government and such information has not been made adequately publicly available.

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties'submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, 6 July 2005, with further references)."

The present four applications belong to this second category. There is no doubt that serious industrial pollution negatively affects public health in general. However, it is often impossible to quantify its effects in each individual case, and distinguish them from the influence of other relevant factors, such as age, profession etc. The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. The “quality of life” is a very subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition. Therefore, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court has no other choice than to repose thrust primarily, although not exclusively, in the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing factual circumstances of the case (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, pp. 1291-93, § § 74-7 7).

Although at the relevant time all of them lived at different addresses, their flats were located within the sanitary security zone of PLC “ Severstal ”, as defined by municipal decree no. 30. It should be noted that on 2 March 2000 the fourth applicant obtained a new flat from the authorities and moved outside the zone. The Court is thus prepared to accept that she is no longer exposed to dangerous levels of pollution. However, the interference complained of was of a continuing nature and lasted almost two years, if counted from 5 May 1998 (the date when the Convention entered into force with respect to Russia ). Therefore, her moving outside the zone did not by itself eradicate the adverse effects of her living there, and for a certain period of time she was in the same situation as other applicants (for further details see paragraph 106 below)."

However, it appears that at the time the applicants were unable to make an informed choice, or were not in a position to reject the housing offered by the State, or move elsewhere at their own expense (see the Fadeyeva judgment, § § 119 and 120 ). Thus, it cannot be claimed that the applicants themselves created the situation complained of or were somehow responsible for it (see also, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 105 et seq., ECHR 2004 ‑ ... )."

The Federal Program of 1996, which provided for the resettlement of the residents of the zone, is no longer in force. On these grounds on 12 July 2002 the Cherepovets Town Court rejected the first applicant's claims against the steel-plant. However, in the Court's view, it does not mean that the danger for the first and other applicants'health and well-being is no longer there. The de facto abolishment of the sanitary security zone was decided not because the concentrations of toxic substances reached safe levels, but on formal grounds. For almost ten years decree no. 30 was in force and applied by the courts. Its validity has not been called into question either by the steel -plant, or by the municipality itself. Moreover, on many occasions various domestic official bodies confirmed that the applicants lived in the territory of the sanitary security zone where concentrations of certain toxic substances were above acceptable levels and which was therefore unsuitable for human residence. At last, in their observations on admissibility and merits the Government admitted that the applicants'houses were located within the zone (see the decision on admissibility of the present cases of 16 September 2004 ). Thus, in the eyes of the Court, the annulment of decree no. 30 and ensuing changes in the legal status of the zone has no bearing on the applicants'situation from the standpoint of their complaints under Article 8 of the Convention."

The Government finally indicated that the applicants had not obtained appropriate reports from relevant State bodies confirming that the place where they lived was unfit for living and that this matter had not been discussed before the domestic courts. In this respect the Court notes, first of all, that the Government referred to the legislation which had been enacted in 2001 - 2003, which was after the applicant's cases had been examined by the domestic courts. Secondly, the Court reiterates that in the proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 8 9 above). The applicants produced a large number of other documents, official reports, letters of various State authorities, confirming that the concentration of certain pollutants near the applicants'houses was constantly above safe levels, established by the Russian legislation. Moreover, this fact is supported by the data produced by the Government itself (see above, paragraphs 27 et seq.). Finally, at the time when the domestic proceedings took place the existence of interference with the applicants'private sphere was taken for granted at the domestic level, since the law defined the territory where they dwelled as unfit for residence, and presumed that the concentrations of pollutants that they had been exposed to were unsafe."

In that case the Court considered two alternative avenues that could have been employed by the authorities in order to solve the applicant's problem: the resettlement of the applicant outside the zone and the reduction of the toxic emissions. As regards the resettlement, the Court found that little, if nothing, had been done in order to help the applicant moving to a safer area. As to the efforts of the authorities, aimed at reducing the pollution, the Court noted that a certain progress has been made since the 1980-s. However, the governmental programs and privately funded projects did not achieve expected results. Whereas, according to the 1990 Government Programme, the steel-plant was obliged to reduce its toxic emissions to a safe level by 1998, in 2004 the Chief Sanitary Inspector admitted that this had not been done and that the new deadline for bringing the plant's emissions below dangerous levels was henceforth 2015. During the period falling within the Court's competence ratione temporis (since 5 May 1998), the overall improvement of the environmental situation was very slow."

Given the seriousness of the situation, the onus was on the State to show how it coped with the environmental problem. However, in that case the Government failed to do so.

Further, the Government did not explain how the information available influenced their policy vis-à-vis the plant, and what that policy consisted of. Finally, the Government failed to show how the policy (if any) was enforced, which sanctions had been applied and for what kind of breaches.

Indeed, the resettlement may have solved her problem for the future. However, it did not put right the alleged breach of her rights during the antecedent period and the authorities did not acknowledge the alleged breach of her rights under the Convention, nor expressly neither in substance.

The only relevant report produced to the Court (see paragraph 29 above) was commissioned in 2003 by the plant itself in order to delimit its sanitary security zone.

As regards other documents, produced by the Government, the Court notes that they reflect the company's environmental protection policy and the overall progress made in the recent years. However, this policy was not legally binding on the plant and its realisation to a great extent depended on the good will of the plant. The Court recalls in this respect that the central question of the present cases was how the State protected the applicants'rights under the Convention by regulating private industry. Since the interference with the applicants'rights persisted, it was of little relevance that the plant was willing to stop it and was taking practical steps in that direction. What is central for the present cases is how the State reacted to that situation, what legal mechanisms were employed in order to reduce the pollution to acceptable levels or, at least, to exclude those affected by the pollution from its effects."

The Government did not explain how the plant's compliance with the operating conditions of its licence, permit or general environmental standards was monitored and how it was enforced. The Government's argument that the plant functioned in compliance with the domestic and international environmental standards is not convincing.

In particular, the authorities have neither resettled the applicants outside the dangerous zone, nor have they provided for a compensation for those seeking the resettlement.

The applicants claimed that they were under an obligation to pay Mr Vanzha certain amounts for his work. Mr Vanzha, in his turn, confirmed this claim by producing the calculation of his fees. Therefore, the Court concludes that the lawyer's fees are real."

Finally, the Court considers that since the individual situations of the applicants were quite similar, the preparation of their cases did not require as much time is indicated in the calculation produced by Mr Vanzha.

The Court has held that the conservation of the cultural heritage and, where appropriate, its sustainable use, have as their aim, in addition to the maintenance of a certain quality of life, the preservation of the historical, cultural and artistic roots of a region and its inhabitants. As such, they are an essential value, the protection and promotion of which are incumbent on the public authorities (see SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy v.

Turning to the circumstances of the instant case the Court recalls that the HVCA instituted court proceedings challenging the privatisation of the plot of land by Galina Bogdel, and its subsequent transfer to the applicants, in the name of protecting the public interest – the historical and cultural heritage of the State – since the site was on the State ’ s tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status. The Court further notes that the domestic court proceedings were in fact prompted by Trakai residents themselves, who were concerned that the plot of land had been misappropriated by the applicants who, moreover, intended to enlarge their property and to build a larger building on territory designated as an urban heritage site. That being so, the Court perceives nothing liable to refute the Government ’ s argument that deprivation of the applicants ’ title was “in the public interest”. It also reiterates its constant case-law to the effect that because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest” (see Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 87, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII )."

Even though not all of them have competence to bring an action in court to defend the public interest, the principles of the rule of law, cooperation among institutions, effectiveness and other principles of good administration require that, once a breach of the public interest has been established, an institution must inform a prosecutor or another competent body of the breach without undue delay ... The principle of the rule of law requires that the stability of legal relations be preserved. Such stability would be not guaranteed if persons could never be sure that court proceedings for [the annulment] of administrative acts adopted in respect of them could always be initiated. If State or municipal institutions acted with unjustified delay ... it would mean that the opportunity to initiate court proceedings to protect the public interest would become unlimited in time, and such situation is not possible in a State governed by the rule of law. Therefore, a court, having examined the balance to be struck between the values protected and the need to guarantee the stability of legal relations, may refuse to protect the public interest even in those cases where [the institution] has not missed [the statutory time limit] for bringing court proceedings (counting from the moment when the evidence of the breached public interest was gathered or should have been gathered ), if a sufficiently long period of time has passed since the administrative legal acts were adopted and legal relations were established. ”",

In particular, a significant period of time had elapsed between the time when the private person had obtained title to the plot in 1994 and when the State authorities had initiated court proceedings to annul her title. The court therefore refused to protect the public interest in order that the stability of legal relations would be preserved. It also noted that such a conclusion was supported by the practice of the Lithuanian courts, namely, the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s ruling no. A 10 -131/2007 of 6 February 2007, where it had held that the time-limit had been missed because eleven years had elapsed since the challenged administrative act had been adopted."

On this last point the applicants referred to the Court ’ s case-law to the effect that if a mistake was made by the authorities themselves, without any fault on the part of a third party, a different proportionality approach must be taken in determining whether the burden borne by an applicant was excessive ( see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 73, 15 September 2009). They also argued that the mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the defendant. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authorities must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned ( see, mutatis mutandis, Radchikov v.

On the contrary, in every case many other aspects had to be evaluated, for example, how the State property was used and whether it was in the public interest. In this connection, they submitted that most of the neighbouring plots of land in Karaimų Street in Trakai had been privatised by private persons who used them for economic and commercial activities. The applicants then challenged the pertinence of the territorial planning scheme in respect of Trakai old town, maintaining that their plot was no different from neighbouring plots and thus had no exceptional importance. The fact that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the State had leased that particular plot of land to them for eighty-seven years confirmed that ownership of the plot by the applicants and its use as a café would not conflict with any public interest."

Firstly, as had been established by the SAO, the plot of land had been transferred to Galina Bogdel ’ s ownership, and subsequently inherited by the applicants, in violation of numerous pieces of legislation and administrative regulations concerning territorial planning and protection of the cultural and historical heritage. That being so, there was a genuine and clear legitimate interest in having the plot returned to the State ’ s ownership : the impugned plot of land was located in an urban heritage area, a territory subject to the strictest legal protection and which was of unique cultural and historic value, situated in the heart of one of the most unique areas of cultural and historical heritage in Lithuania, the Trakai Historical National Park, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its decisions of 14 March 2006 and 9 February 2010 ( see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Moreover, the existence of a public interest was perfectly illustrated by the fact that the initiative for the annulment of the land purchase agreement had come not from the State authorities, but from the residents of Trakai town themselves, who were concerned that the historic old town was being destroyed ( see paragraphs 13 and 14 above ). In this context the Government also relied on the reasoning of the Court ’ s judgment in Moskal ( cited above, § 73) to the effect that public authorities should not be prevented from correcting their mistakes, even those resulting from their own negligence, because holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment."

Even though they had lost their title to the plot of land in question, their right of property in respect of the café they had built on that plot of land remained unchanged. Most importantly, after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the HVCA had granted the applicants ’ request and leased them the same plot of land for a period of eighty-seven years. That meant that the applicants had never been precluded from exercising their commercial activity on that land. It was also noteworthy that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the appellate and cassation courts had ordered full restitution, and the applicants had received the sum of LTL 2,874 which Galina Bogdel had paid for the plot. Given that the applicants had not questioned the adequacy of that sum in their appeal on points of law, it had to be considered that the sum was fair. Lastly, if the applicants considered that the sum was too low, it had been and still was open to them to seek damages from the State under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code."

It considers, however, that such a claim in separate civil proceedings, once civil proceedings as regards their title to the plot of land had been completed, would have placed a somewhat excessive burden on the applicants ’ shoulders.

These rules are not, however, unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and are therefore to be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Scordino v.

Moreover, the Court cannot find that the HVCA acted arbitrarily when instituting court proceedings for the annulment of the applicants ’ title to the plot of land at 41 Karaimų Street in Trakai.

Lastly, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicants have continuously remained the owners of the café built on the plot of land and have continued to be able to use that property. That being so, and observing that the applicants indeed did not dispute the adequacy of the sum they received before the Supreme Court, the Court finds that the applicants were fairly compensated for the Trakai municipality ’ s authorities ’ mistakes in privatising that plot of land in 1994-5 (see, by converse implication, Maksymenko and Gerasymenko v.

                "72. The applicants ’ main argument rested on what they saw as discrimination between private parties and the State with regard to the way the limitation period was applied by the Lithuanian courts in general, and in their case in particular. They noted that under Lithuanian law the right to bring an action could be enforced from the date on which a person became aware or should have become aware of a violation of his or her rights (Article 86 of the old Civil Code and Article 1.127 of the new Civil Code). Accordingly, the principle of equality of arms required that the same interpretation of the above-mentioned provision be applied both in cases where the claimant was a private entity and when the claimant was the State, represented by its officials or institutions. However, the domestic courts ’ decisions showed two different results in civil cases: when examining claims submitted by private entities, the limitation period for challenging the validity of a contract was considered to begin on the date when the parties became aware that the contract had been concluded (see paragraph 36 above), and when deciding claims lodged by State authorities, the courts took as the starting-point the date when the claimant had been provided with sufficient data to prove that a particular legal act or transaction was against the law, as in the case in issue (see paragraph 34 above)."

                "73. The applicants considered that such an interpretation by the domestic courts as to the beginning of the limitation period was contrary to the general aim and essence of the principle of statutory limitation, which was to ensure the stability of civil legal relations. Furthermore, from a practical point of view, such an interpretation was tantamount to a rule that the limitation period should not apply to claims submitted by the State regarding its property at all, because in practice it was almost impossible to miss a general limitation deadline of three or ten years calculated from the date the State institutions became aware and were provided with sufficient data to prove that a public interest had been breached. For the applicants, the above interpretation of the rules regarding the commencement of the limitation period embodied the idea that the State institutions were not obliged to verify the lawfulness of their decisions and transactions in due time. The State ’ s obligation to verify the decisions and transactions of its institutions was therefore not subject to a time-limit."

The applicants lastly contended that the domestic courts had erred in establishing that even after the administrative reform of 1995 county governors in general, and the HVCA in particular, did not have competence to and were not obliged to review the Trakai local authorities ’ decisions on the lease and sale of the disputed plot to Galina Bogdel. On that premise they therefore argued that the start of the limitation period should have been calculated as 10 February 1995 – the date when the land purchase agreement was concluded. In their case, however, the courts had become the advocates of the State by exclusively defending the interests of the public institution and ignoring the legal interests of another party – private persons."

The Government submitted that the domestic courts ’ decision to calculate the statutory limitation period from 3 July 2000 was fully compatible with the Convention in general and with the principle of legal certainty guaranteed by Article 6 in particular. They noted, firstly, that under Lithuanian law the limitation period started to run on the date on which the right to bring a civil action became enforceable, that is, the date when the person became aware of the violation of his right. That reasoning had been confirmed by the Supreme Court on a number of occasions (see paragraph 35 above). Similarly, when a case had been brought before a court in order for a public interest to be protected, the commencement of the limitation period was to be held to be the date when the claimant was provided with sufficient data to prove that a public interest had been violated (see paragraph 34 above)."

The Government also considered it important to note that it was not the State institutions which had been behind the initiative to verify the lawfulness of the land purchase agreement of 10 February 1995. It had in fact been the initiative of a private person, R.L., who had written to the SAO expressing his concerns about the applicants ’ business and the building work they intended to carry out."

They further observed that under the domestic case-law a court, having assessed the balance to be struck between the values to be protected and the need to ensure the stability of legal relations, could refuse to protect the public interest even in those cases where the State institution defending the public interest had complied with the limitation period for bringing a case before the court, if there had been an unjustifiably long delay between the adoption of certain administrative acts and the lodging of court proceedings (see paragraph 37 above). However, the case at hand was different, because a fairly short time – six years – had passed between the date the legislation on the protection of historical and cultural heritage was breached and the date the transaction was challenged in court. Moreover, the public interest at stake in the instant case was beyond comparison."

However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. It is also noteworthy that limitation periods are a common feature of the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States. They serve several important purposes, namely to ensure legal certainty and finality, protect potential defendants from stale claims which might be difficult to counter, and prevent the injustice which might arise if courts were required to decide upon events which took place in the distant past on the basis of evidence which might have become unreliable and incomplete because of the passage of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, §§ 50 and 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV)."

The role played by limitation periods is of major importance when interpreted in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, which, in its relevant part, declares the rule of law to be part of the common heritage of the Contracting States (see Dacia S.R.L. v. Moldova, no. 3052/04, § 75, 18 March 2008). The Court also reiterates that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as the prescribed time for lodging a court action. The Court ’ s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v. Greece, no. 38460/97, § 37, ECHR 2001 ‑ I; also see Ghirea v. Moldova, no. 15778/05, § 30, 26 June 2012 )."

It has given due consideration to the applicants ’ argument that calculating the limitation period from the date when the State or municipal authorities were provided with sufficient information to prove the fact of a violation, vis-à-vis the rule applied to private entities – that the limitation period started to run from the date when the contract had been concluded – is discriminatory. The Court cannot fail to observe that the applicants did not raise this particular discrimination-related complaint in their appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court, a copy of which it has examined with due attention. Even so, on the basis of the submissions by the Government and, above all, the Court ’ s conclusion in paragraph 67 above, it considers that the effect of such a distinction on the applicants was compatible with their “right to a court” under the Convention.",

In view of the foregoing, the applicant claimed that the demolition of his house without payment of any compensation had breached his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

However, in their opinion, this interference had been compatible with legal certainty and had aimed at ensuring compliance with the general rules concerning prohibitions on construction. In this connection, they noted that the construction permit for the building in question had been issued on 10 August 1976, in accordance with the Zoning Law. Yet, the permit had not been renewed although its validity had expired on 10 August 1980. The permit to use the building had not been obtained either. Accordingly, the applicant did not have “ possessions ” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since their acquisition had never been valid. In any event, it was impossible for the authorities to issue a permit for the applicant's house since it was located in the protected zone of the Kurtboğazı Dam, which supplied drinking water to Ankara. The interference in question had thus met the requirement of lawfulness and had not been arbitrary. It had pursued the legitimate aims of preserving the environment, protecting public health and ensuring compliance with building regulations, with a view to guaranteeing the orderly development of residential areas and the countryside."

Before embarking upon the question whether the deprivation concerned was justified in the circumstances of the case, the Court notes at the outset that the applicant purchased the house in question from its previous owner in 1996, relying on the records kept at the land registry office. The latter, which is the sole authority for the registration and transfer of immovable property, issued a title deed to him, attesting his ownership of the property (see paragraph 11 above). According to domestic law and practice, any limitation concerning such property must be entered in the land registry log book. The rights of those who acquire property relying on the records kept by the land registry office are protected and any damage resulting from the keeping of those records engages the responsibility of the State ( see paragraph 25 above)."

That being so, it does not appear that the applicant knew or ought to have known that the house was an illegal construction under the domestic law since the land registry log book did not contain any annotation concerning the illegality of the construction and limiting its transfer. Indeed, the Government did not dispute that. Having thus purchased the house in good faith and obtained a title deed, the applicant paid the appropriate taxes and duties on it. In other words, as holder of a title deed attesting his ownership of the house, the applicant had a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, without any restriction, until he was deprived of it by the local authorities."

In that connection, the Court notes that, although there is no provision in the Convention affording general protection for the environment, it has recognised that in today's society such protection is an increasingly important consideration (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192, p. 16, § 48). Furthermore, in a number of cases the Court has dealt with similar questions and stressed the importance of the protection of the environment (see, among many other authorities, Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, ECHR 2004 ‑ X; Moreno Gómez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004 ‑ X; Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). In view of the foregoing, and having regard to the reasons given by the national courts, the Court considers that it is beyond dispute that the applicant was deprived of his property “in the public interest”, namely to protect public health and the environment (see Lazaridi v. Greece, no. 31282/04, § 34, 13 July 2006 ). It follows that this deprivation of property pursued a legitimate aim."

                "44. It now needs to be ascertained whether the interference in question struck a fair balance between the interests of the applicant and those of society as a whole. The right to compensation under domestic legislation is material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this regard, the Court has previously held that a deprivation of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and that a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances (see N.A. and Others v. Turkey, no. 37451/97, § 41, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; Nastou v. Greece (no. 2), no. 16163/02, § 33, 15 July 2005; Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 111, ECHR 2005-VI)."

            [
                "45. In the instant case, the applicant did not have any realistic prospect of success in obtaining compensation for the deprivation of his property, given that the administrative courts upheld the Ankara Administrative Council's demolition order (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). The lack of any domestic remedy to afford the applicant redress for the loss of his house thus impaired the full enjoyment of his right to property. In this connection, the Court notes that the Government did not cite any exceptional circumstances to justify the total lack of compensation for that deprivation, even though the domestic legislation stipulates that the State is responsible for any damage resulting from the keeping of land registry records (see paragraph 25 above). Thus, having recognised the applicant as the legal owner of the house in question by issuing a title deed, the national authorities'responsibility was automatically engaged for the damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the demolition of his house."

            [

There has accordingly been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Sovtransavto Holding v.

Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII).

However, the present case concerns expropriation proceedings in which a part of the applicants'estate was subject to expropriation. It is normal in the course of such proceedings that compensation be assessed, taking into account all relevant factors such as a decrease in the value of remaining property due to any circumstances. The Court therefore considers that the applicants, who were a party to the expropriation proceedings and who submitted their objections concerning the compensation fixed in the course of these proceedings, were not obliged to institute separate civil proceedings in this respect.

As to whether the interference had been proportional, they maintained that the applicants only objected to the fact that their estate had not been expropriated in its entirety since, as they alleged, the house and its surrounding area were not agreeable for living in that they were situated too close to the motorway under construction. The Government submitted that these objections were entirely unfounded, since the applicants'remaining estate was presently situated 40 metres from the motorway and, on completion of the motorway, would be situated 80 metres from it. Furthermore, fourteen other houses were at a similar distance from the motorway and these houses had not been expropriated. Noise-protection measures had been envisaged. Finally, they contended that the applicants had not objected to the amount of compensation before the first-instance administrative body. In the Government's view, the applicants had obtained the market value of their property and the State had therefore satisfied its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No.1.

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Sovtransavto Holding v.

Poland [GC], no 31443/96, § 143, ECHR 2004-V), particularly where there is a direct link between the measures which an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and the effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII).

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Holy Monasteries (The) v.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants'remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants'interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings."

Thus, on account of the shortcomings in the domestic proceedings, the Court is unable to assess the applicants'claim for pecuniary damage. In this respect the Court specifically refers to the opportunity available to the applicants to request re-opening of the proceedings in accordance with section 428(a) of the Civil Procedure Act, which would allow for a fresh examination of their claims concerning the expropriation of their property. It is now for the applicants to make use of that opportunity.

Asbestos in its various forms was one of the substances kept in stock in Malta Drydocks ’ storerooms and ships incorporating asbestos as part of their structure regularly entered the docks (or ship repair yard) and were repaired there by workers. Repairs included breaking apart the asbestos casing that was used for insulation purposes, thereby releasing the particles into the surrounding air. Once a machine was repaired, it had to be reinsulated using asbestos retrieved from the store -rooms. Such repairs were carried out both on the ships themselves and in the MDC ’ s workshops."

The X -rays of some of the applicants also revealed pleural thickening, reticulo -nodular interstitial parenchymal texture in the lungs, and in some cases also pulmonary fibrosis, all of which are consistent with asbestosis. The results suggested that there was a strong probability of the presence of asbestos fibres in their stomach lining, as well as in other digestive organs. Moreover, apart from the physical difficulties such as exercise intolerance that were mainly related to respiratory problems, the presence of asbestos in their bodies made them prone to malignant mesothelioma, as was the case with Mr Attard, abovementioned.

Moreover, while it was true that the law did not provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage, known as “moral damage” in the domestic context (except for a few specific circumstances), and that such damages were not awarded in actions for tort, the way compensation was calculated allowed for the inclusion of non ‑ pecuniary damage, although this was not mentioned. One such example was awarding loss of future earnings, based on a loss of opportunities, which in the Government ’ s view was a veiled type of “moral damage”, that is to say, non-pecuniary damage as understood in the Convention case-law. Moreover, the Government considered that civil law did not prohibit such damage and cited two examples ( Dr J Pace noe vs The Prime Minister, Civil Court (First Hall), 1 June 2012, and Mario Gerada vs The Prime Minister, Civil Court (First Hall), 14 November 2012) in which the applicants had been awarded compensation for “moral damage” in cases involving breach of contract and unfair dismissal respectively."

Moreover, proposals had recently been made in Parliament to make provision for compensation for non-pecuniary damage in certain cases – proposals which would be pointless if the Government ’ s contention that such damage were not precluded were true.

The applicants contended that, although part of their claim could have been addressed by the ordinary courts, the courts with constitutional jurisdiction were not precluded from addressing the case to its full extent. They submitted that in Carmena Fenech vs Chairman of the Malta Drydocks, (cited above) one of the cases relied on by the Government, the claimant ( who was the widow of a dry - docks employee who had succumbed to malignant mesothelioma ) had been awarded out - of - pocket damages and compensation for loss of future earnings in respect of her husband. Thus, if she had wished to claim any compensation for non-pecuniary damage, she would still have had to lodge another claim with the courts with constitutional jurisdiction.

The Court reiterates that the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. It thus represents an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v.

Latvia ( dec. ), no. 8283/07, 4 June 2013). There is no requirement to use another remedy which has essentially the same objective (see T.W. v. Malta [GC], no. 25644/94, § 34, 29 April 1999). However, noting the strong affinity between Article 35 § 1 and Article 13, the Court has ruled that if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 75, ECHR 2002 ‑ I; Kudła, cited above, § 157; T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 107, ECHR 2001-V; and Rotaru v.

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Ananyev and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule on exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40).

As transpires from the general principles and the case-law of the Court already cited, in the circumstances of the present case concerning, inter alia, complaints under Articles 2 and 3, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress accessible to the applicants.

                "63. As to the ordinary civil proceedings in the form of an action in tort, the Court has no doubts about the possibility of bringing such an action against the Government and about the prospects of success of such an action as also transpires from the case-law submitted. Nevertheless, the Court notes that an action in tort which is perfectly capable of awarding material/pecuniary damage does not in general provide for an award of non ‑ pecuniary damage (“moral damage” as understood in the Maltese context). While it is true that the Government submitted two recent examples of such damages being awarded, they were unable to identify a legal provision for awards of such non-pecuniary damage. Moreover, against a background of decades during which the domestic courts have consistently interpreted Article 1045 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 22 above) as excluding non ‑ pecuniary damage, and in the light of the fact that one of these two judgments (delivered by the same judge) has been appealed against by the Government and is still pending before the Court of Appeal, an ordinary civil claim for damages in tort cannot be considered to be a sufficiently certain remedy for the purposes of providing any non-pecuniary damage which may be due for such breaches (see, mutatis mutandis, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, § 59, 23 July 2013). The Court further notes that loss of opportunity, to which the Government referred, is a type of pecuniary, and not non-pecuniary, damage. Lastly, it does not appear that the ordinary court in such an action would have had the competence or authority to give any other form of redress relevant to their complaints."

                "64. In so far as the Government pleaded that there existed an aggregate of remedies which the applicants did not exhaust, it is true that the Court has sometimes found under certain conditions that an aggregate of remedies sufficed for the purposes of Article 13 in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 ( see, for example, Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, § 338, ECHR 2011 (extracts) ). This concept generally refers to a number of remedies which can be taken up one after the other or in parallel and which cater for different aspects of redress, such as a civil remedy providing for compensation and a criminal action for the purposes of satisfying the procedural aspect of Articles 2 and 3 ( ibid. , § 337). The Court has also encountered the notion or system of applying for different heads of damages through different procedures and found no particular problem with such a system (see Dreiblats, cited above), both being available options."

            [
                "65. Turning to the present case, the Court acknowledges that an action in tort could appropriately address the issue of pecuniary damage (see paragraphs 22 and 6 3 above). The Court also considers that the remedy provided by the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction provides a forum guaranteeing due process of law and effective participation for the aggrieved individual. In such proceedings, courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. These courts can also make an award of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage and there is no limit as to the amount which can be awarded to an applicant for such a violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq v. Malta, no. 26771/07, § 69, 5 April 2011, in relation to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, in relation to Article 6). The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it. The Court is therefore satisfied that the existing legal framework renders the constitutional remedy capable, in theory at least, of affording, inter alia, appropriate compensatory redress concerning both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage."
            ],
            [
                "66. The domestic system thus offers one legal avenue which would have provided solely for pecuniary damage and another one which allowed for a finding of a violation, provided for all heads of damage, and, moreover, could have afforded any other means of redress relevant to the complaints at issue. The Court observes that it does not transpire that in such cases national law necessarily requires that ordinary civil proceedings be undertaken as a sine qua non before the institution of constitutional redress proceedings, and neither has this been claimed by the Government. The same was in fact held recently by the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction (see paragraph 26, in fine, above). The Constitutional Court ’ s decision, and, before that, the similar decision of the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction, declining the exercise of its jurisdiction was therefore not mandatory under procedural rules, or in accordance with any well-established case-law to that effect, but rather was a matter of discretion, that is to say it was based on the judgment of the judges sitting on that bench, as provided for in the Constitution (see relevant domestic law). It follows that there is nothing legally incorrect about the rulings of the constitutional organs, and the use of an ordinary remedy before the constitutional redress proceedings is not only customary but also desirable in order to avoid burdening the constitutional jurisdictions unnecessarily with cases. It may be that such an aim would be better achieved if the ordinary courts had the power to award also non-pecuniary (“moral”) damage. However, even though in the Maltese legal system the ordinary remedy was limited in scope, it cannot be considered ineffective if followed by constitutional redress proceedings, and therefore the existence of an effective aggregate of remedies cannot be denied."

The Court notes that, in Zavoloka it held, solely, that there was no right to non-pecuniary damage in circumstances such as those of that specific case, where the applicant ’ s daughter had died as a result of a traffic accident due to the negligence of a third party and where no responsibility, whether direct or indirect, could be attributed to the authorities."

Furthermore, in connection with the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the applicants ( apart from the family of Mr Attard and Mr Dyer ) were found to have pleural plaques in their lungs, were experiencing physical difficulties and were prone to malignant mesothelioma ( as occurred in the case of the deceased Mr Attard ) and they were challenging the Government for having failed to protect them against such negative consequences. Mr Dyer although not affected to date was at risk of suffering the same fate. For the purpose of seeking redress, they were confronted with the two possibilities available under the Maltese legal order, namely ( i ) instituting an ordinary civil action which could only partly redress their grievances (and which could have taken years to decide – in the Pellicano case the action was commenced in 1980 and was only finally determined ten years later) followed by constitutional redress proceedings which could redress the remaining unsatisfied claims or (ii) instituting constitutional redress proceedings which could deal with the entirety of their requests for redress. It has not been submitted that their applications before the courts with constitutional jurisdiction had no prospects of success; these courts could have chosen to exercise otherwise their discretion and take cognisance of the case, instead of declining to do so. Indeed, the latter course of action would appear to have been the most appropriate approach even from the perspective of domestic case-law (see paragraphs 25 - 26 and 47 above ) and probably the only approach possible in the case of Mr Dyer."

Consequently, in the circumstances of the present case and particularly in the absence of any pre-existing mandatory legal requirements ensuing from law or well-established case-law requiring the institution of civil tort actions before recourse to the constitutional organs (in circumstances such as those of the present case), the Court considers that the applicants cannot be held to blame for pursuing one remedy instead of two. Moreover, such an action would have also served the interests of economy of proceedings given that – in any event – the applicants would have been bound to go before the constitutional organs to obtain the full range of redress which they claimed."

The Court considers that this general wording used by the applicants does not specifically exclude, as the Constitutional Court seems to have held (see paragraph 17, in fine, above) non-pecuniary damage as understood in the Court ’ s case-law. On the contrary it must be taken as including both pecuniary ( “ material ” damage, consisting under domestic law of damnum emergens and lucrum cessans ) and non-pecuniary (“moral”) damage, the term ‘ pecuniary ’ used by the applicants meaning simply ‘ monetary ’ and therefore before the domestic courts the relevant applicants ’ request cannot be said to have been deficient."

Consequently it was difficult for the Government to provide any information about the extent of any information material given to the applicants at the time, since those persons administering the company at the time had by now retired or died. In any event the Government considered that they had not been responsible for not having disseminated information before the dangers of asbestos were known and generally accepted as correctly ascertained. Distinguishing the instant case from Guerra and Others (cited above ), they pointed out that no reports existed in this case.

In their view the legislative enactments, coupled with protective clothing (implying the provision of information), namely a mask similar to those used by workers exposed to volatile material - which admittedly could not be compared to modern equipment but which the Government had considered adequate for those days – had satisfied their obligations under Article 2.

                "The Court considers that this obligation must be construed as applying in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake, and a fortiori in the case of industrial activities, which by their very nature are dangerous. In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 71 and 90).",
                "Among these preventive measures particular emphasis should be placed on the public ’ s right to information, as established in the case-law of the Convention institutions. The relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89- 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 132 ).",
                "As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’ s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 134-35).",

The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 136-37).”"

Italy, no. 30765/08, § 96, 10 January 2012 ). In particular, the Court has affirmed a positive obligation of States, in relation to Article 8, to provide access to essential information enabling individuals to assess risks to their health and lives (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, §§ 57-60; López Ostra, cited above, § 55; McGinley and Egan, cited above, §§ 98-104; and Roche, cited above, §§ 157-69). In the Court ’ s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, §§ 57-60; and Vilnes and Others, cited above § 235). It has also recognised that in the context of dangerous activities, the scopes of the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention largely overlap (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 133). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 requires the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, § 216).",

Indeed, while admitting that all workers were exposed to some extent, the Government contended that after they had become aware of the relevant dangers, they had ensured that the applicants were not made to work on asbestos- laden ships, without submitting what other possible functions or work they had been assigned at their place of work or any details regarding the dates when they had ceased to work with such material.

Ireland [GC] no. 35810/09, 28 January 2014, §§ 152 and 168). In this connection the Court notes that the Government implicitly admitted to have known of these dangers in or around 1987, as they stated that as soon as they had become aware of the dangers associated with asbestos, laws were enacted to protect employees from these dangers as early as 19 87. Nevertheless, given that Mr Attard had left the dry docks in 1974, the Court must examine whether at the time while he was exposed, that is, at least in the early 1970s, the Government knew or ought to have known of the relevant dangers.",
                "The Court acknowledges that the ILO Asbestos Recommendation and subsequent Convention which contained the minimum standards applicable concerning the use of asbestos were adopted in 1986. Nevertheless, as in many cases, the adoption of such texts comes after considerable preparatory work which may take significant time, and in the ambit of the ILO after having undertaken meetings with representatives of governments, and employers ’ and workers ’ organisations of all member countries of the organisation. They are usually preceded by a number of guidelines, and before concrete proposals can be made there is a thorough search for a consensus between the stake holders, namely public authorities as well as employers and workers. It is also common knowledge that the issues surrounding asbestos have been greatly debated amongst stakeholders all over the world, and that given the interests involved, particularly economic and commercial ones, acknowledging its harmful effects has not been easy. In this connection the Court observes that up to this date a number of countries have not yet banned the substance and only thirty-five countries out of the one hundred and ninety-eight United Nations Member States have ratified the Asbestos Convention. It appears logical, that this cannot be taken to mean that the dangers of asbestos are today still unknown."

Thus, as to whether the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known in the early seventies, the Court must rely on other factors, most evident amongst them being objective scientific research, particularly in the light of the domestic context. The Court takes account of the list, submitted by the applicants, which contains references to hundreds of articles or other publications concerning the subject at issue published from 1930 onwards - many of them taken from reputable British medical journals. The Court observes that medical studies at the then Royal University of Malta were modelled on, and followed closely upon, the corresponding United Kingdom system, with many graduates in medicine continuing their studies in England and Scotland. Particularly in view of this situation, even accepting the Government ’ s argument - that is, that information was at the time not as readily available as it is today - it is inconceivable that there was no access to any such sources of information, at least, if by no one else, by the highest medical authorities in the country, notably the Chief Government Medical Officer and Superintendent of Public Health (as provided for in the, now repealed, Department of Health (Constitution) Ordinance, Chapter 94 of the Laws of Malta, see paragraph 42 above ). In fact, according to Maltese law it was precisely the duty of the Superintendent of Public Health to remain abreast of such developments and advise the Government accordingly. The Court, further, observes that it has not been submitted that there had been any specific impediment to access the necessary information. Furthermore, the Government failed to rebut the applicants ’ assertion with any signed statement by a medical expert or authority, who could have attested that the medical professionals in the country were, in or around the 1970s, unaware of these worrying medically related findings at the time.",
                "Moreover, the Pellicano judgment by the Commercial Court (see paragraph 35 above) is in itself an implicit acknowledgement by a domestic court that in the years preceding Mr Pellicano ’ s death in 1979 the authorities knew or ought to have known of the dangers of working with asbestos and that they had failed to provide adequate health and safety measures in that respect.",
                "Against this background, the Court concludes that for the purposes of the present case, it suffices to consider that the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known of the dangers arising from exposure to asbestos at least as from the early 1970s."

It follows that, by Government ’ s admission, up until 1987 no positive action was taken in the nearly two decades (four years in the case of Mr. Attard who left the MDC in 1974) during which the applicants had been exposed to asbestos."

                "In accordance with Regulation 16, no employer may use or suffer to be used any chemical or material which is toxic without the approval of the Superintendent of Public Health. The Government did not find it expedient to explain whether such approval had been sought or given for asbestos and, if so, on what grounds. Even if approval was given, by the Government ’ s implicit admission, asbestos continued to be used and employees continued to work on it.",

Moreover, no work should have been carried out unless such tests had been done. Again, the Government have not indicated that any such tests had ever been carried out in the workrooms (or elsewhere) where the applicants, like the other employees, had been exposed to asbestos.",

It was only the legislation enacted in 2003 and 2006 which introduced such measures, including ( but not limited to ) the duty to provide the applicants and people in their situation with information about the risks to health and safety which they were facing."

In the present case, however, the only practical measure that appears to have been taken by the State, as the employer, was to distribute masks, on unspecified dates and at unspecified intervals ( if distributed repeatedly at all ). The Court notes in this connection that the apparently disposable masks ( which were shown to the Court) were considered by experts in the Pellicano case to be of “inadequate quality” and “ did not take sufficient account of the state of scientific knowledge about the subject matter at the relevant time” (see paragraph 33 above).

Instead the Government, seemingly oblivious to the obligations arising from the Convention, opted to consider that it was not their responsibility to provide information at the outset and that anyone in such a work environment would in any case be fully aware of the hazards involved. The Court considers the latter statement to be in stark contrast to the Government ’ s repeated argument that they (despite being employers and therefore well acquainted with such an environment) were for long unaware of the dangers. The Court further finds inappropriate the Government ’ s contention that the distribution of the above - mentioned masks was an implicit source of information. Additionally, in relation to the Government ’ s reference to the information available at the OHSA, the Court notes that this authority was only created after the year 2000 and it could therefore not have been a source of information before that date.

The Court firstly draws attention to the domestic case-law on the matter (see paragraph 34 above). But more importantly, it notes that the Government have not provided any relevant information specific to the instant case. They did not submit whether the applicants in the present case had been entitled to such compensation and if so whether they had accepted it or received it. Neither has it been submitted or shown that, because they were not working on asbestos from a specific date onwards, they were not entitled to compensation.

Malta, no. 20287/10, § 78, 22 November 2011 and Bellizzi v. Malta, no. 46575/09, § 44, 21 June 2011).

The remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. In particular, its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 95, Reports 1996-VI, and Aydın v. Turkey, 25 September 1997, § 103, Reports 1997 ‑ VI).

Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, § 98, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII), and the mere fact that an applicant ’ s claim fails is not in itself sufficient to render the remedy ineffective ( Amann v.
