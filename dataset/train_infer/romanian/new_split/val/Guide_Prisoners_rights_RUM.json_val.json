                "63. In the final analysis, the Court takes the view that the applicant ’ s continued detention is not in itself incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, but that the national authorities have not provided him with the care required to avoid subjecting him to treatment contrary to that provision. In view of his severe disability and the fact that he suffers from urinary and faecal incontinence, the length of time during which he was detained without receiving any rehabilitative treatment, and his inability to take a shower without the help of a fellow prisoner, are factors that have subjected the applicant to hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. Those circumstances amount to degrading treatment and thus to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The absence of any indication that the authorities acted with the intention of humiliating or debasing the applicant does not alter that finding in any way ( see Farbtuhs, cited above, §§ 50 and 60).",

He added that the full body searches carried out whenever he received visits and when he was escorted outside the prison were deeply humiliating; he was obliged to have his nappy inspected, and in order to proceed more quickly, several warders carried out this task together. During one inspection, a senior warder had said in front of everyone that “the boss had given instructions to inspect his nappy”.

The prisoner currently “ assigned ” to that duty was the third since his admission to the prison, and the applicant was dependent on him for supplying incontinence products, accompanying him to the showers ( there was a step preventing unassisted wheelchair access ) and cleaning his cell. This level of dependency and the problems associated with his incontinence complicated his relationship with the orderly. Going to the shower was a stressful time because the structure did not shield him from the view of others and his incontinence exposed him to extremely humiliating situations, causing irritation or even hostility on the part of his fellow inmates, who were unwilling to put up with such inconvenience in the course of their personal hygiene activities."

The management had refused to give the slightest undertaking about the conditions in which he would be accommodated in Roanne and the care he could be given there. They had been unable to provide any guarantees as to care arrangements as there were six cells for disabled prisoners at that facility and they were all occupied, and a single physiotherapist came to the prison for four half-days a week to provide services for five hundred prisoners. The applicant contended that he had not applied for a transfer on the grounds that the prison in question did not offer appropriate care facilities and would simply have represented a further upheaval and ordeal for him following his repeated moves from one prison to another ( twelve transfers between 2002 and 2009).

Examining the provision in question, the Court of Cassation specified in a judgment of 28 September 2005 ( Criminal Division, 05-81.010) that the convicted prisoner ’ s condition necessarily required a poor short-term prognosis. In a judgment of 7 January 2009 (Criminal Division, 08-83364) the Court of Cassation held that in rejecting an application by a disabled prisoner for the suspension of his sentence, the Post-Sentencing Division of the Amiens Court of Appeal had not justified its decision on the basis of Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since it had not determined, as the applicant ’ s submissions had invited it to do, whether the two expert opinions indicated that the actual conditions of his detention were incompatible in the long term with his state of health.

The question concerned the alleged interference with the ordinary courts ’ duty to protect personal liberty in so far as they were bound by the medical experts ’ two concurring opinions; the fact that the measure could be granted only if there was no serious risk of reoffending; and the lack of clarity of the provision in terms of respect for human dignity. The Criminal Division found that the question raised had no serious merit, for the following reasons :",

In his annual activity report for 2012 the Inspector General of Detention Facilities ( contrôleur général des lieux de privation de liberté – CGLPL) included a chapter on “ old age, invalidity and disability in prison ”, in which he noted that people in these categories were excluded by the very nature of prison architecture and the organisation of everyday prison life. He explained that cells for prisoners with reduced mobility were often located on the ground floor, which was normally set aside for prisoners under the “closed doors” regime; this was not conducive to any communication. The daily routine was a further source of anxiety : “ fear of being confronted with violence, fear of a primarily young population, fear of going to the exercise yard. Boredom too, since an occupational activity is no longer accessible to them and the activities available are unsuited to their physical condition. And finally, the humiliation of being dependent. Although many facilities have signed agreements with associations providing personal assistance, there are still too many prisons where the duties of ‘ attendant ’ or domestic help are performed by other prisoners employed by the prison management – the ‘ prison orderlies ’; this situation is unacceptable on account of the risks of blackmail and the lack of appropriate training and remuneration .”",
                "The CGLPL advocated a rethink of the architecture and living arrangements at detention facilities, but emphasised that consideration should be given to allowing these types of prisoners to serve their sentences in a non-custodial environment. He also recommended that “ the suspension of sentences on medical grounds be better adapted to the reality of the situations it may cover”. Among the targets of his criticism in that respect were the restrictive conditions laid down in Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which the execution of a sentence could be suspended only in extremely serious cases and as a short-term measure. He added : “ It must be noted that the experts assigned to assess whether the prisoner ’ s health is compatible with continued detention do not take sufficient account of the physical conditions of incarceration, quite simply because they are entirely unaware of the constraints it entails ”. He recommended that Parliament amend Article 720-1-1 “ to introduce a third possible criterion besides the risk to life and the long-term incompatibility of the prisoner ’ s health with detention, namely granting a request for suspension of a sentence where the treatment required by the prisoner cannot be provided either in detention or even during periods of ordinary or escorted prison leave, because of its repetitive and regular nature ”."

On 20 November 2013 the Justice/Health Interministerial Working Group submitted a report to the Ministers of Justice and Health on “ Adjustments of sentence and suspensions of sentence on medical grounds ”, which recommended, among other things, extending the scope of the suspension of sentences on medical grounds by giving greater consideration to disabilities in the examination of such applications : “ The working group agrees on the need to specify in the practical guide that the suspension of a sentence on medical grounds is applicable to individuals whose disability is incompatible in the long term with detention and that due regard should be had in this assessment to the actual conditions of ordinary detention ( reference is made to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Cassation). It is recommended that the experts be provided with all possible means in order to determine whether the prisoner ’ s health is compatible with the conditions of ordinary detention. While some members of the group wanted to include a specific reference to disability in the text of Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, others are of the view that disability can already be taken into account under the existing provisions.”",

                "31. Reference is made to the judgments in Mouisel v. France ( no. 67263/01, § 26, ECHR 2002 - IX) and Rivière v. France (no. 33834/03, § 29, 11 July 2006) for the provisions governing health care in prison. It should be noted that health care for prisoners has been the responsibility of the public hospital service since the Law of 18 January 1994 came into force. Outside appointments and emergency and short-term hospital admissions take place at the hospital to which the UCSA – an internal unit of the hospital based in the detention facility – is attached. Any treatment that is unavailable at the UCSA is provided either at the local hospital or in one of the eight secure interregional hospital units ( unités hospitalières sécurisées interrégionales – UHSI) or the National Public Health Institution in Fresnes (EPSNF). The UHSIs are responsible for providing medical and surgical treatment for detainees referred by UCSA medical personnel for stays of more than forty-eight hours. The EPSNF has medical, aftercare and rehabilitation departments and admits prisoners whose health requires an extended hospital stay or major therapy ( see Guide du prisonnier (Prisoner ’ s handbook), OIP, 2012, section on “ La médecine générale ” ). In its 2014 annual report the Court of Audit included a chapter entitled “ Detainees ’ health: further progress still essential”, in which it outlined the arrangements for admitting detainees to hospital and noted, among other things, the “ poor take-up of somatic hospital capacity ”, and especially the under -occupation of the UHSIs. The report also mentions “ an approach to health care that is all too often dependent on the operation of the prison system ”, and concludes that “ in addition to the rigidity and constraints of the prison environment, the available treatment is still inadequate, the need for more modern premises and equipment is not satisfied and the forms of cooperation between the parties concerned are fragile and incomplete ”. Furthermore, it calls for “ the development of a stronger and clearer public ‑ health policy ” through the assistance of regional health agencies, which “ assess and identify detainees ’ health-care needs. They define and regulate the provision of health care in a prison environment.”"

Article D. 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that prisoners can be transferred either at the request of the governor of the prison where they are serving their sentence or at their own request. A Prison Service circular of 21 February 2012 on the assignment of detainees to custodial facilities specifies the procedure for applying for a transfer. Article D. 360 of the same Code deals with transfers of prisoners to a facility better equipped to cater for their condition. Article R. 57-8-6 of the Code concerns the rights of prisoners with disabilities. The two last-mentioned provisions are worded as follows:",

The person thus designated must give express consent. ...",

It does not specifically mention problems linked to the situation for people with disabilities. With regard to the more general question of personal hygiene, the CGLPL observed that “no particular difficulties for prisoners have been noted. The showers are permanently accessible for prisoners under the ‘ open doors ’ regime, and once a day for prisoners under the ‘ closed doors ’ regime in B building.” He noted that the exercise yards were similar in all the wings of the prison, comprising a yard, two or three concrete benches, a concrete table-tennis table and an area for playing boules. They had “ Turkish” (squat) toilets, which were inaccessible for prisoners with certain types of disability. In buildings C and D, there had for a long time been unrestricted access to the exercise yard, and prisoners had been able to come and go as they pleased. This was no longer the case. Set opening times had been introduced, and prisoners were required to enter the yard at the start of the time slot and leave at the end, with no other option : from 9 to 11 a.m., 2 to 4 p.m. and 4 to 5.30 p.m. The report also noted that “no physiotherapists have visited the prison since the retirement in 2009 of the person who previously performed this service. Several prisoners have complained about this. ”",

The applicant submitted firstly that the conditions of his imprisonment undermined his dignity, and drew attention in that connection to the position taken by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences and the Post-Sentencing Division and challenged by the Government, to the effect that his continued detention was conditional on the availability of premises catering for his disability and the accessibility of appropriate treatment. The Government ’ s position was all the more unacceptable as the courts in question had merely examined the most immediately visible aspects of his situation, namely the configuration of the premises and the treatment available to detainees. Referring to the reports by the CGLPL and the Justice/Health Interministerial Working Group mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, he submitted that the competent authorities ’ assessment of dignity was limited to the question of the provision of care rather than covering practical living conditions. However, his state of complete dependence on the prison orderly, the conditions in which he took a shower, the security measures imposed on him whenever he was escorted outside the prison and the full body searches all amounted to repeated humiliation undermining his personality. All these measures had been found to be inhuman and degrading by the Court ( the applicant cited Vincent v. France, no. 6253/03, 24 October 2006; Khider v. France, no. 39364/05, 9 July 2009; and Duval v. France, no. 19868/08, 26 May 2011), and the same conclusion had to be reached in his case, in view of the cumulative effect of the ill-treatment and his disability, as well as the complete lack of justification for the security measures imposed on him."

Regarding the quality of care provided, the applicant observed that the Government had acknowledged that no physiotherapy sessions had been available until 2012 and had provided no details as to their frequency after that time. He asserted that the treatment provided was derisory ( see paragraph 21 above ), even though the experts and doctors had repeatedly stressed the consequences of failure to provide suitable treatment for his condition. A transfer to Roanne Prison would not guarantee him any better treatment. The cells set aside there for prisoners with reduced mobility were all taken by severely disabled prisoners. The applicant also noted that one prisoner in a wheelchair had committed suicide in that prison in November 2012, and that in any event the doctors had recommended that he be admitted to a specialist facility for his rehabilitation."

As to whether his continued detention was appropriate, the applicant complained that Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been read in a restrictive manner that conflated dignified conditions of detention with sufficiency of treatment. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal had based its findings on a ground not provided for by the Article in question for refusing a request for suspension of execution of a sentence, namely failure to acknowledge the offence. Relying on Gülay Çetin v. Turkey (no. 44084/10, 5 March 2013), he emphasised that there were no clear provisions of domestic law that required consideration to be given to personal capacity to cope with detention regardless of the quality of treatment needed, or that allowed situations infringing human dignity to carry on indefinitely. The intensity of the ordeal inflicted on a person with disabilities amounted to disregarding the purposes of the sentence, instead turning it into pure retribution and an indiscriminate punishment. The UCSAs ’ task was in no way to remove their patients from the reality of their existence but rather to provide diagnosis and treatment."

They also detailed all the occasions when the applicant had been admitted to hospital or escorted outside the prison ( see paragraph 16 above ), and the steps taken to ensure that a physiotherapist came to Uzerche Prison from September 2012 ( see paragraph 17 above ), submitting in conclusion that the conditions of his detention in relation to his state of health could not be deemed to amount to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention."

These obligations are set out very clearly in Xiros v. Greece ( no. 1 033/07, § 73, 9 September 2010; for a more recent authority, see Ürfi Çetinkaya v. Turkey, no. 1 9866/04, §§ 87 - 92, 23 July 2013) and may be summarised as follows."

                "48. With regard to the first obligation, in a State founded on the rule of law fitness for detention is the prerequisite for pursuing the execution of a sentence. Although this cannot be construed as a general obligation to release detainees or transfer them to a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat, the Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies in the form of humanitarian measures. Accordingly, in exceptional cases where the state of a detainee ’ s health is absolutely incompatible with his or her detention, Article 3 may require the release of that person under certain conditions ( see Xiros, cited above, § 74).",
                "As regards the second obligation, the lack of appropriate medical care may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court requires, firstly, the provision of relevant medical support for sick detainees and appropriate medical treatment for their specific ailments. The promptness and frequency with which medical care is provided to such prisoners are two factors to be taken into account in assessing whether they are being treated in a manner compatible with the requirements of Article 3. In particular, these two factors are not assessed by the Court in absolute terms, but with due regard for the prisoner ’ s particular state of health in each case. In general, the worsening of the prisoner ’ s health does not in itself play a decisive role as regards observance of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court examines in each case whether the deterioration of the prisoner ’ s health was attributable to inadequacies in the medical care provided ( ibid., § 75).",
                "As regards the third obligation, the Court requires the prison environment to be adapted, where necessary, to the prisoner ’ s specific needs so that he or she can serve the sentence in conditions that do not undermine his or her psychological well-being ( ibid., § 76).",

The post-sentencing courts subsequently found that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions for having the execution of his sentence suspended, while taking care to note that the prison where he was detained was not suited to his circumstances.

Having regard to the foregoing, the Court observes that it has not been ruled out that the applicant could receive physiotherapy in a prison setting ( contrast Cara-Damiani, cited above, § 74). The Court observes that the applicant ’ s disability was taken into account in the assessment of his application for suspension of his sentence, which was rejected on the basis of concurring medical opinions concluding that his condition was not incompatible in the long term with detention provided that he was given physiotherapy and access to a gym. In addition, the courts found that Uzerche Prison manifestly failed to satisfy the requirements for the applicant ’ s detention regime, in terms of both the premises and the availability of paramedical care ( see paragraphs 11 and 13 above ). The Court notes in that connection the developments in domestic law and in the positions taken by official bodies as to the need to take account of disabilities when considering applications for the suspension of sentences ( see paragraphs 27, 28, 29 and 30 above ). Lastly, it observes that it does not appear from the case file that the applicant ’ s health has deteriorated during his detention or that his disability has worsened as a result of the detention conditions. In particular, the report on the visit to Uzerche Prison by the CGLPL ( see paragraph 33 above ), which does not deal specifically with the situation for people with disabilities, does not suggest that the conditions there are such as render the applicant ’ s continued detention incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, should the applicant ’ s health deteriorate, French law affords him the opportunity to submit a fresh application to have his sentence suspended on medical grounds, a process that Parliament has recently relaxed with a view to making it easier to use ( see paragraphs 27 and 28 above ).",
                "Accordingly, the present case does not concern the question of the applicant ’ s fitness to serve his sentence, but rather the quality of the care provided, and in particular whether the national authorities did everything that could reasonably be expected of them to provide him with the rehabilitative treatment he needed and to offer him some prospect of an improvement in his condition."

On this specific point, no substantiated arguments have been submitted to the Court, in particular regarding the reason given by the appropriate authorities for refusing to allow the applicant to purchase such a device himself, which he is apparently in a position to do ( see paragraphs 16 and 22 above ) in the absence of any complaints on his part as to whether the device could be covered by the social-security system ( contrast, for example, V.D. v.

With regard to the physiotherapy prescribed by all the doctors who examined the applicant, the Court observes that they unanimously recommended daily rehabilitation sessions and access to a gym. However, the applicant did not receive any paramedical care of this kind until September 2012 – that is, for a period of more than three years following his admission to Uzerche Prison – on account of the lack of qualified staff at the institution. It was also very difficult for him to go to the gym since it was not wheelchair accessible, as the Government explained. The Court would note that the application for suspension of the applicant ’ s sentence was refused subject to his receiving appropriate physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, and that the domestic courts pointed out on that occasion that such treatment could not be provided at Uzerche Prison, but in other custodial facilities ( see paragraphs 11 and 13 above ). The UCSA doctors emphasised that the applicant ’ s rehabilitation should take place in a specialist environment ( see paragraph 21 above ). The Court is not in a position to assess whether an ordinary prison without admission to hospital (see paragraph 31 above) would constitute an appropriate setting, but it must ascertain whether measures were taken by the prison authorities to offer the applicant the treatment prescribed by the doctors."

The Court observes that while the responsibility for ensuring the presence of a physiotherapist at the prison lies with a separate authority from the Prison Service, this cannot justify such a lengthy period of inaction and on no account releases the State from its duties towards the applicant.",
                "The Court further observes that the Government have not shown that any effort was made to find a solution whereby the applicant could be transferred to another prison or a specialist setting. It cannot accept the Government ’ s argument that the failure to transfer the applicant to such a facility, in particular to Roanne Prison, was entirely his own fault. Admittedly, the applicant ’ s assertion that it would not have possible to provide him with the necessary treatment in that prison can only be regarded as speculation; the parties ’ observations on this issue differ considerably since they referred to the situation at that prison at different times ( see paragraphs 25 and 26 above ). It is likewise true that the applicant did not formally request a transfer but decided against doing so, firstly in June 2010 because, according to the Government, his “main motivation related to the previous decisions of the judicial authorities on requests for suspension of sentences, rather than to the treatment he might receive”, and then in August 2011, for unclear reasons ( see paragraph 26 above ). However, the Court does not consider that this attitude amounted to a refusal of treatment : it notes that in August 2011 the applicant was awaiting the outcome of his court application to have his sentence suspended, which might explain why he did not make any requests to the prison authorities at that time. Furthermore, although Article D. 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that prisoners may request a transfer to another custodial facility more suited to their medical condition, it provides above all that the responsibility for such a transfer lies with the interregional director of the Prison Service, who is to order “ any transfer ... with the aim of enabling a sick prisoner to receive treatment in more favourable conditions ” ( see paragraph 32 above ). However, it does not appear from the case file that any specific measures were taken during that entire period or that any efforts were made to allow the applicant to undergo physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, despite the repeated recommendations of the UCSA doctors that he be provided with care in a specialist setting ( see paragraph 21 above ). The attitude of the applicant, who was apparently reluctant to seek a transfer for reasons including the distance from his family (see paragraph 25 above), cannot in itself justify the inaction of the prison and health-care authorities in failing to cooperate ( see paragraph 31 above ) to provide him with the care deemed necessary by the doctors who had examined him. The Court further notes that the physiotherapy he has received since September 2012 is limited to one weekly fifteen-minute session ( see paragraph 21 above ).",

Nor has the applicant indicated that he has suffered any hardship in moving around the different wings of the prison, which the Court notes is equipped with a lift that he can use where necessary ( contrast Arutyunyan v. Russia, no. 4 8977/09, §§ 78-79, 10 January 2012). Although it does not appear from the case file that the applicant often leaves his cell, the Court cannot infer from his observations any specific problems attaining the level of severity required for Article 3 to be applicable as far as his movements around the facility are concerned, including access to outdoor exercise."

                "60. It remains for the Court to examine the part of the complaint concerning : the searches performed on the applicant and the measures taken when he was escorted outside the prison, all of which in his view constituted repeated acts of humiliation; his access to the showers; and the arrangements for assisting him."
            ],
            [
                "61. Firstly, with regard to the body searches and security measures which the applicant was required to undergo whenever he was transferred to hospital, the Court points out that he did not complain about this issue in his initial application, raising it only in his observations, to which the Government responded by providing additional information about the frequency of and reasons for such transfers ( see paragraph 20 above ). It has already acknowledged that measures of this kind may reach the minimum level of severity required by Article 3 to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment ( see Khider, cited above; El Shennawy v. France, no. 51246/08, 20 January 2011; and Duval, cited above ), but it does not consider that this level has been attained in the present case; the Government ’ s additional observations on this issue indicate that the applicant was not searched systematically but on specific occasions during his detention, some of which concerned all prisoners at the facility. Moreover, only two decisions ordering searches when the applicant was escorted from the prison for medical reasons have been produced to the Court. Having regard to the reasons given by the Government to justify these occasional measures ( see paragraph 20 above ), which were not always aimed at the applicant alone, the Court considers that, despite their arduous nature, they do not appear to have attained the requisite level of severity for Article 3 to be applicable. The Court observes in this connection that the conditions and procedures complained of in relation to the transfers and searches of the applicant are not comparable to those observed in other similar cases ( see Duval and El Shenawy, cited above; Mouisel, cited above, §§ 46 and 47; and Hénaf v. France, no. 65436/01, §§ 54 - 58, ECHR 2003 - XI)."
            ],
            [
                "62. Secondly, as regards access to the sanitary facilities, and more specifically the showers, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaint is that since there are no such facilities in his cell, he is unable to go there unaided but is dependent on the assistance of a fellow inmate, a situation that exposes him to humiliation vis-à-vis the prison orderly in question and other prisoners on account of his incontinence. The Court does not have any information about the precise situation regarding the showers or the frequency with which the applicant can use them. However, it has not been disputed by the Government that he is unable to go there on his own ( see paragraph 23 above ) and that they are not designed to be accessible to people with reduced mobility. It can also be inferred from the applicant ’ s condition that the prisoner responsible for assisting him on a day-to-day basis according to the Government (see paragraph 42 above) has to help him to get washed. This state of affairs, where the showers are not wheelchair accessible and the applicant has to rely on a prison orderly to get washed, has been deemed unacceptable by the CGLPL ( see paragraph 29 above ). Furthermore, while legislation passed in 2009 made it possible for any prisoners with disabilities to designate a helper of their choice ( see paragraph 32 above ), the Court observes that a measure of this kind, assuming that the conditions governing such a choice have been satisfied in the present case, is not sufficient to meet the applicant ’ s needs, since having a shower is an uncomfortable occasion for him in view of his incontinence, the lack of privacy and the role of the prisoner designated to assist him ( see, mutatis mutandis, D.G. v. Poland, cited above, § 177). Indeed, it does not appear from the evidence before the Court that such assistance complements the care provided to the applicant by health-care professionals, or that the prisoner designated to assist him has received the necessary training to perform the actions required to accompany a disabled person. The Court observes in this connection that it has held on several occasions that assistance from a fellow inmate, even on a voluntary basis, does not mean that an applicant ’ s special needs are satisfied and that the State has on that account discharged its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. It has pointed out that it could not endorse a situation where prison staff evade their safety obligations and duty of care towards the most vulnerable prisoners by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with day-to-day assistance or, where appropriate, emergency care; such a situation gives rise to anxiety and places the prisoner in a position of inferiority vis-à-vis the other prisoners ( see Farbtuhs, cited above, § 60, and D.G. v. Poland, cited above, § 147)."
            ],
            [
                "63. In the final analysis, the Court takes the view that the applicant ’ s continued detention is not in itself incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, but that the national authorities have not provided him with the care required to avoid subjecting him to treatment contrary to that provision. In view of his severe disability and the fact that he suffers from urinary and faecal incontinence, the length of time during which he was detained without receiving any rehabilitative treatment, and his inability to take a shower without the help of a fellow prisoner, are factors that have subjected the applicant to hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. Those circumstances amount to degrading treatment and thus to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The absence of any indication that the authorities acted with the intention of humiliating or debasing the applicant does not alter that finding in any way ( see Farbtuhs, cited above, §§ 50 and 60).",

Similar petitions were lodged on 21 January and on 9 March 2005.

Mr Shulgin had been questioned in the course of the preliminary investigation and was initially included in the list of prosecution witnesses. The request arose following the court’s decision to admit a letter from Mr Shulgin which sought to discredit the defence expert Mr Shchekin (in the judgment the court referred to Mr Shulgin’s letter as one of the reasons why it did not accept Mr Shchekin’s evidence). Furthermore, Mr Shulgin had previously revoked a tax audit because it had failed to take into account a directive from the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Taxes stating that promissory notes could be accepted in 1999. His evidence therefore went to the heart of the corporate tax evasion charges.

That study had been seized by the GPO but not attached to the case materials. Mr Bochko produced a copy of that report to the court; the defence asked the court to attach it to the materials of the case. That study concluded that, far from causing any damage, the granting of the tax concessions had been positively beneficial. The granting of tax concessions had made it possible to rescue the Lesnoy town economy from a state of permanent crisis. In particular, the experts concluded that the refund of tax overpayments by Yukos promissory notes “had not caused damage to the town and federal budgets” and that the Lesnoy town trading companies had been entitled to pay tax in advance since this was the “unconditional right of a taxpayer”. Further, the experts concluded that the Lesnoy town administration was entitled to accept tax payments by way of promissory notes in 1999. The report also came to a conclusion that the trading companies registered there were all lawfully entitled to claim tax exemptions under the federal law relating to taxation in closed administrative territories."

The report did not mention their names and was not signed by them. Mr Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young who testified before the court, named those persons in his oral submissions, but since they had not signed the report, it was impossible to establish their role in the preparation of the report and their qualifications. The only signature on the report was that of the general director. Furthermore, the report had been obtained at the request of ALM-Feldmans law firm, which was not participating in the criminal proceedings. The cover-letter with which that report was forwarded to ALM-Feldmans was irrelevant.

On the same day the court refused to admit this document in evidence. The court noted that the “other documents” mentioned in Article 74 of the CCrP had to have relevance for the case. Having reviewed the report produced by Mr Pleshkov the court concluded that it “contained opinions of certain persons based on investigations and qualification of the documents on the questions provided by the defence, a part of which were questions of legal character”.

Most of the persons who had set up those companies on their behalf worked at Yukos, Menatep, Rosprom, and other affiliates of Yukos. In that capacity those persons were subordinated to the applicants. Further, the sham companies had no financial resources of their own, but operated with the financial support of Menatep, Rosprom, and Yukos. The sham companies did not have premises or personnel; they did not make a profit and some of them had been definitively liquidated or abandoned.

To reach Krasnokamensk from Moscow involved a minimum of two days. It was a long and strenuous journey, made even more difficult by the infrequency of flights from Moscow to Chita. A flight from Moscow to Chita took approximately six and a half hours (occasionally more, when the aircraft had to refuel in Yekaterinburg). On arrival in Chita, there was a seven-hour wait before boarding a train for Krasnokamensk, which took another fifteen hours to arrive. Alternatively, the visitors had the choice of a train ride from Moscow, 106 hours on an uninterrupted run.

The Constitutional Court held that the law may legitimately introduce certain limitations on lawyer-client confidentiality, including perusal of their correspondence. However, such limitations should not be arbitrary, should pursue a legitimate aim and should be proportionate to it. Legitimate aims may include preventing further criminal activity by the accused and preventing him from exerting pressure on witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice. The general rule is that lawyer-client correspondence is privileged and cannot be perused. Any departure from this rule is permissible only in exceptional circumstances where the authorities have valid reasons to believe that the lawyer and/or his client are abusing the confidentiality rule. Further, the Constitutional Court specified that the prison authorities should have “sufficient and reasonable grounds to believe” that the correspondence contains unlawful content and that they may peruse such correspondence only in the presence of the persons concerned and on the basis of a written motivated decision. The results of the inspection of the mail should also be recorded. At the same time the Constitutional Court ruled that any correspondence addressed by a detainee to his lawyer but not submitted “through the prison administration”, as provided by the federal law, may be checked by the prison administration."

The latter company was registred in the ZATO of the town of Ozersk and operated on the basis of a preferential taxation agreement concluded with the town administration. The court of cassation noted that under the ZATO Act, in order to be eligible to tax cuts, the company should have at least 90 per cent of its assets and carry out at least 70 per cent of its business activities on the territory of the ZATO at issue; in addition, 70 per cent of the average number of personnel on payroll should be from ZATO, while at least 70 per cent of wage should be paid to workers who are permanent residents of ZATO. The court found that 70 per cent of the average number of staff in the company were ZATO residents and that they received more than 70 per cent of wages paid by the company. The central argument for the Tax Inspectorate was that the business activity of the defendant company (which consisted of processing and re-selling of oil-products) was not carried out on the territory of ZATO and that it was done by the industrial facilities which did not belong to the defendant company. The court however, rejected that argument as irrelevant and held that those factors did not affect eligibility of the defendant company to tax cuts."

However, Article 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs does not make tax cuts conditional on the character of business activities, ‘productive’ or others.

In addition, the company concluded a rent agreement with the Municipal Property Department of the ZATO concerning non-residential premises located in Snezhogorsk....

All the above circumstances as such did not exclude that the company was carrying out its activities on the territory of the ZATO and are irrelevant for the case at hand, since they are not taken into account by the tax law in order to define conditions for tax cuts.",
                "The fact that the first-instance court and the court of appeal examined those circumstances demonstrates that they interpreted Section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs wrongly and went beyond [the mere examination] of conditions explicitly referred thereby for obtaining tax cuts. In breach of Article 3 (7) of the Tax Code the lower courts [wrongly] assumed that since the law did not refer to other criteria for defining whether the business activity was carried out on the territory of ZATO other than the presence of fixed assets, personnel and wages [there], the tax inspectorate or the court could establish such criteria by themselves.",
                "The argument of the Tax Inspectorate that the Director General of the company had no permanent place of residence in the ZATO is equally irrelevant, since Section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs makes tax cuts conditional of the fact that 70 per cent of staff of the company-taxpayer lives in the ZATO, but not necessarily the director of the company taxpayer.

At the same time, the decision of the Tax Inspectorate of 2000 indicates that the company was brought to tax liability following a “desk” tax audit – i.e. solely on the basis of documents submitted by the taxpayer. The documents submitted by the company to the Tax Inspectorate demonstrated that the company satisfied all requirements of section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs. The Tax Inspectorate, within a “desk” tax audit, was not empowered to visit premises of the company. Although after the decision bringing the company to tax liability the Tax Inspectorate conducted an “on-the-site” tax audit of the company, its results cannot be used to support the conclusions of the decision of 2000. The court of cassation also held that it was wrong to shift on the company the burden of proof that it had indeed carried out its business activities on the territory of ZATO. Although it was possible to request the taxpayer to submit additional documents, in the case at hand it had been done simultaneously with rendering the decision on bringing the company to tax liability.

It introduced inter alia a “patent” system for self-employed businessmen, who, instead of paying a variety of different taxes and submitting complex tax declarations, were only required to buy every year a “patent” (licence) for a particular type of activity, provided that their yearly proceeds do not exceed a particular amount (100,000 times the statutory minimum wage). The price of the licence thus constituted a nominal annual advance tax payment (calculated as a multiple of the State defined minimum wage), and exempted the entrepreneur from further taxation (including state insurance premiums) in respect of the licensed activity income. Under Article 1 of the Act, the businessmen eligible for the “licence system” were free to choose it or to remain within the “traditional” taxation framework.

Under that agreement Mr K. was supposed to work as a general manager of the taxpayer company, in exchange of a fee. Mr K. was registered as an individual entrepreneur; at the same time he was the sole owner of the Vliran Ltd (i.e. the taxpayer company). As a result, the service agreement had his signatures on behalf of both sides: he signed it in the capacity of an individual entrepreneur and in the capacity of the sole owner of the company. The fees paid by the company to Mr K. were included in its declaration as “costs”. The Tax Inspectorate considered that these fees could not be regarded as “costs” on the ground that the service agreement between the company and Mr K. was null, since it was signed by the same person on both sides. The court of cassation, however, ruled in favour of the taxpayer company. It held, in particular, that the charter of the company did not provide for the position of a general director, and that his functions could therefore be transferred to an external person. Furthermore, there was nothing in the law to prevent the company from “outsourcing” the managerial function to somebody else. The court ruled that there was no evidence that the company acted in bad faith, and the service contract was therefore valid.",

In particular, any further restriction of a prisoner’s rights must be linked to the actual harm the prisoner has caused in the prison setting. During solitary confinement there should, for example, be no automatic withdrawal of rights to visits, telephone calls and correspondence or of access to resources normally available to prisoners (such as reading materials). Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, the CPT considers that the principle of proportionality requires that it be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, no higher than 14 days for a given offence, and preferably lower. Prisoners undergoing solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should be entitled to at least one hour’s outdoor exercise per day, from the very first day of placement in solitary confinement, and should also be permitted access to a reasonable range of reading material (for further details see Razvyazkin v. Russia, no. 13579/09, § 89, 3 July 2012). On the last point the 21 st General Report reiterated recommendation made in respect of the Russian Federation in the Report on the 2001 visit to the Russian Federation (CPT/inf (2003) 30), made public on 30 June 2003, where it urged the Russian authorities in § 119 to “take steps to ensure throughout the country that prisoners placed in disciplinary cells have access to reading matter.”"

Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; in any event, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible.”"

The reason for his placement in the isolation cell was the fact that he had complained to the Prosecutor General about the actions of Mr Tagiev, the director of the remand prison. Thus, Mr Tagiev, who had submitted the information about the conditions in the isolation cell, definitely had an interest in providing an untrue account. The applicant believed that the documents appended to the Government’s memorandum had been drawn up by persons who were not disinterested.

In assessing whether the treatment inflicted on a prisoner went beyond the “inevitable element of suffering or humiliation” associated with the deprivation of liberty, the Court often took into account the cumulative effect of various aspects of prison life ( Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-II). In previous cases the Court analysed such factors as access to natural light or air in the cells, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements, the opportunity to use the toilet in private and the availability of ventilation (see, for example, Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, §§ 70-72, ECHR 2001-III; Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; and Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, § 84, 12 June 2008). That list is not exhaustive; other conditions of detention may lead the Court to the conclusion that the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded and the applicant was subjected to “inhuman or degrading treatment” (see, for example, Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, § 68, 25 October 2005; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007; and Slyusarev v. Russia, no. 60333/00, § 36, ECHR 2010-...).

In that case the applicant, who was detained in isolation for many years, was considered to be one of the most dangerous terrorists of his time. The Court had to assess whether, in view of the danger he represented, “the measures taken [i.e. isolation] were necessary and proportionate compared to the available alternatives” (§ 136). In Ensslin, Baader and Raspe v.

Some of the submitted documents mentioned that the applicant had refused to go to the shower (see paragraph 57 above). Whatever the real reason for imposing a disciplinary sanction, the Court considers that the applicant’s fault, if any, was not particularly serious and did not probably call for such a measure (see in this respect the CPT’s recommendation that such a serious punishment as solitary confinement should be commensurable to the disciplinary offence for which it was imposed, paragraph 455 above). The Court reiterates that although it is not for the Court to specify which security measures may be applied to prisoners, “the absence of any substantive reasons” for placing a detainee in a solitary confinement cell for a considerable period of time can be a relevant factor for characterising this form of disciplinary punishment as “inhuman and degrading treatment” (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, § 211, 10 April 2012; see also Razvyazkin, cited above, § 107)."

In particular, the Court takes it as accepted that the cell had a window measuring 90 x 60 cm. It is questionable whether such a window would provide enough natural light for a cell measuring 5.5 square metres. The permanent electric light in the cell may have been very disturbing for a detainee, and the one-metre distance between the open toilet pan and the sleeping place was clearly insufficient. Furthermore, the applicant had been deprived of all social contacts, could not read books or magazines or watch TV (see paragraph 452 above), and could not lie down on the bunk-bed, since it was unfolded only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m."

However, the Court is not required to resolve this factual controversy on those points. Even if the applicant’s description of the other conditions of detention was accurate, and even if such conditions might indeed be very uncomfortable, it is crucial to note that the situation complained of lasted for only seven days (cf. with Popandopulo v.

It was therefore possible for the applicant to prepare tea, coffee or instant food during the day.

The Government’s reference to certain “security risks” was too vague and was not supported by any specific fact. It appears that “the metal cage in the ... courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant’s placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated” (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, cited above, § 127). Furthermore, the applicant’s own safety or the safety of the co-accused was not at stake. Finally, the applicant’s trial was covered by almost all major national and international mass media, so the applicant was permanently exposed to the public at large in such a setting.

The meeting was scheduled for 10 a.m. on 2 July 2003; however, ten minutes before the start of the interview the applicant’s lawyer called the investigator to inform him that the applicant had been taken to hospital. According to a certificate from the Vishnevskiy Hospital, however, the applicant was admitted there at 12.56 p.m., and not at 9.50 a.m. as he had alleged. During his examination at 3.20 p.m. the doctors observed an improvement in his condition, describing it as “satisfactory”.

In 2003 Yukos managers persuaded her to leave Russia for Cyprus and paid for her to stay there. In 2004 she returned to Russia and was arrested. The Government further noted that the applicant’s accomplices had left Russia and did not intend to return. According to written testimony by Mr Glb., a Yukos manager, obtained in 2007, in 2003 the first applicant had met him and persuaded him to leave Russia. Later he had been told not to return to Russia. He understood that the Yukos security service had its personnel sent to London and considered that move as a personal threat to his security."

The applicant had access to private jets at Vnukovo airport, and it would have been relatively easy for him to leave secretly the hospital where he had been admitted. He had access to foreign currency through “the plastic cards emitted by foreign banks”. The authorities had also relied on the applicant’s position within the company. Given that most of the evidence and testimony in the case could have been obtained only from the company’s staff, it had been important to keep the latter out of the applicant’s reach."

The length of the applicant’s detention was due to the complexity of the case and the need to examine carefully the arguments of both parties. The defence lawyers protracted the period of detention by deliberately delaying the examination of the case-file. The investigation was closed on 22 August 2003, i.e. two months after the opening of the case; however, the defence finished examining the file only on 25 March 2004, i.e. seven months later.

The Moscow courts had nowhere acknowledged the principle of the reduced likelihood of absconding the longer the pre-trial detention continued; had failed to identify precisely how the applicant would be able to interfere materially with witness evidence; had nowhere conducted the essential balancing exercise between the ongoing and prolonged deprivation of liberty against the risks involved.

In addition, it had been established in the case file that the applicant kept most of his money in accounts with Russian banks, while using his foreign bank accounts in strict compliance with Licence no. 32-05-1190/97 of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. The applicant had not had access to the company’s private jets. In any event, owing to his status, the applicant could have used the services of any airline in the world.

Given the complexity of the case and the fact that there were no long periods of inactivity in the course of the proceedings, that period does not in itself appear unreasonable.

The Court found that some of the arguments put forward by the Russian courts were questionable, whereas others were “not devoid of merit”. Assessing the reasons invoked by the Russian authorities as a whole and having regard to the overall length of the applicant’s detention accrued by the time of the examination of the first case, the Court accepted “that the Russian authorities had not failed to give sufficient and relevant justification for the applicant’s continued detention.” The question before the Court in the present case is whether the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were sufficient to justify the second applicant’s detention from 10 September 2004 onwards, i.e. until 16 May 2005."

In that judgment the Court outlined the general principles of its case-law governing the application of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see §§ 182-186). It held, in particular, that when choosing a measure of restraint for the first time a court may rely on relatively loose presumptions of fact, and that the existence of a potential risk, for example, the risk of fleeing, cannot be demonstrated with the same degree of certitude as the existence of a fact that has already occurred (see §§ 188 et seq.). Having examined the first detention order in respect of the first applicant, the Court acknowledged that the domestic authorities had little time to evaluate the possibility for applying alternative measures of restraint, and that, although not flawless, the first detention order provided sufficient justification for the applicant’s detention on remand."

                "503. The Court noted further that in the subsequent period the first applicant’s personal situation had evolved, and that some of the risks mentioned in the original detention order ceased to exist. The Court stressed, in particular, that “the Russian courts on two occasions failed to indicate reasons for the continued detention of the [first] applicant, they relied on material obtained by way of a violation of the lawyer-client privilege, and never seriously considered other measures of restraint.” On the last point the Court held as follows:",
                "“194. ... The Court observes that at no point during the whole period of the applicant’s detention did the District Court or City Court take the trouble to explain why it was impossible to apply bail or house arrest to the applicant, or to accept ‘personal sureties’.",
                "195. There is no single standard of reasoning in those matters, and the Court is prepared to tolerate an implicit rejection of the alternative measures at the initial stages of the investigation. However, the time that had elapsed since the applicant’s arrest should have given the authorities sufficient time to assess the existing options, to make practical arrangements for their implementation, if any, or to develop more detailed arguments as to why alternative measures would not work. Instead, the Russian courts simply stated that the applicant could not be released ...",

The applicant was accused of a number of non-violent crimes; he did not have any criminal record and he lived permanently with his family in Moscow, where he had his main business interests.",
                "197. In sum, the domestic courts ought to have considered whether other, less intrusive, preventive measures could have been applied, and whether they were capable of reducing or removing completely the risks of fleeing, re-offending or obstructing justice. Their failure to do so seriously undermines the Government’s contention that the applicant had to be detained throughout the whole period under consideration”.",

In their submissions the Government described in detail the circumstances of the second applicant’s arrest and claimed that his behaviour at that point, as well as his informal exchanges with his lawyers had been indicative of his inclination to flee (see paragraph 489 above). However, the Court notes that these arguments did not constitute part of the domestic courts’ reasoning. The Government further referred to the testimony of potential witnesses who had fled the country, allegedly at the insistence of the Yukos management (see paragraph 491 above). The Court notes that that testimony was collected only in 2007-2008 and, consequently, had not been relied upon by the domestic courts in 2003 ‑ 2005. The same concerns information about credit cards issued by foreign banks in the applicant’s name, real-estate abroad and private jets which had allegedly been at the applicant’s disposal at Vnukovo airport: those factual elements were not mentioned in the extension orders under examination. The Court reiterates in this respect that “it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in [the detention orders] and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3” (see, for example, Wiensztal v. Poland, no. 43748/98, § 50, 30 May 2006). In the present case the Court will take into consideration only those arguments and information which were explicitly relied upon by the domestic courts in their decisions (see paragraphs 47 et seq. above) and which the applicant had an opportunity to discuss in the domestic proceedings."

During the period under consideration the domestic courts extended the second applicant’s detention with reference to two risks: the risk of tampering with evidence and the risk of absconding. As to the former, the Court notes that by June 2004, when the trial started, all documentary evidence had been already seized by the prosecution, all prosecution witnesses and experts had been questioned and their recorded testimony had been submitted to the court. By the end of 2004 the court had completed its examination of evidence collected by the prosecution. These developments significantly reduced the risk of tampering with evidence. Furthermore, throughout 2004 the main assets of Yukos were attached and sold at auction (see the Yukos case, §§ 92 et seq.). Thus, the second applicant ceased to exercise de facto control over the company; his ability to influence the company’s personnel was accordingly reduced. Despite those changes the domestic courts continued to repeat the reasons set out in their earlier detention orders."

However, the existence of that risk was not convincingly demonstrated in the extension orders. Thus, the mention of the second applicant’s “international connections” was too vague and was not supported by any evidence. The Court stresses that, given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the domestic courts were in a position to take a closer look at the second applicant’s alleged “international connections” and explain it in their decisions (compare Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 187, 22 December 2008, and Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § 126, 12 March 2009). The reference to the second applicant’s character “was not accompanied by any description of the applicant’s character or an explanation as to why it made his detention necessary” (see Polonskiy v. Russia, no. 30033/05, § 152, 19 March 2009). The fact that other Yukos managers and shareholders had left Russia might probably have been relevant at the initial stage of the investigation, but “the fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account” (see Sizov v. Russia, no. 33123/08, § 53, 15 March 2011). Furthermore, the Court notes that “the behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee’s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee” (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 76, 1 June 2006)."

This Convention provision proclaims not only the right to “trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial” but also lays down that “release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial” (see Jabłoński v.

In the present case the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the second applicant’s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure, such as bail, house arrest, or other measures provided by the Russian law, and “the context of the case was not such as to make the applicant obviously “non-bailable” (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 196, with further references)."

The Court observes that the applicant was represented by a group of highly professional lawyers, that the hearings were adjourned for one or two hours each time when the defence asked for it, and that the defence did not seek extra adjournments (see paragraph 49, 51 and 53 above). The Court concludes that even though the prosecution had more time to develop their arguments, given the nature of the proceedings, this disparity between the parties did not perturb the principle of equality of arms to an extent incompatible with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention."

                "521. The second applicant complained that his appeals against the detention orders were not examined speedily by the court of appeal. The Court reiterates that under Article 5 § 4 a detainee is entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention must be decided speedily by a court (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 82-88, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, §§ 34-39, 30 November 2000). Where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 § 4; at the same time, the standard of speediness “is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal.... The Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees” (see Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 179, 5 June 2012). In the case of Mamedova, cited above, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the “speediness” requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days respectively, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, § 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v. Russia, no. 27193/02, §§ 112-114, 24 May 2007, and Lamazhyk v. Russia, no. 20571/04, §§ 104-106, 30 July 2009). By contrast, the length of appeal proceedings that lasted ten, eleven and sixteen days was found to be compatible with the “speediness” requirement of Article 5 § 4 (see Yudayev v. Russia, no. 40258/03, §§ 84-87, 15 January 2009, and Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247). Finally, the Court reiterates that the delay for which the State may be held responsible should not include the time when the defence was preparing their brief of appeal (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247), unless the defence was prevented from finalising it through the fault of the authorities (see Lebedev (no. 1), § 100)."

                "522. Turning to the present case the Court reiterates that a similar complaint by the second applicant concerning earlier detention orders has already been addressed in Lebedev (no. 1). In that case the Court held that delays of forty-four and sixty-seven days, of which twenty-seven and forty ‑ seven were attributable to the authorities, constituted a breach of Article 5 § 4 (see §§ 98-108). During the period now under examination the detention order of 10 September 2004 was reviewed within twenty-three days, if calculated from the date when the brief of appeal was introduced (see paragraphs 49 et seq. above). The detention order of 14 December 2004 was reviewed by the City Court within twenty-six days. The detention order of 2 March 2005 was examined by the City Court within twenty days from the date when the brief of appeal had been introduced, and only twelve days out of this period can be attributed to the State, since the defence requested an adjournment of the appellate hearing."

Only the review of the extension order of 14 December 2004 warrants the Court’s attention. In Mamedova a similar delay was found to be in breach of Article 5 § 4, and the Court does not see any reason to hold otherwise in the present case. The Court has not overlooked that the applicant in casu introduced his appeal during the period of long public holidays (New Year and Orthodox Christmas). However, public holidays are not a good excuse for delaying the examination of an application for release (see E. v. Norway, judgment of 29 August 1990, § 66, Series A no. 181‑A)."

The second applicant’s main grievance was that the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction had failed to explain why his detention had been necessary. The Court has already addressed this problem above under Article 5 § 3.

There are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial: the first consists of seeking to determine a particular judge’s personal conviction or interest in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, for example, Gautrin and Others v. France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998-III; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII)."

In applying the second test the Court often observed that “even appearances may be of a certain importance”, although the standpoint of the accused is not decisive, and what is determinant is whether the fear of partiality may be held to be objectively justified (see Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, § 182, 3 May 2011).

Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant’s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co-accused’s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court’s assessment of the applicant’s guilt.

The applicants retained several highly professional lawyers, who had access to the materials of the case for almost six months for the first applicant and even longer for the second. The applicants and their lawyers repeatedly signed forms acknowledging that they had been allowed to study the materials of the case without any time restrictions. The applicants’ defence teams were allocated special rooms in the remand prison in order to enable them to prepare for the trial. These rooms were equipped with safe-boxes, where the defence was allowed to keep the materials of the case-file. The applicants were studying the materials in parallel with their lawyers; according to a letter from the head of the remand prison, the defence could ask the administration to make copies of the materials in the case file. In addition, the applicants were entitled to make notes and take materials from the case file to their cells, and transmit written comments to the lawyers, under the conditions established in sections 17, 18, 20 and 21 of the Detention on Remand Act. The second applicant had always had paper, writing accessories and law books at his disposal. The Government denied that the second applicant had not been allowed to use a magnifying glass or a calculator: although, as a rule, detainees could not have such objects, the applicant had been allowed to use them during the court hearings and when he studied the case file."

When the court asked the parties’ opinion about a possible adjournment on this ground, the applicants left that question to the court’s discretion. When any new material was added to the case file during the trial, the court always adjourned the hearing and provided the defence with an opportunity to study it. Throughout the entire trial the applicants and their lawyers had access to the materials of the case file. They never declared that they were unable to participate in the examination of evidence because they were unfamiliar with the materials of the case.

The second applicant’s case-file contained 164 volumes, each volume contained 250 pages on average, i.e. there were about 41,000 pages in total. Two bills of indictment constituted another two volumes. At the trial, after the two cases had been joined, the first applicant received 22 working days to study 165 volumes of case materials from the second applicant’s case, whereas the second applicant had to study 228 additional volumes within that period. The bill of indictment had covered a period of over ten years, and the case was extremely complex, both legally and factually. Although there was a commonality in the charges faced by the applicants there were also significant differences. It was therefore imperative for the applicant’s lawyers to scrutinise the additional materials. Some documents, of course, appeared in both sets of files, but it was necessary to look through all of the volumes to understand which documents had already been studied and which had not."

In addition, the defence had only been permitted to use certain meeting rooms, even when others were vacant, which was very suspicious. The Government’s assertion that the applicant was able to give written comments to his lawyers was misleading, in as much as it omitted to mention the fact that all such comments had had to be passed through a special division of the detention facility - i.e. lawyer ‑ client confidentiality had systemically been violated. The applicants were not allowed to have their own copy of the case file. It is to be noted that they would have been able to have their own copy had they been released on bail rather than detained. The applicants had been entitled to read the case file only in the presence of the investigator. When the applicants wished to discuss the documents in private with their lawyers the investigator had removed the documents. The temporary absence of a magnifying glass and a calculator had seriously impaired the preparation of the defence of the second applicant. The applicants were very largely reliant on the notes that they had made when they were reviewing the case files in the presence of the investigator. They were in theory permitted, upon request, to receive photocopies of the materials in the case file but in fact they were provided with only a very small number of copies of pages from the case materials.

In the court room, the applicants were entirely reliant on their lawyers showing extracts of the case file to them through the bars of the iron cage in which they were kept. The only way that the applicants were able to access the case materials during the trial was to request an adjournment of the trial.

If one of the lawyers was studying a particular volume of the case-file in the premises of the GPO, the applicants were unable to study that volume at the remand prison. Although the applicants were allowed to take handwritten notes, it was impossible for them to make photocopies. The lawyers, by contrast, were allowed to make photocopies, but mostly for their own use. If they needed to give a copy of a document to the applicants, this was possible only through the remand prison administration and, in any event, the applicants could keep only a limited amount of printed materials in their cells. The second applicant was not allowed to use a magnifying glass and a calculator for some time, which must have slowed down his work. The case file was made available to the defence only in special rooms. The applicants and their lawyers were unable to discuss the case confidentially and, simultaneously, to work with the case file: if they needed to have the case file before them, the presence of an investigator was obligatory. In 2004 the case files were transferred to the remand prison, and, as follows from the applicants’ lawyers’ complaints to the investigative authorities, this made photocopying of documents impossible.

First and foremost, the Court observes that in the present case each applicant was assisted by a team of highly professional lawyers, many of them of great renown. All of them were privately retained and all had spent a considerable amount of time working with the applicants’ cases. The Court reiterates that in Kamasinski v.

However, the present case must be distinguished from Öcalan. In the latter the applicant had no access to the case file whatsoever prior to the start of the trial, whereas in the present case both applicants had the case files at their disposal for several months. When in Öcalan the applicant was finally given direct access to the materials of the prosecution case, he had only twenty days to read 17,000 pages. The time given to the applicants in the present case was much longer. Finally, in Öcalan v. Turkey (no. 46221/99, § 162, 12 March 2003) “the applicant’s lawyers may have been prevented from giving the applicant an assessment of the importance of all these items of evidence by the sheer number and volume of documents and the restriction imposed on the number and length of their visits”.

Importantly, the applicants were not limited in the number and duration of their meetings with the lawyers. The defence lawyers had at their disposal portable copying and scanning devices and were thus able to make and keep copies of the most important documents in the case file. The Court is aware that certain restrictions applied to the meetings between the applicants and their respective defence teams, in particular as regards the exchange of notes and documents. Those restrictions will be analysed separately under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention.

The Court previously held that unrestricted use of any notes and the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents were important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court’s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, §§ 59 and 63, 24 April 2007; Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, §§ 64 and 68, 15 January 2008; and Moiseyev, cited above, § 217).

Their ability to absorb and analyse information was necessarily above average; they knew the business processes at the heart of the case and were, arguably, more competent in those matters than any other participants in the proceedings. Their professional status is also an additional factor in favour of the Court’s finding that the applicants’ inability to study every document personally was somehow compensated by their lawyers’ participation in examination of the case file: it must have been natural for the applicants, as senior managers, to delegate certain tasks to their lawyers."

It follows that the applicants did not need to read every page of such contracts in order to counter the prosecution’s arguments. As transpires from the judgment in the applicants’ case, a large part of the materials in both cases must have been identical.

The applicants further claimed that before finalising their submissions to the court of appeal the defence had to verify the accuracy of the trial record and read materials added in the course of the trial. The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial (see Yukos, cited above, § 538). The Court accepts that studying a trial record and other trial materials may be a necessary phase in the preparation of a brief of appeal, especially where, as in the case at hand, the defence questions the lower courts’ findings of fact and challenges procedural decisions made during the trial, and where the court of appeal does not conduct a full rehearing of the case but bases its conclusions on written materials contained in the case file (see, mutatis mutandis, Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 107, 16 November 2006). The Court will therefore examine whether the defence was given sufficient time to study the trial materials."

The remaining volumes were not available to the defence, apparently because GPO was using them. Those volumes contained a number of the court’s procedural rulings and some documentary evidence added during the trial. The remaining volumes were given to the defence some time later, but the applicants were silent on that point and the Government did not comment either.

The Court is not in a position to say whether this was really so. It is, however, worrying that the defence’s written submissions on the trial record were dismissed by the domestic judge in a summary manner. The judge refused to consider the audiotapes made by the defence throughout the trial (see paragraph 287 above) and held in essence that she trusted her secretaries and her own memory better than the audiotapes (see paragraph 291 above). The Court accepts that audio-recording is not the only possible method of keeping track of proceedings. However, the case at hand was extremely complex, the trial lasted for nearly a year, seven secretaries were employed to keep the summary record, and hearings were held almost every day. In such circumstances it is difficult to believe that in all 126 pages of the defence’s written submissions, based on the audiotapes they had made, there was not a single accurate remark worthy of attention and that the secretaries’ diligence and the judge’s memory were infallible. In addition, the date of the appellate hearing was set by the Chairman of the Meshchanskiy District Court before Judge Kolesnikova had ruled on the defence’s objections to the trial record (see paragraph 290 above). This all leads the Court to the conclusion that the objections to the trial record were not considered seriously, and that the accuracy of the trial record is, therefore, open to doubt."

That “disadvantaged position” need not necessarily be analysed in terms of the equality-of-arms guarantee, primarily because the Court does not know whether the prosecution had any problems with access to and the accuracy of the trial materials. The situation may, however, be assessed alone, in the light of the principle of adversarial proceedings, which means, inter alia, that the defence must have a possibility to put arguments on all pertinent points, including “the elements ... which relate to procedure” (see Dowsett, cited above)."

Austria, cited above, § 50). The defence must be able to put relevant arguments so as to influence the outcome of the proceedings. In the circumstances the Court considers that possible inaccuracies in the trial record and the defence’s temporary inability to obtain access to part of the trial materials did not make it impossible for the defence to formulate their arguments and did not, therefore, influence the outcome of the appeal proceedings. The applicants’ conviction was based on various items of evidence, including a large amount of documentary evidence and statements from dozens of witnesses. Even acknowledging that the trial record may have contained some inaccuracies, the Court is not persuaded that they were such as to render the conviction unsafe. Furthermore, the defence were aware of the procedural decisions that had been taken during the trial and what materials had been added. They had audio recordings of the trial proceedings and could have relied on them in the preparation of their points of appeal."

An exception to this rule concerned letters to certain State bodies and to the European Court itself. All “proposals and requests” of a detainee addressed to his lawyer had first go to the prison administration, which had three days to review them and forward them to the addressee. Those rules were intended to “prevent the entry of prohibited items into the territory of the facilities” and thus corresponded to Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention.

The Government further stressed that pursuant to point 27 of the Remand Prisons Rules (Decree of the Ministry of Justice of 12 May 2000, no. 148) lawyers were prohibited from accepting “letters of private character” from detainees. In the case at hand it was not a private letter which was seized, but a note which contained instructions to commit unlawful actions. That note had contained a plan of actions for the defence. It described how to exert pressure on the investigative authorities and on the administration of the remand prison. In particular, it had mentioned a hunger strike. In addition, the note had contained the following instructions to the first applicant’s lawyers: “to address the issue with witnesses”; “as to the participation in RTT, Lebedev must give a negative answer”, “to address the issue of fees received for the consulting services”, “to obtain evidence [from the defence witnesses] that there was no criminal intent, and that Mr Lebedev did not give any orders on the methods of investment and taxation”. In other words, in that note the first applicant had tried to induce witnesses to perjury, to obtain false evidence, and to collude with the second applicant, and sought to maintain control of over one hundred defence witnesses who had been former employees of Yukos."

Mr Shmidt had not been subjected to a personal search. The seizure of that document had been lawful by virtue of sections 16, 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and of Decree no. 148 – it was a “prohibited object”.

Prison officials were able to see what was happening in the meeting room but not to hear conversations. The Government referred to the record of an interview with the second applicant: according to the record, when the applicant was asked whether he had had an opportunity to consult his lawyers in private, he had replied: “Not always, but, in general, yes”.

The defence lawyers were capable of communicating with their clients orally during the breaks in the court hearings.

The applicants were not separated from the lawyers by a screen during the meetings in the remand prison. As to the exchange of documents in the courtroom, the head escort officer informed the defence that the applicants were entitled to use their notes, show them to the defence and transmit documents. Pursuant to the law the exchange of objects and documents between the defence lawyers and the defendant had to remain under the supervision of the investigators and the court, in order to exclude collusion. Under Article 275 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code the applicants were entitled to use notes, which had to be shown to the presiding judge if he or she so requested. The presiding judge had explained to the defence that all transmitted documents should first be shown to her for inspection, to which Mr Padva, one of the first applicant’s lawyers, replied “Sure, by all means”. The judge needed to inspect notes transmitted from the applicants to their lawyers in order to decide whether they were related to the criminal proceedings, and in order to prevent the applicants giving their lawyers personal letters and similar documents that were not relevant to the case. The judge did not object to the contacts between the applicants and the lawyers during the breaks and even in the course of the hearing (to the extent that these did not pose a problem for the normal course of the hearing), but insisted on inspecting written documents passed between them. That measure was accepted by Mr Padva, who had said: “I will print out [those documents and notes] and show them to you”. The second applicant said to the judge that he did not always need to pass documents to his lawyers but at least needed to read them or let them be read.

In the course of the search, the investigators seized, and later added to the criminal case file as evidence, documents constituting lawyer’s case files for a number of different clients. Those documents were subsequently widely used by the investigators. The files were labelled as containing lawyers’ notes relating to the defence of the second applicant, and Mr Drel’s role in the case was very well known to the GPO and the investigators. It was indisputably established before the Meshchanskiy District Court that a number of documents were seized directly from Mr Drel, a defence lawyer in the criminal case, shortly before the second applicant’s arrest on 25 October 2003; these concerned the first applicant’s tax affairs and advice given to the applicant in connection with the case being conducted at that time against the second applicant, who by that time had already been in detention for more than three months. Since the first applicant’s name was mentioned in the charges against the second applicant – and the charges subsequently brought against them were virtually identical – Mr Drel, at the first applicant’s request, had formulated the applicant’s defence position in the event of identical charges being brought against him.

It was claimed in the report following Ms Artyukhova’s search that the duty officer saw that “the lawyer and the defendant were repeatedly passing to each other notepads with some notes, making notes therein from time to time”.

The defence complained to the Meshchanskiy District Court about the inability to discuss matters confidentially in the court room on a significant number of occasions. The trial court refused to alter the arrangements in any way, simply stating that the defence were able to discuss matters confidentially during the adjournments. The District Court took the view that the requirement that the defence lawyers stood at least one metre from the applicants in the cage “does not really have anything to do with the case”.

As to Ms Khrunova and Ms Mikhailova, they were both authorised by the first applicant to act for him, in relation to the criminal proceedings as well as the applicant’s case before the Court. The Government’s reliance on Articles 62 and 72 of the CCrP was misconceived. Those provisions related to a lawyer’s participation in the trial, and did not govern the right of a lawyer to see his client. Section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act contained the applicable law in relation to access to a lawyer and provided that an accused was permitted to receive visits from his lawyer “with no limitation of their number or duration”. Moreover, Section 18 expressly stated that “visits shall be granted to a defence lawyer upon presentation of a lawyer’s ID and an authorisation. Demanding other documents from a lawyer is prohibited”. There was no requirement under domestic law for the trial court to “validate” a lawyer before he or she was permitted access to a client who had already authorised that lawyer to represent him or her in the proceedings.

Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, § 97, 2 November 2010). An accused’s right to communicate with his advocate out of hearing of a third person is part of the basic requirements of a fair trial. If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, “his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective” (see S. v. Switzerland, 28 November 1991, § 48, Series A no. 220). Any interference with privileged material, and, a fortiori, the use of such material against the accused in the proceedings should be exceptional, be justified by a pressing need and will always be subjected to the strictest scrutiny by this Court (see Khodorkovskiy (no.1), § 198)."

Second, there could be legitimate restrictions related to the security risks posed by the defendant. The existence of any “security risk” may be inferred from the nature of the accusations against him, by the detainee’s criminal profile, his behaviour during the proceedings, etc. Thus, the Court has tolerated certain restrictions imposed on lawyer-client contacts in cases of terrorism and organised crime (cf. e.g. Erdem v. Germany, no. 38321/97, § 65 et seq., ECHR 2001-VII (extracts); and Istratii and others v. Moldova, nos. 8721/05, 8705/05 and 8742/05, §§ 97 et seq., 27 March 2007)."

Germany, 16 December 1992, § 37, Series A no. 251 B). The Court refers in this respect to its findings in Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, §§ 46-48, Series A no. 233) where it held that “it is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion.

At the same time, the Court has repeatedly held that the persecution of members of the legal profession strikes at the very heart of the Convention system (see, for example, Elci and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, § 669, 13 November 2003).

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that Mr Drel was not only a lawyer and a member of the Bar – he was also a legal representative of both applicants in the same criminal case within which the searches were ordered (see paragraphs 44 and 61 above), and the investigators could not have been unaware of that fact. From the search record itself it is clear that the investigators knew that they were entering a law firm’s office and were seizing the working files of a lawyer who represented the applicants (see, in particular, paragraph 71 above). Thus, by searching in Mr Drel’s office and seizing his working files the authorities deliberately interfered with the secrecy of the lawyer-client contacts protected under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see André and Other v. France, no. 18603/03, § 41, 24 July 2008)."

The Government did not explain what sort of information Mr Drel might have had, how important it was for the investigation, and whether it could have been obtained by other means. At the relevant time Mr Drel was not under suspicion of any kind. Most significantly, the search in Mr Drel’s office was not accompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards, for example a court warrant, as required by the Advocacy Act and confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 398 and 399 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan, cited above, § 214; Golovan v. Ukraine, no. 41716/06, § 64, 5 July 2012; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v. Austria, no. 74336/01, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). There were no specific considerations which might have justified the departure from the general rule requiring a court warrant, and this omission strengthens the Court’s conclusion that the search and seizure were arbitrary and thus contrary to the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention.",

The Government claimed that at the time all correspondence by detainees was subject to perusal by the prison administration, and that the prison administration could lawfully seize any document which was not submitted through the prison administration. The Government relied on sections 16, 18, and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, point 27 of the Internal Regulations for Remand Prisons, as well as Articles 19.12, 27.1 and 27.10 of the Code of Administrative Offences (see the “Relevant domestic law” part above, paragraphs 388 et seq.)."

                "637. The Court observes that not only the applicants’ letters to their relatives or friends were subject to perusal; also the notes and drafts prepared by the applicants’ lawyers and brought to the meetings with their clients were regarded by the prison administration as “prohibited objects” (see, in particular, paragraphs 136 and 137 above) and seized. Such limitations, however, had no firm basis in domestic law. Thus, the legislation referred to by the Government regulated the correspondence of detainees with the outside world (“telegrams [and] letters” or “proposals, declarations and complaints” - see section 20 of the Detention on Remand Act, sections 84, 86, 91 and 99 of the Internal Regulations). It also mentioned “objects, substances and foodstuff” which the detainees were not allowed to have or to use (see sections 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and, in particular, section 27 of the Internal Regulations, which associates “objects” with physical objects rather than documents, or Article 19.12 of the Code of Administrative Offences). The Court has doubts as to whether the drafts or notes made by a lawyer during a meeting with his or her client could be qualified as “correspondence” or “prohibited objects” within the meaning of the Detention on Remand Act or the Internal Regulations. The Government did not specify what set of rules applied to the notes and to other written materials which the applicants might have exchanged with their lawyers during the meetings, and the Court cannot accept that the law was applied by extension in such a sensitive area as intereference with privileged materials of the defence. The Court reiterates in this respect that any limitations imposed on a detainee concerning his contacts with lawyers should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K. v. Russia, no. 2512/04, §§ 98-99, 12 February 2009, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "638. Furthermore, even assuming that the Russian law at the time prevented the defence from keeping and exchanging notes during the meetings, the Court is not persuaded that such a measure was necessary in the applicants’ case. Secrecy of written communications is no less important than the secrecy of oral exchanges, especially where the case is factually and legally complex. As follows from the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29 November 2010 (see paragraph 396 above), notes, drafts, outlines, action plans, etc. prepared by the lawyer for or during a meeting with his detained client are to all intents and purposes privileged material. In addition, as noted by the Constitutional Court, certain exceptions from the general principle of confidentiality are permissible, but only if the authorities have a reasonable cause to believe that the professional privilege is being abused. The Court fully subscribes to this position. The Court reiterates that in Campbell, cited above, it stressed that the prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer should not be “susceptible to routine scrutiny”. Such correspondence can be opened only when the prison authorities have “reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure”. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The reading of a prisoner’s mail to and from a lawyer should only be permitted “in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature” (§ 48)."
            ],
            [
                "639. In the present case the authorities took as their starting point the opposite presumption, namely that all written communications between any detained person and his lawyer were suspect. This went so far as to assimilate “correspondence” with written notes made by the lawyers in preparation for the meetings with the client or during them. The only way for the defence to overcome that presumption was to submit their working papers to the prison authorities for inspection, i.e. to reveal their arguments to a body which could hardly be regarded as independent, and which was required by law to communicate all suspicious correspondence to the investigative authorities (see paragraph 392 above)."
            ],
            [
                "640. Again, the principle of confidentiality of lawyer-client contacts is not absolute. However, the fact that a criminal defendant is detained is not sufficient to subject all of his written communications with his lawyers to perusal, and that for an indefinite period of time and without any justification specific for that particular case. The Court has repeatedly condemned the practice of “indiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant’s correspondence” with his lawyer (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005; see also Kepeneklioğlu v. Turkey, no. 73520/01, § 31, 23 January 2007). This is a fortiori true in respect of papers brought by the lawyer to a meeting with his client or prepared during the meeting. To have a reasonable cause for interfering with the confidentiality of lawyer-client written communications the authorities must have something more than a sweeping presumption that lawyers always conspire with their clients in disregard of the rules of professional ethics and despite the serious sanctions which such behaviour entails."

                "641. The Government did not claim that the authorities were aware of what had been discussed in the meeting rooms. There was nothing in the behaviour of the applicants and their lawyers during those meetings to give rise to any reasonable suspicion of abuse of confidentiality; they were not “extraordinarily dangerous [criminals] whose methods had features in common with those of terrorists” (see S. v. Switzerland, cited above, § 47, see also Kröcher and Möller v. Switzerland, no. 8463/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1981, DR 26, p. 40). The applicants were accused of non-violent economic crimes and had no criminal record (compare with Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, § 58, 13 March 2007). There were no ascertainable facts showing that the applicants’ lawyers might abuse their professional privilege. The Court stresses that the measures complained of were not limited to the first days or weeks after the applicants’ arrest, when the risk of tampering with evidence, collision or re-offending was arguably higher, but lasted for over two years. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the rule whereby working documents of the defence, drafts, notes etc. were subject to perusal and could have been confiscated if not checked by the prison authorities beforehand was unjustified. Accordingly, the searches of the applicants’ lawyers were also unjustified.",

                "644. The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the defence agreed to such security arrangements (see paragraph 152 above). However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence’s rights under Article 6 § 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v.

At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the “security plan” implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge’s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her. The defence seemingly had no other choice but to accept that new rule. Therefore, Mr Padva’s remark that he would comply with the new rule cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal and voluntary acceptance of it."

Nevertheless, in the circumstances the new rule still fell short of the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c). The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants’ case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, § 67) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners’ correspondence). In the Court’s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge’s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial."

In the light of the materials of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the applicants’ account in this respect (see, in particular, paragraphs 151 and 154 above). In particular, the Court notes that the lawyers were not allowed to come closer than 50 cm to their clients when they wished to speak to them, and that escort officers were always standing in close proximity.

Thus, for example, in assessing limitations imposed on the defence in the case of Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012), the Court applied a quantitative approach and held as follows (§ 92):",
                "“The security arrangements [i.e. placement of the accused in a metal cage] undeniably limited communication between the applicant and his lawyer during the hearing. These limitations did not, however, amount to a complete lack of communication between the applicant and his lawyer; the applicant did not demonstrate that it was impossible to request that the lawyer’s seat be brought closer to his “cage”, or that they had been denied an opportunity for private communication when necessary.”",
                "In contrast with Titarenko, in the present case the applicants did not have “an opportunity for private communication” with their lawyers, due to the permanent presence of escort officers near the metal cage and the minimal distance the lawyers had to respect. The fact that the defence was able to request adjournments during the hearings is irrelevant: it appears that even during those adjournments the lawyers were unable to discuss the case with their clients anywhere but in the hearing room, i.e. in the close vicinity of the prison guards. The Court concludes that even though the applicants benefited from legal assistance by several lawyers, the secrecy of their exchanges, both oral and written, was seriously impaired during the hearings."

On 20 January 2003 Mr Rivkin (a defence counsel) requested the court to admit in evidence an expert report by Mr Shchekin, who had been previously heard by the court in the capacity of an expert witness ( spetsialist ). At the request of the court, Mr Shchekin enumerated pages of the report which he had prepared personally and those which had not been written by him. Mr Shchekin gave his interpretation of the tax law. On 25 January 2005 Mr Rivkin requested the court to admit in evidence an “expert report” by Mr Semenov. The “expert report” was attached to the materials of the case (without attachments, since they mostly consisted of extracts from the applicable law and decisions of the commercial courts which had not been “properly certified”). Mr Semenov testified about the conditions in which he had prepared his written report. The court, having examined their evidence, concluded in the judgment that those two persons could not be considered as “expert witnesses”, since they did not have the necessary specialist knowledge. Thus, they had never worked in any State tax authority or in an audit firm, with the exception of Mr Shchekin, who had worked as a lawyer for four months in 1996 in a State tax service. Those two persons were in fact lawyers and/or law professors. However, the court did not require their commentaries and interpretations of the law. In addition, Mr Shchekin had been advising Yukos in the proceedings before the commercial courts and therefore had a conflict of interest."

Accordingly, when the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors were required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 119 and 147)."

The Government argued that Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kuprianov were not “witnesses” within the meaning of Article 6 § 3 (d), but “experts”, i.e. persons with specialist knowledge who assisted the court in a particular technical or scientific filed. The Court agrees that the role of an expert witness in the proceedings can be distinguished from that of an eye-witness who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. That does not mean, however, that testing of expert evidence is not covered by Article 6 § 3 (d) taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 1. There is an extensive case-law of the Court which guarantees to the defence a right to study and challenge not only an expert report as such but also the credibility of those who have prepared it, through their direct questioning (see, amongst other authorities, Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, § 42, Series A no. 211; Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, §§ 81 ‑ 82, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II; and Mirilashvili v.

The Court cannot accept this argument. Both Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov were hired as experts by the prosecution at the investigation stage and conducted their expert examination at the premises of the GPO, without any involvement of the defence (compare with Zarb v.

Consequently, their position was closer to that of a “prosecution witness”. Contrary to the situation with defence witnesses, the accused is not required to demonstrate the importance of a prosecution witness. If the prosecution decides that a particular person is a relevant source of information and relies on his or her testimony at the trial (see paragraph 165 above), and if the testimony of that witness is used by the court to support a guilty verdict (which was the case – see paragraph 271 above), it must be presumed that his or her personal appearance and questioning are necessary, unless the testimony of that witness is manifestly irrelevant or redundant."

There is nothing in the judgment of the District Court to counter that assumption. The defence explained to the District Court why they had doubts about the reliability of the expert reports and the methods employed by the experts (see paragraph 169 above).

If the court needed any further information about the names or qualifications of experts involved in the preparation of the reports, it was easy to obtain it.

That fact gave rise to a separate finding of a violation under Article 6 § 3 (d) (see paragraph 716 above) and it undoubtedly made the defence’s task of proving the usefulness of the counter-reports more difficult."

A similar finding in respect of the first applicant was made in the Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) case, §§ 123 et seq. In the Court’s opinion, by holding that such “harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial” (see paragraph 484 above, with further references) the Court has already addressed the essence of the applicants’ complaint under Article 6 § 2. Other aspects of the “metal cage issue”, namely the question whether such security arrangements encroached on the applicants’ rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) and (c) have already been addressed separately above, in Section VI."

Russian criminal law was sufficiently clear on the matter; the relevant legislation had been published in the official mass media and was thus available to the applicants or their legal consultants. The Government stressed that the applicants, as businessmen, could have solicited the opinion of the most experienced lawyers. In addition, the first applicant held two university degrees. It was hard to believe that the applicants had never assessed the risks related to their business activities in Russia, including the risks in the sphere of criminal law. The complexity of the tax-avoidance scheme suggested that it had been designed after a careful analysis of the applicable legislation in order to preserve unlawfully obtained money."

Tax evasion, a crime proscribed by Articles 198 and 199 of the Code, was a deliberate act, aimed at the default in payment of taxes and dues in large or very large amounts which led to the partial or complete non-receipt of those taxes and dues by the treasury. There could be different methods of tax evasion. For example, it could occur in the form of a deliberate and knowing indication of false information in the tax declaration or in other documents which the taxpayer must submit to the tax authority in accordance with the law. “Other documents” in this context meant any documents necessary for the calculation of the taxes due. “Deliberate” meant the existence of a direct intent to give false information. “False information” was understood as any incorrect data about the object of the tax (i.e. property, revenue or other operations and status), about the right to tax deductions, credits etc., which could affect the correctness of the calculation of the amount due by the taxpayer. “Indication of the false information” could take the form of the taxpayer’s failure to indicate the true amount of his revenues; artificial minimisation of revenues or increase of deductible costs; falsification of data on the time period when certain revenues were received or losses suffered; distortion of physical characteristics of a particular type of business activity, etc."

The Government further referred to the opinion of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which noted that tax-evasion schemes were quite widespread and were constantly developing, becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, which called for the enactment of new laws penalising particular types of conduct. Their report on money laundering in 1999-98 mentioned the use of offshore companies as a common tax-evasion technique. The Financial Action Task Force continued to discover new forms of tax evasion every year; however, this could not preclude the States from bringing the persons responsible for tax evasion to criminal liability.

The central question was therefore whether such schemes had been discovered and penalised in any other case before the applicants were brought to trial. The Government asserted that the tax-evasion schemes used by the applicants were “relatively new” and were discovered only in the course of the investigation into the applicants’ case. Thus, the sham companies were registered and functioned on the territories enjoying a special taxation regime. However, the ZATO Act clearly established criteria which permitted companies incorporated and registered in those locations to use that special regime. In order to benefit from tax cuts the companies had to have up to 90 per cent of their fixed assets and 70 per cent of their human resources concentrated in those territories. Seventy per cent of the wage-fund was supposed to be paid to locally-hired employees. The companies which were buying oil from Yukos did not correspond to those requirements; consequently, they obtained tax cuts unlawfully and caused damage to the State. The provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation which applied to the applicants’ case were clear and did not change. What changed (or, rather, what had been amplified) was the practice of their application."

The actual word used in relation to Business Oil and other trading companies in the criminal judgment was “ podstavnye ” (“sham [legal entities]”).

It follows that the offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied when the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it or by way of appropriate legal advice, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Liivik v.

Foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law concerned, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed.

The Court also reiterates that “the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice” (see Scoppola (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 100).

The Court’s case-law suggest that its supervisory function consists in considering whether the national court, in reaching its decision, has not unreasonably interpreted, and applied to the applicant, the law concerned. In other words, the Court applies a relaxed standard in such matters, which allows the States to develop their case-law and adjust it to the changing conditions of modern society (see Eurofinacom v.

The Court did not find a violation of Article 7 in this case referring to the fact that the old distinction between “lawful” and “unlawful” involuntary sexual intercourse was clearly obsolete, that the new interpretation continued “a perceptible line of case-law development” and that “the essentially debasing character of rape” was so manifest that the judicial recognition of such behaviour as criminal was not “at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 of the Convention” (see §§ 42-44)."

Both domestic law and jurisprudence were silent on this point”.

                "786. The Court reiterates that in the Yukos case it did not address the company’s complaint under Article 7 of the Convention (see § 667). However, it examined whether the bringing of the company to tax liability for evading company taxes was “based on a reasonable and foreseeable interpretation of the domestic law” (see the title above § 576 of the Yukos judgment). That allegation was examined under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The Court considers that its findings under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the Yukos case cannot be automatically applied to the applicants’ complaint under Article 7 in the present case. However, there are many similarities between the applicants’ position under Article 7 and the company’s arguments under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the Yukos case. Consequently, the Court’s findings in Yukos are of relevance. The Court will recall the most important elements of its findings concerning the lawfulness of tax reassessment insofar as it applied to the company:",
                "“588. ... The company claimed that ... it used lawful “tax optimisation techniques” which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts .... It also complained that any existing legal basis for finding the company liable fell short of the Convention requirements in respect of the quality of the law and that, in any event, the application of the relevant laws contradicted established practice. Accordingly, the Court has to determine whether the relevant tax arrangements were domestically lawful at the time ... and whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable. ...",
                "591. ... The company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts ...",
                "592. The domestic courts found that [the tax minimisation technique applied by the company] was ... unlawful ..., as it involved the fraudulent registration of trading entities by the applicant company in the name of third persons and its corresponding failure to declare to the tax authorities its true relation to these companies .... The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety ...",
                "593. The arrangement was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices ..., and by its nature involved certain operations ... which were incompatible with the rules governing the relations between independent legal entities ... The Court ... is not persuaded by the applicant company’s reference to case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 ... and its reliance on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code ...",
                "594. By contrast to the Tax Assessments in issue, the respondent entity in case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 was not alleged to have been part of a larger tax fraud and [the Tax Service] failed to prove that it had been sham. The courts established that the entity had some assets, employees and a bank account at the place of its registration and dismissed the claims [by the Tax Service]. ... The Court cannot agree with the applicant company’s allegation that its particular way of “optimising tax” had been previously examined by the domestic courts and upheld as valid ... The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the findings of the domestic courts that applicant company’s tax arrangements were unlawful at the time when the company had used them, were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable.",
                "595. The Court will now turn to the question whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable. ... The [domestic] courts established that the trading companies had been sham and had been entirely controlled by the applicant company and accordingly reclassified the transactions conducted by the sham entities as transactions conducted in reality by the applicant company.",
                "596. The courts ... changed the characterisation of the sales operations of the sham entities. They decided that these were in reality conducted by the applicant company and that it had been incumbent on the latter to fulfil the corresponding obligation to pay various taxes on these activities. Finally, the courts noted that the setting up and running of the sham arrangement by the applicant company resulted in ... the intentional non-payment of various taxes ...",
                "597. Having regard to the applicable domestic law, the Court finds that ... under the then rules contractual arrangements made by the parties in commercial transactions were only valid in so far as the parties were acting in good faith and that the tax authorities had broad powers in verifying the character of the parties’ conduct and contesting the legal characterisation of such arrangements before the courts. This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time .... The case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 .... Moreover, in a number of its rulings ... the Constitutional Court [mentioned] possible consequences of a taxpayer’s bad faith conduct.",
                "598. In so far as the applicant company complained that the bad faith doctrine had been too vague, the Court would again reiterate that ... many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice ... On the facts, ... the applicable legal norms made it quite clear that, if uncovered, a taxpayer faced the risk of tax reassessment of its actual economic activity in the light of the relevant findings of the competent authorities. And this is precisely what happened to the applicant company in the case at hand.",
                "599. Overall, having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in this sphere and the fact that the applicant company was a large business holding which at the relevant time could have been expected to have recourse to professional auditors and consultants ..., the Court finds that there existed a sufficiently clear legal basis for finding the applicant company liable in the Tax Assessments 2000-2003.”",

                "787. One of the applicants’ complaints under Article 7 concerned their conviction for the payment of taxes with promissory notes. The Court observes in this respect that the Meshchanskiy District Court convicted the applicants for two distinct counts of tax evasion under Article 199. The first count related to the allegedly unlawful tax cuts obtained by the trading companies. The second related to the payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraphs 111 et seq. above). The court of appeal (the Moscow City Court) quashed the District Court’s judgment in so far as it concerned payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraph 318 above). It found that after the 2003 amendments to Article 199, such behaviour ceased to be a crime, since the law no longer referred to “other methods” of tax evasion. That second count was therefore removed from the list of accusations against the applicants, as upheld at final instance. In such circumstances the Court concludes that the applicants could not claim to be victims of the alleged violation of Article 7 in this respect, since they had not been “held guilty” of a crime within the meaning of that Convention provision.",

                "788. The applicants claimed that, as the law stood in 1999-2000, there were certain procedural obstacles to bringing them to criminal liability for tax evasion. In particular, the applicants referred to the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of 27 May 2003 (see paragraph 43 above) which may be interpreted as requiring that bringing a person to criminal liability for tax evasion must be preceded by establishing his tax liability in separate proceedings. The case of Chelpiks decided by the commercial courts of the Urals District implied that it was impossible to sue a taxpayer for the use of tax advantages granted by a preferential tax agreement without previously invalidating that agreement (see paragraph 436 above). However, the applicants in the present case had been brought to criminal liability without the preferential tax agreements being invalidated and before the courts pronounced on the tax liability of the company in separate proceedings."

                "789. The Court is not persuaded that the applicants’ understanding of the Constitutional Court’s ruling is correct. Similarly, the Urals District commercial court’s decision in the Chelpiks case may reasonably have a different interpretation. Be that as it may, the Court reiterates that Article 7 guarantees that criminal offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by substantive criminal law. It does not, however, set any requirements as to the procedure in which those offences must be investigated and brought to trial. The Court reiterates that in the case of Coëme and Others v. Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 149, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) it faced a somewhat similar claim by the applicants, who argued that Article 7 guaranteed not only the foreseeability of the punishment, but also the foreseeability of the prosecution. In that case the new law had extended the limitation period and thus prolonged the period of time during which prosecutions could be brought in respect of the offences imputed to the applicants. The Court admitted that the application of the new law “detrimentally affected the applicants’ situation, in particular by frustrating their expectations”, but that it did not “entail an infringement of the rights guaranteed by Article 7, since that provision cannot be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation”."

                "790. A similar reasoning is applicable in the case at hand. The applicants may have expected that the authorities would be unable to prosecute them in a criminal court without going first through separate court proceedings, tax or civil. The Court reiterates that it is not persuaded that this was the only possible scenario for their prosecution. In any event, the alleged “procedural obstacles” did not mean that the acts imputed to the applicants were not defined as “criminal offences” at the moment when they were committed. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 on this account.",

The Court will now turn to the applicants’ conviction under Article 198 and 199 for the use of various tax-minimisation techniques in respect of both company taxes and personal income taxes. The Court observes that “tax evasion” is defined in Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code in very general terms (see paragraph 429 above). The Code describes tax evasion as “knowing” inclusion of “false data” in the fiscal declarations. By itself such a broad definition does not raise any issue under Article 7 of the Convention. Forms of economic activity are in constant development, and so are the methods of tax evasion. In order to define whether a particular behaviour amounts to “tax evasion” in the criminal-law sense the domestic courts may invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law. The law in this area may be sufficiently flexible to adapt to new situations, without, however, becoming unpredictable."

                "792. The applicants argued that the declarations of the trading companies did not include any “false” information. The applicants had every reason to believe that those declarations faithfully reflected all the transactions of the trading companies and were thus accurate for the purposes of the ZATO Act. Similarly, the applicants duly reported on the amounts they had been receiving from the Isle of Man companies, in accordance with the Small Business Act. Both acts were formulated very precisely and did not use such concepts as “business purpose”, “sham” or “bad faith”. The Government argued that the then existing case-law developed the concept of “tax evasion” in sufficient detail to make the applicants’ conviction foreseeable."

It observes that the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 8 of 4 July 1997, referred to by the Government (see paragraph 753 above), explained some of the concepts related to the concept of “tax evasion” and of the constituent elements thereof. However, it did not describe such phenomena as “transfer pricing”, “sham” companies or transactions, which were at the heart of the applicants’ criminal case. The use of “frontman” companies as a method of tax evasion was first mentioned explicitly in the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 64 of 28 December 2006 (see paragraph 434 above). That Ruling cannot support the Government’s case, because the acts imputed to the applicants related to 1998-2000."

Other case-law referred to by the Government is, for the most part, irrelevant, since it concerned other forms of tax evasion, such as, for example, the straightforward failure to declare revenues. There were few cases which concerned the use of “front” or “sham” companies, but they were decided in 2002 or even later (see, in particular, the cases of Mironov and Selivanov summarised in paragraph 754 above). The Court is not aware of any other case-law on the matter contemporary to the relevant period of time. Writings of legal scholars referred to by the Government were scarce and inconclusive. The Court concludes that in the criminal law sphere there was no case-law directly applicable to the transfer pricing arrangements and allegedly sham transactions as those in the heart of the applicants’ case."

The Government’s next argument was that the illegal character of such arrangements might have been established with reference to general principles derived from other areas of law, in particular the tax and civil law. This argument is not devoid of merit. The Court observes that the position of the authorities in the tax proceedings against Yukos was centred on the concept of “sham transaction”. The prosecution in the applicants’ case alleged that the applicants were submitting “false” information to the authorities. For many purposes “sham” is a synonym of “false”, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a “sham” transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as “knowingly” submitting “false information” to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code."

A similar (albeit not identical) legal construction existed in the Tax Code: for example, in certain situations the Code allowed tax authorities to disregard a contract and calculate taxes due by the parties to it on the basis of imputed “market prices” (see paragraph 414 above). Thus, the “substance-over-form” approach also existed in the field of the tax law.

OOO Pribrezhnoe (see paragraph 439 above), analysed in §§ 593-594 of the Yukos judgment. In that case a commercial court refused to recalculate taxes due by a company registered in the low-tax zone despite several factual elements indicative of the “sham” character of the operations of that company. Factual elements relied on by the Tax Service in the Pribrezhnoye case were very close to those relied on by the prosecution in the criminal case against the applicants.

However, in the Court’s opinion, those cases were mostly decided on the facts. They cannot be construed as negating the power of the courts to invalidate a particular transaction as “sham”. Rather, the courts in those cases found that evidence produced by the Tax Service was insufficient to reach such a conclusion. The fact that in one or two cases the Tax Service failed to produce sufficient evidence and prove the fictitious character of a taxpayer’s operations does not mean that it would fail in all subsequent cases in respect of other taxpayers."

It was not claimed by the applicants, neither in the domestic proceedings nor before this Court, that the trading companies were registered in Lesnoy in order to facilitate logistics, save on production costs, hire qualified staff, etc. As the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 593), “the arrangement [i.e. the tax minimisation scheme] was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices”."

Second, the Court observes that despite the formal domiciliation of the trading companies in Lesnoy, all business activities which generated profit were in fact carried out in Moscow. The trading companies presented themselves as real companies having assets and personnel in the low-tax zone; however, as was established in the domestic proceedings and later confirmed by the Court in the Yukos case (see § 591), all of the trading companies had virtually no assets or personnel in the ZATO, and had enjoyed no operational independence whatsoever from the Moscow headquarters. Thus, the trading companies claimed tax cuts as if they were really operating in the low-tax zone, but in reality they were merely registered there for form’s sake, and all the operations were conducted in Moscow."

Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received “gifts” from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of “market prices” in the relations between affiliated companies."

In the present case, whereas a part of the tax-minimisation scheme was visible to the authorities, the applicants misrepresented or concealed some important aspects of that scheme which arguably might have been crucial for defining eligibility of the trading companies to tax cuts."

The applicants also challenged the finding of the domestic courts to the effect that they (the applicants) had played a leading role in mounting and managing the impugned tax-optimisation scheme. In the opinion of the Court it is difficult to imagine that the applicants, as senior executives and co-owners of Yukos, were not aware of the entire transfer pricing arrangement and did not know that the information included in the fiscal reporting of the trading companies did not reflect the true nature of their operations (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros, cited above, § 59).

Similarly, it is impossible to set an exhaustive list of criteria for defining a particular operation or a company as “sham”. However, the cumulative effect of the elements discussed was sufficient to demonstrate that the operations of the trading companies were likely to be “sham”, that the reporting based thereon did not reflect the realities of the business operations, and that the applicants therefore “knowingly” submitted “false data” in order to reduce the overall tax burden of the company.

Again, this is a question of fact which was disputed in the domestic proceedings. If the “consultancy agreements” between the applicants and the Isle of Man companies were indeed “sham” or “fictitious” – and that was the finding of the domestic courts – one can reasonably consider that the applicants had knowingly submitted false data in their declarations, thus committing an offence under Article 198 of the Criminal Code."

The domestic courts, after having examined the evidence before them, concluded that the fees received by the applicants under the service agreements were de facto payment for the applicants’ work in Yukos and in the affiliated structures – payment which would normally be taxable under the general taxation regime. The applicants’ own explanations concerning their relations with the unnamed “end-users” were quite vague. Even though the applicants were allowed to remain silent, the overall picture of their relations with the two Isle of Man companies and/or “end-users” required some explanation, especially in the light of their parallel work as senior executives of Yukos, work for which they received only a symbolic compensation, and in view of other evidence discovered by the prosecution which showed the links between the applicants and the two Isle of Man companies. The provenance of the money paid by the Isle of Man companies under the “service agreements” – an element which the applicant considered as important – in the eyes of the domestic courts was not important for establishing the true purpose of those transfers, and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with this. In such circumstances the inferences made by the Russian courts as to the real nature of the payments received by the applicants from the two Isle of Man companies were not unreasonable or arbitrary."

Equally, the Court is unable to accept the applicants’ alternative argument, namely that by opting for a licence the applicants simply used a legitimate tax-minimisation technique falling short of tax evasion. The right to choose a particular mode of operation with a view to minimising taxes does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation to submit true information to the tax authorities. In the domestic proceedings (as well as before this Court) the applicants claimed that they had provided consulting services to various clients, including those not related to Yukos. Apparently, their tax declarations were formulated in similar terms. However, the Russian courts did not accept that assertion, holding that the sums received by the applicants had nothing to do with any consulting services but solely related to their work as senior executives in Yukos. In other words, the applicants did not inform the tax authorities of the true nature of their activities. This was clearly not an unintended or minor omission, or a simple misinterpretation of the tax law. In this respect the applicants’ situation was different from that of the defendant in the Vliran case they referred to (see paragraph 443 above)."

It is possible that the authorities simply did not have sufficient information or resources to prosecute the applicants and/or other businessmen for using such schemes. The Court does not exclude that similar “tax-optimisation techniques” might have been known to the tax authorities, for example from the FATF documents (see paragraph 750 above). It is also conceivable that a global analysis of money-flow and sales of Yukos oil might be suggestive of the use of some tax-minimisation techniques. However, there is no evidence that the tax authorities knew exactly what Yukos was doing; as the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 592):",

Thus, the Government insisted that the measure complained of was lawful. Under Article 73 of the CES a convict was entitled to serve his prison sentence in the same federal constituency where he was convicted (in the applicants’ case, Moscow). However, where this is impossible, the convict was sent to serve his sentence in a penal colony situated in the next closest federal constituency. Several regions of Russia (Moscow, St Petersburg and some republics of the Northern Caucasus) have no general-regime penal colonies. In order to avoid prison overcrowding and comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in the Court’s case-law in respect to prison conditions in Russia, convicts from those regions were sent to colonies situated in other regions. For example, convicts from Moscow often served their sentences even further from Moscow than the town of Krasnokamensk, where the first applicant had been sent. According to the Government, Article 73 of the CES “was complied with in the majority of the federal constituencies of the Russian Federation”. In many regions new penal colonies were being built. The applicants were treated in this respect in the same manner as any other convict in a similar situation. There were no grounds for giving the applicants preferential treatment because of their family or financial situation. They were sent to serve their sentences in such distant locations because there was no place for them in other regions of Russia."

Furthermore, the Government noted that the applicants’ cellmates could have learned that they had money in foreign banks. That could have put the applicants in danger. In the Government’s words, the detainees in the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Autonomous region and in the Chita region were less informed about the details of the applicants’ case than those in Central Russia.

As a direct consequence of his transfer to Krasnokamensk, his family had only been able to make use of the “short” visits on one occasion since 2005. Of course, had the applicant been serving his sentence closer to his family, he would have been able to make far greater use of the facility for short visits. On account of the exhausting and demanding nature of the journey, his young twin sons were unable to visit him in Krasnokamensk at all. The children were able to visit the first applicant whilst he was detained in Moscow. The first applicant’s elderly father had been able to visit him only once. The fact that the first applicant’s family did not use up his full allowance of visits – he had five long visits and only one short visit over 14 months at IK-10 penal colony – clearly suggested that the enormous distance prevented visits taking place."

The Government provided no evidence in support of their assertion that overcrowding in Moscow prisons was such that the applicants could not be sent to a penal colony in the Moscow region. Further, the Government did not challenge the first applicant’s assertion that in September 2005 there had been 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation out of a total capacity of 786,753 places.

Second, the Government did not explain why the risk allegedly posed by the other inmates would be lower in Krasnokamensk or Kharp than in Moscow. In fact, for more than two years the applicants had been held in remand prisons in the city of Moscow, and there had not been a single incident involving them during that time concerning relations with their cellmates.

First, the domestic courts wrongly accepted the arguments of the representatives of the FSIN that that there was no requirement upon them to consider the individual circumstances of the convict. Such a contention was clearly incompatible with Article 8. Second, the domestic courts were similarly wrong in failing to require an explanation as to why it was that the applicants was sent to Krasnokamensk and Kharp, thousands of kilometres from Moscow, despite the fact that there were 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation as at September 2005.

The Court reiterates in this respect that any detention which is lawful for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention (and there is no doubt that the applicants’ detention following their conviction complied with Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention) entails by its nature various limitations on private and family life (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 98, Series A, no. 161). It would be fundamentally wrong to analyse each and every case of detention following conviction from the standpoint of Article 8, and to consider the “lawfulness” and “proportionality” of the prison sentence as such."

However, the Convention cannot stop at the prison gate (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 70, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX), and there is no question that a prisoner forfeits all of his Article 8 rights merely because of his status as a person detained following conviction (see Ploski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, 12 November 2002). The Court will not turn a blind eye to such limitations which go beyond what would normally be accepted in the case of an ordinary detainee. Thus, for example, it is an essential part of a prisoner’s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000-X). Limitations on contacts with other prisoners and with family members, imposed by prison rules, have been regarded by the Court as an “interference” with the rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 69, ECHR 2003-II)."

Thus, placing a convict in a particular prison may potentially raise an issue under Article 8 if its effects for the applicant’s private and family life go beyond “normal” hardships and restrictions inherent to the very concept of imprisonment. As the Commission already observed in Wakefield v. the United Kingdom (no. 15817/89, decision of 1 October 1990, DR 66, p. 251): “Article 8 requires the State to assist prisoners as far as possible to create and sustain ties with people outside prison in order to promote prisoners’ social rehabilitation. In this context the location of the place where a prisoner is detained is relevant”. Furthermore, the right to respect for family life imposes upon states a positive obligation to assist prisoners in maintaining effective contact with their close family members (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8 October 1982, DR 30, p. 115). In the context of imprisonment the Commission recognised that the possibility for close family members to visit a detainee constitutes an essential factor in the maintenance of family life (see Hacisuleymanoglou v. Italy no. 23241/94, decision of 20 October 1994, DR no. 79-B, p. 121)."

In the present case the distances involved were much longer than those in Wakefield. Given the geographical situation of the colonies concerned, and the realities of the Russian transport system the Court has no difficulty in accepting that a trip from Moscow to the Krasnokamensk colony or the Kharp colony was a long and exhaustive endeavour, especially for the applicants’ young children. Indeed, it was not the applicants themselves but the members of their respective families who suffered from the remoteness of the colonies.

Those aims (guaranteeing safety of the convict and avoiding general overcrowding) are, in the opinion of the Court, “legitimate” under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention since they contribute to preventing “disorder and crime” and securing the “rights and freedoms” of others.

Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the general assumption that inmates in the Kharp or Krasnokamensk colonies were less dangerous for the applicants since these other inmates did not know who the applicants were: the applicants’ trial was the most mediatised trial of the recent decade and the first applicant’s wealth was well-known from many sources open to the general public. Finally, the Government’s assertion that unnamed “victims” of the applicants’ crimes would try to take vengeance on them did not have any factual basis - the principal victim of the crimes imputed to the applicants was the State itself.

The Court is prepared to accept that given the size of the population in Moscow and the corresponding number of convicts from that city there were no free places for the applicants there. However, the rule set by Article 73 of the Code of Execution of Sentences was relatively clear and simple. It allowed sending a convict to the next closest region, not several thousand kilometres away."

The Court accepts that it was difficult to decide individually for every detainee from Moscow or another region affected by prison overcrowding where he or she must serve the sentence. It appears that in order to address that problem the FSIN came up with a general plan establishing quotas for the distribution of convicts amongst penitentiary colonies in different Russian regions (“federal constituencies”). The Government submitted to the Court a copy of that plan. However, the Government did not explain how that plan was prepared, and did not describe a method or algorithm of distribution of convicts used by the FSIN to draw that plan. The plan itself does not contain any information to that effect. It is consequently difficult to say to what extent the plan was compatible with the “geographical rule” set out in Article 73 of the CES."

On the facts of the present case it is hardly conceivable that there were no free places in any of the many colonies situated closer to Moscow, and that the only two colonies which had free space were located several thousand kilometres away from the applicants’ home. Data referred to by the applicants and not contested by the Government suggested that at the time when the applicants were sent to Siberia and the Far North there were free places in the Russian penitentiary system, including in colonies situated in Central Russia (see paragraphs 328 and 347 above). Over thirty-five regions in Russia are closer to Moscow than the Yamalo-Nenetskiy region, and over fifty-five regions are closer than the Chita region. Therefore, it was likely that the FSIN plan did not adhere strictly to the “geographical rule” fixed in Article 73. This may not have led to a breach of the “geographical rule” in all cases, but it is very likely that that rule was not followed in the applicants’ case."

The Court is also mindful of the situation in Russia, where, historically, penal colonies were built in remote and deserted areas, far away from the densely populated regions of Central Russia. There are other arguments speaking in favour of giving the authorities a large margin of appreciation in this sphere. However, that margin of appreciation is not unlimited. The distribution of the prison population must not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies, such as FSIN. The interests of the convicts in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account. The Russian law is based on a similar assumption, as the spirit and the goal of Article 73 of the CES was to preserve the applicants’ social and family ties to the place where they used to live before the conviction. However, practical implementation of that law in Russia could lead to a disproportionate result, as the applicants’ case demonstrates. In absence of a clear and foreseeable method of distribution of convicts amongst penal colonies, the system failed to “provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities” (see Telegraaf Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, § 90, 22 November 2012).

Italy [GC] (no. 44759/98, ECHR 2001-VII), the Government submitted that “tax matters still form part of the hard core of public-authority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant” (§ 29)."

The unlawful origin of that money was duly established by the judgment of the Meshchanskiy District Court of 16 May 2005. The Government acknowledged that the term “possessions” used in this Convention provision had an autonomous meaning.

He committed those crimes as a member of an organised group. His criminal activities were premeditated, carefully planned and lasted several years. In such circumstances the amounts recovered from him must be regarded as compensation due to society and the State for the wrongs committed by him. The first applicant was therefore deprived of his possessions in the public interest, which prevails in this context over his private interest.

Article 110 of the Tax Code provides that the mens rea of the corporate taxpayer is defined with reference to the mens rea of the managers who acted on its behalf. As a general rule, tax claims concerning unpaid corporate taxes are brought against the corporate taxpayer. However, there are a few exceptions from this rule. Thus, if at the moment when the claim is introduced, the corporate entity still exists but it does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the claim, this triggers the subsidiary liability of the person who was responsible for the tax debt. The same rule applies where the legal entity was liquidated or changed owners at the moment when tax claims were introduced."

It would be inefficient to recover taxes from those sham companies which the first applicant had created, since they were unable to compensate damage caused to the treasury. Russian law did not provide for criminal liability of legal persons. Consequently, in the present case the underlying general rule was that the damage should be compensated by the tortfeasor. The sham companies which participated in the tax evasion scheme have been closed or reorganised in order to conceal the crimes.

On the contrary, it was the settled case-law of the Court that the collection of taxes involves an interference with the rights protected under Article 1 of Protocol 1.

                "861. As to the first of those questions, the first applicant alleged that claims for damages in relation to company tax evasion should be brought against the companies that are alleged to have evaded the taxes and thus the Meshchanskiy District Court was not entitled to make any award of damages against him under this charge. Thus in the I. and K. case the Russian Supreme Court stated that there was no legal justification for upholding a civil claim filed by the tax authorities for the evasion of taxes that were not paid by a joint-stock company implicated in a criminal case to the private individuals convicted in the relevant case. The principles set out in I. and K. were applied by the Moscow Regional Court on 9 October 2002 in its report “On the results of an examination of criminal cases in the economic sphere by the Moscow region courts during 2000 and the first half of 2002”:",

In a criminal case an individual may be recognised as a civil respondent only on the basis of the tax, which he failed to pay into the budget as a taxpayer paying income tax. But as a company’s head or chief accountant, an individual cannot incur tax liability for the company, because the latter, being a separate object of taxation, has its own collection of rights and responsibilities as a taxpayer, particularly as the payer of tax on legal entities or companies, including tax on profit (income), VAT, transactions with securities, tax on profit from stock exchange and insurance operations. Therefore, in this example the company/taxpayer itself must be regarded as the civil respondent in respect of the unpaid taxes and duties. In granting the civil claim submitted by the prosecutor, the court actually shifted the obligation to pay tax arrears to the wrong taxpayer. Granting a civil claim for the collection of tax in a criminal case instigated on the indications specified under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (company tax evasion), from the personal funds of a private individual convicted under this article, has no basis in law”."

However, the Government’s assertions were not supported by reference to any subsequent case-law demonstrating that the case had been challenged, let alone overruled. The Government’s references to the changes in the Criminal Procedure Code introduced in 2002 were equally unsubstantiated: there was no analysis of how the new Code undermined the judgment of the Supreme Court in I. and K. in any way.

In the applicant’s view, the civil damages award was manifestly arbitrary as: (a) the alleged tax arrears had already been collected from Yukos; (b) the promissory notes had all been redeemed in full and there was therefore no loss to the state. Subsequent domestic decisions in related cases had concluded that the promissory notes were redeemed in full: see the judgments of the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Ivannikov case and the judgment of the Miass City Court of Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Lubenets case."

The amounts recovered from him by virtue of the judgment of 16 May 2005 were the same as the amounts recovered from the companies affiliated with the first applicant - in particular, Yukos. The Meshchanskiy District Court ordered the first applicant to pay the Federal Tax Service RUB 17,395,449,282 in relation to the latter’s claim for damages arising from the alleged non-payment of taxes by the ZATO trading companies. The total award for damages related to the crime committed under Article 199 of the Criminal Code comprised: (a) damages related to the tax evasion for 1999 in the amount of RUB 5,447,501,388; and (b) damages relating to the alleged tax evasion for 2000 in the amount of RUB 11,947,947,894. On appeal, the Moscow City Court excluded from the total amount of unpaid taxes for 1999 and 2000 the amount of taxes which were paid by the four trading companies in promissory notes. The basis of the Moscow City Court’s decision on this point was that even if one assumed that payment of tax by the Lesnoy companies by using promissory notes had been unlawful in 1999 and 2000, by the time that the first applicant’s case came to trial the wording of Article 199 of the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of his being convicted under that (or any other) provision of the Criminal Code in respect of such conduct, and the applicant was therefore entitled to invoke the benefit of that change. As a result, the total amount of unpaid taxes was reduced by the Moscow City Court to RUB 1,217,622,799 for 1999 and to RUB 1,566,046,683 for 2000.

Further, according to the Court’s well-established case-law, an instance of interference, including one resulting from a measure to secure payment of taxes, must strike a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. The States, when framing and implementing policies in the area of taxation, enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, since decisions in this area will commonly involve the appreciation of political, economic and social questions which the Convention leaves within the competence of the States parties. The second paragraph of Article 1 explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to enact such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes. In the case of Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands (23 February 1995, § 59, Series A no. 306 ‑ B), the Court stated that “the importance which the drafters of the Convention attached to this aspect of the second paragraph of Article 1 may be gauged from the fact that at a stage when the proposed text did not contain such explicit reference to taxes, it was already understood to reserve the States’ power to pass whatever fiscal laws they considered desirable, provided always that measures in this field did not amount to arbitrary confiscation (see Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Rapporteur of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, Second Session of the Consultative Assembly, Sixteenth Sitting (25 August 1950), Collected Edition of the Travaux préparatoires, vol. VI, p. 140, commenting on the text of the proposed Article 10A, ibid., p. 68)”.

The Court considers, however, that the Government’s reading of Ferrazzini is misconceived. The question for the Court in the present case is not to define whether the “tax proceedings” are “civil proceedings” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, but to define whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to the court order recovering a certain amount of unpaid taxes from a taxpayer. Even if tax proceedings are not civil (cf. Yukos judgment, §§ 527 and 528), a pecuniary award made against a taxpayer within such proceedings may still constitute an “interference” with his possessions. As the Court held in Burden, cited above, “taxation is in principle an interference with the right guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since it deprives the person concerned of a possession, namely the amount of money which must be paid” (§ 59).

However, the Court does not consider that Article 56 was applicable in casu. First, it is questionnable whether the Meshchanskiy District Court had the power to grant the claims of the Tax Service against the applicant while the corporate taxpayer still existed (see paragraph 350 above; see also paragraph 18 above). Second, Article 56 of the Civil Code provides for subsidiary liability of managers of the insolvent company, whereas the judgment of the Meshchanskiy District Court seemed to order the recovery of the outstanding amount of company taxes from both applicants on the solidarity basis with the company. Third, Article 56 of the Civil Code was not relied on by the domestic courts.

The Court notes that the underlying rules of civil, tax and criminal liability, applied in the case of I. and K., were the same as in the applicants’ case.

After 2006 the Russian courts repeatedly stated that company taxes cannot be recovered from its managers convicted under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 451 above).

First, the first case concerned only the pre-trial issues. Furthermore, the Court in that case did not consider some of the evidence, namely the witness statement by Mr Kasyanov, the former Prime Minister, and the report of the Russian President’s expert advisory group, which analysed the applicants’ second trial. There was now a clear global consensus, including judgments from the highest courts in Switzerland and Cyprus, that the applicants’ prosecution was politically motivated. Finally, the Court’s approach to Article 18 in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) was inconsistent with the Convention case-law. The travaux préparatoires for Article 18 indicated that the drafters of this provision were concerned to ensure thereby that an individual was protected from the imposition of restrictions arising from a desire of the State to protect itself according “to the political tendency which it represents” and the desire of the State to act “against an opposition which it considers dangerous”."

Such recognition is apparent from the Court’s approach to Article 14, which like Article 18, has no autonomous place in the Convention but has a particular character in the case-law (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 57325/00, § 186, 13 November 2007).

They also referred to the European Parliament’ Resolution of May 2009 which labelled the first applicant as a political prisoner. The applicants further referred to the judgment of a London court in extradition proceedings against former Yukos executives, where the judge had concluded that the prosecution of Mr Khodorkovskiy had been politically motivated.

In Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) the complaint under Article 18 was examined in conjunction with Article 5 of the Convention and related to the first applicant’s detention on remand during the first months of the investigation. In Yukos the Article 18 complaint was examined in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and related to the tax proceedings against the company and the ensuing enforcement proceedings. In the present case the applicants invoke Article 18 on account of a different set of facts; these facts are connected with the previous examined cases but are, nevertheless, distinguishable from them. Therefore, this complaint is not the same as that previously examined and the Court may continue examination of it.

Thus, the Court has to apply a very exacting standard of proof to such allegations. The Court was satisfied that such standard was met only in few cases, such as Gusinskiy v.

It confirms its position in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) that the applicant alleging bad faith of the authorities must “convincingly show” that their actions were driven by improper motives. Thus, the standard of proof in such cases is high. Otherwise the Court would have to find violations in every high-profile case where the applicant’s status, wealth, reputation, etc. gives rise to a suspicion that the driving force behind his or her prosecution was improper. Such prosecutions as those, for example, at the heart of the case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, would then become impossible. This is definitely not the result which the drafters of that provision sought to achieve.

Examples of such situations can be found in Khodorskovkiy (no.1), § 142, and in Gusinskiy, cited above, §§ 76-77 (see also the Court’s findings under Article 34 of the Convention below).

In essence, the applicants tried to persuade the Court that everything in their case was contrary to the Convention, and that their conviction was therefore invalid.

In the final reckoning, none of the accusations against them concerned their political activities stricto sensu, even remotely. The applicants were not opposition leaders or public officials.

Judging by the number of documents collected and submitted by his legal team it is difficult to imagine that the first applicant’s lawyers were seriously hindered in preparation of the case file for submission to the Court. Thus, the “end result” speaks in favour of the Government’s assertion. However, the Court reiterates that Article 34 may be invoked even if an applicant was able to submit an application, observations, etc. Violations of that provision have been found in many cases where an applicant was successful and the Court found one or several violations of his or her “substantive” rights under the Convention.

The moves made previously by the Russian Government to investigate an applicant’s payments to her representatives, even though they did not apparently result in a criminal prosecution, were also considered by the Court an interference with the exercise of the applicant’s right of individual petition and incompatible with the respondent State’s obligation under Article 34 of the Convention (see Fedotova v.

Furthermore, some of those proceedings took place after the first applicant had submitted the application form. An extraordinary tax audit of the NGO headed by Ms Moskalenko (one of the leading lawyers in his Strasbourg team) could also be explained by reasons not connected to the Yukos case.

The Court is not persuaded by this argument. Although the Court found several violations of the second applicant’s rights under Articles 3, 6 and 8 in the present case, the loss of his earnings can be attributed to many other factors, primarily to the tax proceedings involving Yukos, which eventually led to its bankruptcy and liquidation. The second applicant’s detention throughout 2004 and 2005 undoubtedly played some part in those proceedings. However, the Court does not need to speculate in this respect.

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant ’ s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman ’ s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above).

Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of 3 to 4 square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v.

The applicants alleged that six inmates were held in the cell. The Government, while acknowledging that there were six sleeping places in the cell, stated that the number of inmates varied between five and six but provided no official documents to demonstrate that during the period of the applicants ’ detention fewer then six inmates were held in their cell. In this connection, the Court notes that the overcrowding in the prison in question has been acknowledged by the prison authorities. During the relevant period the occupancy of the prison twice exceeded its official capacity (see paragraph 44 above). The situation was particularly serious as regards remand prisoners (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). The Court therefore finds that even if occasionally they were afforded a little more than 3 square metres of personal space, the applicants were at least for a significant part of their detention held in a cell in which the personal space available to them was 2.7 square metres, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cell. This state of affairs in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sulejmanovic, cited above, §§ 43 and 44, and Modarca v.

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant ’ s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman ’ s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above).

They were also allowed to shower once a day in a shower room which contained partitions between the shower heads.

A request for transfer should be made by the prison governor to the competent domestic court. Section 55 includes overcrowding in the list of grounds for transfer. The Government submitted photocopies of 21 court orders concerning transfers of remand prisoners from Ljubljana prison to other prisons in Slovenia. Most of the orders refer to paragraph 1 of section 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand but do not disclose the exact reasons for the transfer, merely referring to the justification given by the prison governor in his requests, copies of which were not enclosed.

The Administrative Court had full jurisdiction to decide questions of fact and law in such proceedings. According to the Government, such a claim constituted an effective remedy by which the applicants could have secured the immediate termination of the violation. In addition, the Government argued that the applicants could have lodged a request for an interim order and for compensation. As regards the latter, the Administrative Court would rule on such a request unless it would considerably delay the proceedings."

Eight decisions deal with issues of appointments, election and mandates. The remainder concern the refusal to issue an administrative decision, the right to examine a case-file, subscription to a nursery and the payment of compulsory contributions to a Chamber of Commerce. The Government admitted that the decisions did not concern complaints relating to overcrowding or inhuman and degrading conditions in detention.

In particular claimants could seek the termination of an ongoing infringement by means of an injunction.

In this respect they submitted copies of 15 court decisions. Nine of them concern damage caused by environmental nuisances. The others concern damage relating to unlawful detention, defamation, unauthorised publication of photos, sexual assault, distress related to exhumation and the invasion of privacy.

On 20 May 2011 the Government informed the Court that a first judgment on this matter was delivered by the Ljubljana Local Court on 9 May 2011. The court found in favour of the plaintiff, a detainee who spent about six months (in the period between July 2006 and March 2007) in Ljubljana prison as a remand prisoner. For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres. The court found that all four elements of civil tort were established, namely: unlawful act, occurrence of damage, causal link and the defendant ’ s responsibility. The court noted that there had been no jurisprudence on this matter so far and that this was the first judgment to establish the principles for the future. Referring also to Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI, the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the Convention represented minimum standards and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond this minimum. It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation on the Execution of Sentence and was therefore in breach of the claimant ’ s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant ’ s personal rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table and to use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations. Moreover, the court found that these conditions amounted also to a violation of Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The claimant was awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 2,290 euros (EUR)."

At the time when they ordered the applicants ’ detention the courts had no possibility of placing a remand prisoner in another prison with available space (see paragraph 27 above). Once they had been placed in a certain prison, a remand prisoner could be transferred under section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act read together with section 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand, which refers to different grounds for transfer, including overcrowding (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above)."

Moreover, the Court observes that the prison authorities were aware of the overcrowding in the remand section of the prison (see paragraphs 44 ‑ 4 8 above). In 2010 they put in place a system whereby a request for transfer would be made when the number of prisoners exceeded 245 (see paragraph 46 above).

In support of their argument, the Government referred to past decisions of the Administrative Court. However, those decisions arose from situations which do not even remotely relate to that of the applicants (see paragraph 99 above). The Court moreover notes that the claim under the first paragraph of section 4 is conditional on a number of elements, one of them being that the result of the action is unlawful hindrance, limitation or prevention of the enjoyment of a human right and another being the absence of any other judicial protection (see paragraph 35 above). It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of prison conditions. The Court would limit itself to observing that it is unaware of any decision that would demonstrate that a claim concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons could be brought directly to the Administrative Court with any prospect of putting a timely end to an alleged violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ciorap v.

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts.

According to some reports, 739 arrested people were not admitted to SIZO during 2004. TB-infected people were thus held in detention in the ITT, which are not fit for holding such persons, beyond the legally established maximum term of arrest (3 or 10 days). This not only violates the rights of the arrested but also promotes the spread of diseases in the ITT. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 1,000 people are held daily in ITT after the maximum time-limit established by law, including 100 people ill with TB. The situation has not improved even after an Instruction (No. 419-p of 5 July 2004) was issued by the Cabinet of Ministers whereby the State Department for the Execution of Sentences was ordered to ensure admission of those arrested who are ill with TB.

As regards the risk that he might put pressure on witnesses, it was no longer relevant as all the witnesses had already been questioned by the trial court. According to the applicant, the extension of his detention had been based solely on the gravity of the charges against him. The trial had been adjourned for reasons which were not related to his personal situation, but in order to carry out expert psychological examinations of one of the co-accused and to ensure the transfer from Moscow of two prosecution witnesses who were to give evidence against that same co-accused. He asked to be released on bail or on his father ’ s personal guarantee."

Russia it has already found that Russian law does not meet the “quality of law” requirement because the legal provisions governing the interception of communications do not provide for adequate and effective guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse. They are therefore incapable of keeping the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, §§ 302-04). In the present case, however, where the applicant ’ s complaints were based on specific and undisputed instances of covert surveillance, the Court ’ s assessment of the “quality of law”, although it necessarily entails some degree of abstraction, cannot be of the same level of generality as in cases such as Roman Zakharov, which concern general complaints about the law permitting covert surveillance and in which the Court must, of necessity and by way of exception to its normal approach, carry out a completely abstract assessment of such law. In cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva, cited above, § 48)."

                "96. In the Roman Zakharov case the Court has found, in particular, that the judicial authorisation procedures provided for by Russian law are not capable of ensuring that covert surveillance measures are not ordered haphazardly, irregularly or without due and proper consideration. In particular, the CCrP does not instruct judges ordering covert surveillance measures to verify the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned or to apply the “necessity” and “proportionality” tests. The Court has also found it established, on the basis of evidence submitted by the parties, that in their everyday practice the Russian courts do not verify whether there is a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned and do not apply the “necessity” and “proportionality” tests (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, §§ 260-67)."

Furthermore, there is no indication in the text of the surveillance authorisation that the court applied the test of “necessity in a democratic society”, and in particular assessed whether the surveillance measures carried out against the applicant were proportionate to any legitimate aim pursued. In particular, the court failed to recognise that the case involved a conflict between the right to respect for private life and correspondence and other legitimate interests and to perform a balancing exercise. The only reason advanced by the court to justify the surveillance measures was that it “seem[ ed ] impossible to obtain the information necessary to expose [the applicant ’ s] unlawful activities by overt investigation”, without explaining how it had come to that conclusion. The Court does not consider that such a vague and unsubstantiated statement was sufficient to justify the decision to authorise a lengthy (180 days) covert surveillance operation, which entailed a serious interference with the right to respect for the applicant ’ s private life and correspondence."

In the Court ’ s opinion, it is of no importance that at the time of the interception G. had not yet been formally admitted as counsel in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.

In particular, the national law should set out with sufficient clarity and detail: procedures for reporting to an independent supervisory authority for review of cases where material subject to legal professional privilege has been acquired as a result of secret surveillance; procedures for secure destruction of such material; conditions under which it may be retained and used in criminal proceedings and law - enforcement investigations; and, in that case, procedures for safe storage, dissemination of such material and its subsequent destruction as soon as it is no longer required for any of the authorised purposes ( see R.E. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 138 ‑ 39 )."

                "“81. Unlike in Salduz, where the accused, held in custody, had been denied access to a lawyer during police questioning, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was afforded access to a lawyer from his first interrogation, but not ‑ according to his complaint – a lawyer of his own choosing. In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of ‘ denial of choice ’. In such cases the Court ’ s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been ‘ adversely affected ’ to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117- 18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 96-97).",
                "82. It is the latter test which is to be applied in the present case. Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant ’ s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel ’ s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above §§ 58-64); whether the accused ’ s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused ’ s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court ’ s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31, Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-118; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80-82, 25 April 2013). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also took into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody ( Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case ( Salduz, cited above, § 57; and Panovits cited above, §§ 76 and 82). ”"

It follows from the documents in the case file that between December 2003 and August 2004, during the investigation, the applicant was represented by counsel of his own choosing, G. In August 2004, owing to G. ’ s absence on holiday until October 2004, legal aid counsel was appointed to carry out the necessary procedural steps. Several days later G. was removed as the applicant ’ s counsel by reference to the need to question him as a witness about events that had occurred before he had been formally admitted as counsel for the applicant in the criminal proceedings. Immediately after the start of the trial at the beginning of November 2004 the trial court refused to allow the applicant ’ s brother to act as his counsel, finding that the brother was a civil lawyer who had no experience in criminal law and procedure and that the applicant was already represented by experienced legal aid counsel. The next day, however, legal aid counsel was replaced at the applicant ’ s request by counsel of his choosing, AM., who represented him throughout the trial."

The Court will first examine whether there were relevant and sufficient reasons in the interests of justice for refusing to allow the applicant ’ s brother to act as his counsel and for removing G. as the applicant ’ s counsel. In the Court ’ s opinion, the trial court provided relevant and sufficient reasons for the refusal in respect of the applicant ’ s brother, finding that as a lawyer specialising in civil matters he would not be able to ensure efficient defence for the applicant in compliance with the criminal procedure."

            [
                "155. By contrast, the Court is not persuaded that the reasons advanced for removing G. were relevant and sufficient. The only reason for removing G. was the investigator ’ s finding that it would be useful to question him about the telephone conversations he had had with the applicant before he had been formally admitted as his counsel in the criminal proceedings. The Court notes in this connection that the domestic law does not provide for the removal of counsel in order to question him or her as a witness (see paragraph 79 above). The Advocates Act explicitly prohibits the questioning of an advocate about matters which have become known to him or her as a result of representing the client or as a result of an application for legal representation by a prospective client (see paragraph 82 above). As explained by the Constitutional Court, legal professional privilege covers all information which has become known to an advocate as a result of representing his or her client, including any information communicated by the client before the advocate had been formally admitted as counsel in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 83 above). It is also significant that the domestic law at the material time did not provide for an exception to the legal professional privilege in the case of its suspected abuse, for example in furtherance of criminal or fraudulent conduct. In any event, there is no evidence in the case file that disciplinary or criminal proceedings were opened against G. in connection with any abuses committed while representing the applicant."

                "156. The Court reiterates that communications between a lawyer and his client, whatever their purpose, enjoy privileged status where confidentiality is concerned. It attaches particular weight to the risk of impingement on the lawyer ’ s right to professional secrecy, since it may have repercussions on the proper administration of justice. Strengthened protection of exchanges between lawyers and their clients is justified by the fact that lawyers are assigned a fundamental role in a democratic society, that of defending litigants. Yet lawyers cannot carry out this essential task if there is no guarantee that their exchanges with those they are defending will remain confidential. Indirectly but necessarily dependent thereupon is the right of everyone to a fair trial, including the right of accused persons not to incriminate themselves (see, in the context of Article 8, Michaud, cited above, §§ 117-18, with further references). It is true that legal professional privilege is not inviolable and may be overridden by other important considerations (see, by way of example, situations described in Michaud, cited above, § 123, and Versini-Campinchi and Crasnianski v. France, no. 49176/11, § 78, 16 June 2016). Exceptions to the legal professional privilege must be however strictly defined, be attended by adequate and sufficient guarantees against abuse and, most importantly, should not affect the client ’ s defence rights (see, in the context of Article 8, Versini ‑ Campinchi and Crasnianski, cited above, §§ 79 and 80)."

There is no evidence in the case file that any significant investigative measures involving the applicant, such as questioning, were carried out during the two-month period while the applicant was represented by appointed legal aid counsel. It is noteworthy that during most of that period, G. was in any case unavailable to represent the applicant, being on annual leave. It is also important to note that legal aid counsel was appointed only after it had been proposed that the applicant retain another lawyer of his choosing and he had declined to do so. In so far as the applicant alleged that legal aid counsel had been ineffective, the Court notes that he has not substantiated any examples of the lawyer ’ s manifest negligence. As soon as the applicant expressed a wish to be represented by another lawyer of his choosing, AM., his request was allowed and AM. was immediately admitted as his counsel. He represented the applicant throughout the remainder of the criminal proceedings against him. Lastly, the Court observes that G. was ultimately not questioned as a witness against the applicant."

Whether such cramped conditions result from an excessive number of detainees being transported together or from the restrictive design of compartments is immaterial for the Court’s analysis, which is focused on the objective conditions of transfer as they were and their effect on the applicants, rather than on their causes. The low height of the ceiling, especially of single-prisoner cubicles, which forces prisoners to stoop, may exacerbate physical suffering and fatigue. Inadequate protection from outside temperatures, when prisoner cells are not sufficiently heated or ventilated, will constitute an aggravating factor (see the case-law cited in paragraph 118 above)."

A shorter seventh bunk, 50 centimetres wide and 1.6 metres long, bridges the gap between the two middle bunks. The “bridge” bunk makes it impossible to stand upright in the compartment. According to the Conveyance Instruction, a large compartment is suitable for transporting up to twelve people on long ‑ distance journeys or up to sixteen people for short distances. Counsel for the FSIN explained in the proceedings before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 69 below) the manner in which sixteen people were accommodated in a large compartment: five prisoners seated on each of the two lower bunks, one prisoner lying on each of the two upper bunks, and four people seated on the middle bunks joined together with the bridge bunk. In 2012, the Supreme Court held that the occupancy limits established in the Conveyance Instruction for long-distance journeys were incompatible with international law (see paragraph 69 below)."

Taking into account that large groups of people are still deprived of an effective domestic remedy and thus compelled to seek redress in the Court for repetitive violations of their Convention rights, the Court raised a question of principle as to the existence of a systemic problem and put an emphasis on Article 13, which gives direct expression to the States’ obligation, enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention, to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal systems (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). However, the Government’s declarations by which they sought to settle these cases did not contain any undertaking to address the crucial Convention issue under the Convention which continues to affect hundreds of prisoners in Russia. The Court also notes in this connection the Government’s submission to the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 of the Convention that no action plan was required to tackle the large-scale problem of the conditions of prisoners’ transfer (see paragraph 78 in fine above). Acceptance of the Government’s request to strike the present applications out of the Court’s list would leave the current situation unchanged, without any guarantee that a genuine solution would be found in the near future (compare Gerasimov and Others, cited above, § 138). Nor would it advance the fulfilment of the Court’s task under Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto” (ibid.)."

Russian law requires that a preventive custodial measure should be reviewed and extended at regular intervals. Detention hearings are normally conducted in the presence of the detainee. In the absence of any documents showing exceptional grounds for dispensing with Ms Punegova’s participation in the detention hearings during the ten-month period, the Court lends credence to her submission that she had been transferred by prison van to the town court at regular intervals. The Court is also satisfied that the conditions of transfer have remained relevantly similar during the entire period: she was invariably placed in a single-person cell of the prison van because the Conveyance Instruction required that female prisoners be separated from male prisoners during transfers (see paragraph 66 above)."

Even the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase a detainee by placing him or her in poor conditions, while being a factor to be taken into account, does not rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, since it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penal system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see Muršić v.

Afflicted with diabetes, she had a corpulent body. Her condition called for a generous allocation of seating space and good access to ventilation, so as to make her conditions of transfer more bearable. However, the authorities in charge of the transfer did not consider her special needs. To make matters worse, they put another woman together with her for the duration of each journey. The Court concedes that in doing so, they were following to the letter the regulations requiring separation of the sexes, and that is what the officials relied on to justify their conduct (see paragraph 35 above). The Court cannot accept it, however, as justification for putting Ms Kostromina in a situation of extreme physical hardship. It finds that the approach adopted by the convoy officers disclosed a disregard for the well-being of transported prisoners that was incompatible with respect for human dignity."

The duration of her transfers however was much shorter in the initial period, sometimes as short as three minutes (see paragraph 27 above). She did not provide any information about the distance travelled or the duration of transfers in the subsequent months (see paragraph 28 above). The transfers in that period also appear to have been infrequent, occurring as they did at two-monthly intervals.

She underwent at least ten transfers over a two ‑ month period, spending each time a total of one hour and ten minutes in a single ‑ prisoner cell on the way to and from the court hearings. One specific feature of the cell design stands out. The cell was assembled from metal sheets that formed a fully enclosed cubicle with air holes in the door (see paragraph 17 above). This design guaranteed complete isolation of the prisoner from the non-secure area of the van. However, it also had the effect of thermally insulating the cell, blocking the flow of heat from the heater located in the central aisle into the cubicle. There was no heating inside the cell and, as the rear panel was attached directly to the outer panel of the van, the cold was transferred from the outside. The Court holds that the conditions of Ms Punegova’s transport during the trial, which were marked by a shortage of space and exposure to low temperatures, were in breach of Article 3."

Railways fall under the jurisdiction of transport prosecutors who are tasked with supervising the application of laws and ensuring respect for human rights and freedoms. However, as the Court has observed, infringement reports or orders issued by a prosecutor are primarily matters between the supervising authority and the supervised body and are not geared towards providing preventive or compensatory redress to the aggrieved individual. There is no legal requirement compelling the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint (ibid.). Furthermore, it does not appear that prisoners in transit have a way of reaching out to a transport prosecutor to secure his or her expeditious intervention if the conditions of transport fall foul of legal requirements or amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. In case of Mr Rakov, the prosecutor’s reply came almost two months after the events (see paragraph 40 above)."

Lastly, turning to the effectiveness of judicial remedies, the Court observes that, however diligently the proceedings before courts are conducted, they would normally conclude too late to be able to put an end to a situation involving an ongoing violation. Unlike the conditions in a remand prison or penal facility which the prisoner endures for months or years, transfers take a much shorter time, in the range of days or weeks. Nevertheless, the fact that the courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint even after the end of a transfer, establish the facts and make redress tailored to the nature of the violation makes the judicial remedy prima facie accessible and capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate compensatory redress."

They require the claimant to show that the damage was caused through an unlawful action or omission on the part of the specific State authority or official. This requirement establishes an unattainable burden of proof in cases, such as the present one, in which every individual aspect of the conditions complied with domestic regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 141 above).

The judicial decisions that the applicants made available in the present case highlight the shortcomings of that formalistic approach (see paragraphs 71 to 74 above). In the case of the applicant Mr Vasilyev, the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic overruled the first ‑ instance court’s finding of formal compatibility with the regulations and carried out a cumulative assessment of the conditions of transport, applying the criteria which the Court had developed in its case-law. That judgment, however, did not withstand a review before the Presidium of the same court, which reverted to the established standard of formal compliance with the applicable regulations. The subsequent decisions in Mr Vasilyev’s cases and many others followed that line of reasoning. It is a matter of particular concern that the Supreme Court described actual bodily injury as a required element of inhuman and degrading treatment and also appeared to suggest that suffering caused by the conditions of transport was conducive to the rehabilitation of offenders (see paragraph 74 above)."

The Conveyance Instruction made no provision for distributing bed linen or hot water, or for securing adequate access to a toilet. Prisoners were not allowed access to the toilet in old-style Soviet prisoner carriages while they were stationary because human waste was discharged directly onto the railway tracks.

It thus feels compelled to address the underlying structural problems in greater depth, to examine the source of those problems and to provide further assistance to the respondent State in finding appropriate solutions and to the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the judgments (see Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences).",

                "183. The Court recognises that the recurrent violations of Article 3 resulting from inadequate conditions of transport are an issue of considerable magnitude and complexity. It is a multifaceted problem owing its existence to a large number of negative factors, such as the geographical remoteness of many penal facilities which had been built far from major cities under the former regime, the long distances involved, the ageing rolling stock, exceedingly restrictive regulations and standards, and a lack of transparency during prisoner transportation. This situation requires comprehensive general measures at national level, which must take into consideration a large number of individuals who are currently affected by it. With a view to assisting the respondent State to fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court will seek to outline measures that might be instrumental in resolving the structural problem in compliance with the Convention, as it has done in a number of cases concerning the similarly complex issue of inhuman conditions of detention (see Varga and Others, cited above, § 102; Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 154, 22 October 2009; Norbert Sikorski v.

The Court notes that, following conviction, a significant number of prisoners are sent to serve their sentences thousands of kilometres away from their hometowns or places where their family lives. Owing to historical and geographical factors, penal facilities are unevenly distributed throughout the Russian territory and most of them are far removed from the densely populated areas. Thus, the Moscow capital region has six penal facilities for a combined population of 22,000,000, while the Komi Republic has twice as many for a population of 900,000. Article 73 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences establishes a general rule on geographical distribution of prisoners, according to which prisoners should be allocated to penal facilities where they had lived or where they had been convicted, save in “exceptional cases” (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The spirit and the objective of Article 73 was to preserve prisoners’ social and family ties (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 850, 25 July 2013)."

In practice, however, the FSIN may override the requirements of the general distribution rule in Article 73 and allocate prisoners to a remote facility, without giving the reasons for such decisions (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The case of Mr Tomov, Mr Roshka and Mr Barinov, who were sent to serve their sentence in a penal facility some 2,200 kilometres away from Syktyvkar, is an illustration of this practice. Allocation to a remote facility results in longer and more arduous journeys for prisoners in transit, which may take up to a month from the starting point to the destination, as was the case for Mr Tomov and others."

The emphasis should be on placing prisoners as close to their home as possible so as to save them from the hardships of a long railway journey, to reduce the number of prisoners travelling by rail to faraway destinations, and also to avoid the burden of long and expensive journeys which visiting family members would have to bear.",

The seating arrangements for prison vans and railway carriages used for short-distance train journeys need to be reviewed with a view to guaranteeing sufficient space per person and a more even distribution of prisoners in compartments. Unless mandated by compelling security considerations, the use of single-prisoner stakan -type cubicles should be avoided. Elements that impede prisoners from standing up, such as bridge bunks in large compartments of prisoner railway carriages, will need to be uninstalled. On longer rail journeys, special care should be taken to ensure decent sleeping arrangements for prisoners. Each of them should have his or her own sleeping place, and adequate access to sanitary facilities, drinking water and food should be secured."

The conditions of transport are to be individualised and tailored to the needs of prisoners who cannot be transported in ordinary conditions on account of a mental condition or physical characteristics, such as obesity.

In view of the time that has elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 211). For the respondent Government to comply with its obligations flowing from, clear and specific changes are required in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inhuman or degrading conditions of transport and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level."

To be efficient, the system must ensure a prompt and diligent handling of prisoners’ complaints, secure their effective participation in the examination of grievances, and provide a wide range of legal tools for the purpose of eradicating the identified breach of Convention requirements. Lastly, prisoners must be able to avail themselves of remedies without having to fear that they will incur punishment or negative consequences for doing so (see Neshkov and Others, cited above, § 191, and section 70 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, quoted in Butko, cited above, § 21)."

Those findings are applicable to complaints about conditions of transport, too. Public monitoring commissions may also be given a more prominent role in upholding the rights of prisoners in transit. To be truly effective, however, they will need an extended mandate and the power to render binding decisions. It is a matter for the Russian authorities to decide what kind of reform could be envisaged (see, for examples of implemented preventive remedies in conditions-of-detention cases, Stella and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 49169/09, §§ 46-55, 16 September 2014, and Domján v. Hungary (dec.), no. 5433/17, §§ 21-23, 14 November 2017)."

The introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 221)."

In particular, monetary compensation should be accessible to any current or former inmate who has suffered inhuman or degrading treatment and has made an application to this effect. A finding that the conditions fell short of the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention will give rise to a strong presumption that they have caused non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved person, and the level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (ibid., §§ 228-30, and see, in particular, on the award that can be considered acceptable, Domján, cited above, §§ 27-28). In the particular context of the present case, the Court reiterates that domestic courts should be able to appreciate that, even in a situation where every individual aspect of the conditions of transport complied with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect could have been such as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment.",

While rehabilitation was recognised as a means of preventing recidivism, more recently and more positively it constitutes rather the idea of re-socialisation through the fostering of personal responsibility. This objective is reinforced by the development of the “progression principle”: in the course of serving a sentence, a prisoner should move progressively through the prison system thereby moving from the early days of a sentence, when the emphasis may be on punishment and retribution, to the latter stages, when the emphasis should be on preparation for release.",

Only the right to liberty was automatically removed by a sentence of imprisonment. A State had to justify the limitation of any other rights. The starting- point of the Policy was therefore wrong and should be reversed: the Policy should be that prisoners had a right to procreate unless there were compelling reasons against. This inversed structure prevented any real assessment of each individual case : it was necessary to show that, but for artificial insemination, conception would be impossible and, thereafter, exceptional circumstances had to be demonstrated. The odds were thereby so stacked against the grant of facilities that there was no real individual assessment and the result was a foregone conclusion so that the Policy amounted to a blanket ban."

If one had to choose, they argued that a refusal of artificial insemination facilities constituted an interference with a right to beget children (negative obligation). The suggestion that it had to be analysed as a positive obligation presupposed that the aim of imprisonment and of the Policy was punishment so that, as noted above, one lost one ’ s fundamental rights (including the right to beget children) on imprisonment as part of that punishment. Once it was accepted that a prisoner retained his Convention rights on imprisonment and was simply requesting a procedure to facilitate one of those rights, that request had to be analysed in the negative obligation context. Even if an onerous burden on the State could be analysed in the positive obligation context, there was evidently none and the Government did not argue that there was: the applicants would have paid any costs and there was no burden on security or facilities except for access to the prison by an approved visitor to take away the sample."

The Court could not hide behind the margin it felt should be accorded in the present case. On the contrary, the refusal was based on a Policy which had never been subjected to parliamentary consideration and which allowed for no real proportionality examination domestically: the margin of appreciation had no role to play in such circumstances.

The concept of the wider public interest was vague, ill-defined and there was, in any event, no evidence that providing the requested facilities would undermine public confidence in the penal system. The suggestion that the best interests of the child were relevant to the grant of facilities was offensive, inappropriate, paternalistic and unconvincing: it was the thin edge of the wedge as regards judging who should become parents and who should be born (Codd, “ Regulating Reproduction: Prisoners ’ Families, Artificial Insemination and Human Rights ” [2006] EHRLR 1); it was inconsistent with the principle of rehabilitation; it was unconvincing and injurious to assume that being raised by a single parent was necessarily not in the child ’ s best interests; and the interests of the child as a justification was specious as it suggested that the only way to protect that child ’ s interest was to ensure it was never born. These arguments were also insulting to single parents and, indeed, against domestic legal developments which minimised this factor in its jurisprudence in other non-prisoner artificial insemination cases ( R v. Blood [1997] 2 WLR 806 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003). This effectively put the burden on the parent to prove that he or she could be a good parent (including financially).

It was unfair to state that their relationship had not been tested: the strength of any relationship (prisoner or other) was uncertain, there was no link between imprisonment and dissolution of relationships and, indeed, the first applicant ’ s imprisonment had not weakened their relationship. In any event, this latter argument was circuitous as it could automatically negate any request for artificial insemination facilities from such long-term prisoners. It was equally unjust and circular to argue that the first applicant would be initially absent: long- term absence was a necessary starting- point to apply for the requested facilities (artificial insemination being the only means of conception ) but at the same time it meant artificial insemination could not be granted (given the consequent separation from any child conceived).

This latter point was indeed a complex and controversial one, underlining why the State authorities were best placed to make this assessment. It was legitimate that the State considered implications for any children conceived so that one of the aims of the Policy was to limit the grant of artificial insemination facilities to those who could reasonably be expected to be released into a stable family setting and play a parental role.

That starting- point was, in the Government ’ s view, a reasonable one. It would be frequently the case that the refusal of artificial insemination facilities would not affect rights guaranteed by Article 8. This would be the case, for example, where a child was conceived in whose life the father would, as a consequence of his imprisonment, have no real involvement, the mere right to procreate not being a Convention right. It would only be in unusual circumstances that the duration of imprisonment would, without artificial insemination, prevent a prisoner from having children after his release.

However, while the Court has expressed its approval for the evolution in several European countries towards conjugal visits, it has not yet interpreted the Convention as requiring Contracting States to make provision for such visits (see Aliev, cited above, § 188). Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting States could enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals."

However, and even assuming that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Mellor case amounted to judicial consideration of the Policy under Article 8 ( despite its pre-incorporation and judicial review context, see paragraphs 23-26 above), the Court considers that the Policy as structured effectively excluded any real weighing of the competing individual and public interests, and prevented the required assessment of the proportionality of a restriction, in any individual case.",
                "In particular, and having regard to the judgment of Lord Phillips in the Mellor case and of Auld LJ in the present case, the Policy placed an inordinately high “exceptionality” burden on the applicants when requesting artificial insemination facilities ( see paragraphs 13, 15-17 and 23-26 above). They had to demonstrate, in the first place, as a condition precedent to the application of the Policy, that the deprivation of artificial insemination facilities might prevent conception altogether (the “starting- point”). Secondly, and of even greater significance, they had to go on to demonstrate that the circumstances of their case were “exceptional” within the meaning of the remaining criteria of the Policy ( the “ finishing- point”). The Court considers that even if the applicants ’ Article 8 complaint was before the Secretary of State and the Court of Appeal, the Policy set the threshold so high against them from the outset that it did not allow a balancing of the competing individual and public interests and a proportionality test by the Secretary of State or by the domestic courts in their case, as required by the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady, cited above, § 138 )."

In addition, there is no evidence that when fixing the Policy the Secretary of State sought to weigh the relevant competing individual and public interests or assess the proportionality of the restriction. Further, since the Policy was not embodied in primary legislation, the various competing interests were never weighed, nor issues of proportionality ever assessed, by Parliament (see Hirst, § 79, and Evans, §§ 86-89, both cited above ). Indeed, the Policy was adopted, as noted in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Mellor case ( see paragraph 23 above), prior to the incorporation of the Convention into domestic law."

Whatever the precise reason for the dearth of applications for such facilities and the refusal of the majority of the few requests maintained, the Court does not consider that the statistics provided by the Government undermine the above finding that the Policy did not permit the required proportionality assessment in an individual case. Neither was it persuasive to argue, as the Government did, that the starting- point of exceptionality was reasonable since only a few persons would be affected, implying as it did the possibility of justifying the restriction of the applicants ’ Convention rights by the minimal number of persons adversely affected."

Indeed, the initial charge of violent overthrow of State power, which was a particularly serious criminal offence according to the domestic classification, had been accepted by the District Court on 8 February 2005 without any inquiry having been carried out, although it was later amended to a lesser charge of participation in mass disorders. Nevertheless, on 1 4 April 2005 the same court stated in the extension order that the amended charge was also “well-founded”, without citing any reasons for that finding (compare Dolgova, cited above, § 42)."

After the case had been submitted for trial in June 2005 the trial court used the same summary formula to refuse the petitions for release and extend the pre-trial detention of thirty-nine persons, notwithstanding the defence ’ s express request that each detainee ’ s situation be dealt with individually. The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee was incompatible, in itself, with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no. 7649/02, § 45, 14 December 2006; Korchuganova, cited above, § 76; and Dolgova, cited above, § 49).

In the decisions of 27 September and 3 October 2005 rejecting the applications for release the courts relied for the first time in the proceedings on the applicant ’ s Dutch nationality as a reason to believe that he might abscond. The Court accepts that a detainee ’ s foreign nationality could be a relevant factor in assessing the risk of flight. However, the danger of an accused absconding does not result just because it is possible or easy for him to cross the frontier : there must be a whole set of circumstances, such as, particularly, the lack of well-established ties in the country, which give reason to suppose that the consequences and hazards of flight will seem to him to be a lesser evil than continued imprisonment (see Stögmüller v. Austria, judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, § 15). The domestic courts did not mention any such circumstance in their decisions or point to any specific aspects of the applicant ’ s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that the applicant presented a persistent flight risk. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts showing his close ties with Russia that mitigated the risk of his absconding abroad, such as his permanent place of residence and family in Russia and ongoing studies at a Russian university. In any event, the applicant, who was also a Russian national, could only cross the Russian border with his Russian travel passport (see paragraph 53 above). The domestic authorities did not explain why the withdrawal of his Russian travel passport, a measure explicitly envisaged in domestic law for removing flight risks, would not have been sufficient to prevent him from absconding abroad."

                "82. The Court further observes that when deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities have an obligation under Article 5 § 3 to consider alternative measures of ensuring his or her appearance at trial. This Convention provision proclaims not only the right to “trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial” but also lays down that “release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial” (see Sulaoja, cited above, § 64 in fine, 15 February 2005; and Jabłoński, cited above, § 83 ). In the present case the authorities never considered the possibility of ensuring the applicant ’ s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure, although many times his lawyers asked for his release on bail and provided the domestic courts with the personal surety of a human-rights activist."

The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts prolonged an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formula without addressing concrete facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § § 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § § 103 et seq., ECHR 2006 ‑ ... (extracts); Mamedova v. Russia, cited above, §§ 72 et seq.; Dolgova v.

The Court is aware of the fact that a majority of the above-mentioned cases concerned longer periods of deprivation of liberty and that against that background one year may be regarded as a relatively short period spent in detention. Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, however, cannot be seen as authorising detention unconditionally provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003 ‑ I (extracts) ). The fact that the maximum time-limit permitted by the domestic law was not exceeded is not a decisive element for the Court ’ s assessment, either. The calculation of the domestic time-limits depended solely on the gravity of the charges (see paragraph 51 above) which was decided upon by the prosecution and was not subject to an effective judicial review (see Shcheglyuk, cited above, § 43 )."

In these circumstances is not necessary to examine whether the proceedings were conducted with “special diligence”."

In a number of cases it considered complaints about the rejection of a detainee ’ s request for permission to visit an ailing relative or attend a relatives ’ funeral under Article 8 of the Convention (see Schemkamper v.

Accordingly, the refusals to release the applicant so that he could see his father on his deathbed and attend the farewell ceremony for him interfered with the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that any interference with an individual ’ s right to respect for his private and family life will constitute a breach of Article 8, unless it was “in accordance with the law”, pursued a legitimate aim or aims under paragraph 2, and was “necessary in a democratic society” in the sense that it was proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved (see, among other authorities, Elsholz v.

It is up to the domestic authorities to assess each request on its merits. The Court ’ s scrutiny is limited to consideration of the impugned measures in the context of the applicant ’ s Convention rights, taking into account the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States (see, mutatis mutandis, Płoski, cited above, § 38). At the same time the Court emphasises that even if a detainee by the very nature of his situation must be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as necessary in a democratic society. It is the duty of the State to demonstrate that such necessity really existed, that is, to demonstrate the existence of a pressing social need (see Schemkamper, cited above, § 3 3)."

                "95. In the cases of Schemkamper, Sannino, and Płoski (all cited above) the Court had regard to the following factors to assess whether the refusals of leave to visit a sick relative or to attend a relative ’ s funeral were “necessary in a democratic society”: the stage of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the nature of the criminal offence, the applicant ’ s character, the gravity of the relative ’ s illness, the degree of kinship, the possibility of escorted leave, and so on. Thus, a violation of Article 8 was found in the Płoski case, where the applicant, who had not been convicted, was charged with a non-violent crime and sought leave to attend the funerals of his parents, who died within one month of each other, whereas the authorities did not give compelling reasons for the refusal and did not consider the possibility of escorted leave. By contrast, in the Sannino case, the refusal was justified because the applicant had been convicted of murder and was of dubious character. He sought leave to visit his grandfather who was not a close relative and whose state of health was not really precarious. In the most recent case, Schemkamper, the Court also found the refusal justified because the applicant ’ s father was not so unwell as to be unable to visit the applicant in prison."

He had asked for euthanasia, which was scheduled for 29 September 2005. It is the distinguishing feature of this case that the date of the applicant ’ s father ’ s death was known in advance and that he was to die within a matter of days. It was therefore the last opportunity for the applicant and his father to meet. Given that the applicant ’ s father was in hospital in a grave condition, it was unrealistic to expect him to visit his son in detention. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances of the case and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined the applicant ’ s request for release with particular attention and scrutiny."

It understands the apprehension of the domestic authorities that the applicant might not return from abroad. It notes in this connection that it was open to the Russian authorities to seek assistance from the Dutch authorities. The Russian authorities did not consider applying for such assistance, despite the fact that the Dutch Ambassador had contacted them at least three times to request the applicant ’ s release (see paragraphs 27, 31 and 36 above). Nevertheless, given that the domestic authorities are better placed than the European Court to assess the matter, the Court is unable to find that, in refusing to release the applicant so that he could visit his dying father in The Hague or attend the farewell ceremony, the domestic authorities exceeded the margin appreciation afforded to them."

The conversation lasted a minute and was interrupted by the facility administration. The Government did not provide any explanation for the interruption of the conversation.

The treatment he was receiving was incomplete and the medical supervision afforded to him was insufficient to maintain his health. There had been no thorough evaluation of his condition or adequate diagnosis in response to the increasing number of his health-related complaints. The medical personnel of the detention facilities were taking no steps to address his concerns or to apply the recommendation of the experts commissioned by the applicant. The poor quality of the medical services was accentuated by the fact that the applicant was being kept in unsterile and unsanitary detention conditions posing a serious danger to him, given that his immune system was already compromised. The Court is also concerned that the information provided by the prison doctor from the detention facility in Rostov-on-Don in respect of the quality of the medical care currently afforded to the applicant does not lead it to conclude that the medical care he is continuing to receive in detention is such as to be capable of securing his health and well-being and preventing further aggravation of his condition (see paragraph 49 above). The Court believes that, as a result of the lack of comprehensive and adequate medical treatment, the applicant is being exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering that is diminishing his human dignity.

In particular, the District Court relied on the medical opinions of 17 July and 7 August 2013, which had found that the applicant ’ s illness was not among those listed in Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011 preventing the detention of a suspect. It further stressed that on a daily basis at least three medical specialists from municipal and State medical facilities (“generalists, surgeons, neurologists, urologists, endocrinologists, proctologists, an infectious diseases specialist, and a rehabilitation specialist”) had examined the applicant and that he had received the prescribed drug treatment in full. Moreover, he had undergone all the necessary laboratory testing and clinical examinations in certified civilian laboratories in Moscow and on 5 November 2013 he was to undergo yet another expert examination to determine whether he was suffering from any illness warranting his release. Having cited a long list of the applicant ’ s illnesses, the District Court noted that there was no evidence that his condition had deteriorated or that he required treatment in a specialised medical facility. The District Court dismissed as unreliable various expert opinions and medical records prepared by specialists, including foreign ones, in various related fields of medicine and produced by the defence in support of their argument that the applicant ’ s life was being put at risk by his prolonged detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility and in the absence of adequate medical assistance."

Having again assessed the materials presented to it by the investigation and the defence, the District Court concluded that the risks of the applicant influencing witnesses, reoffending, obstructing the investigation by other means and absconding were still present. In particular, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were at a crucial stage of collecting evidence and there was a risk that, using his connections in the criminal underworld, the applicant might try to influence witnesses and victims who feared him. The District Court also cited the medical reports of 17 July, 7 August and 8 November 2013, which supported its conclusion that the applicant ’ s state of health did not preclude his further detention."

Their report dated 2 July 2013 found that, due to his inability to satisfy his most basic needs (such as moving, urinating or defecating) without help and to his very serious diseases, the applicant required constant medical supervision, treatment and assistance and that he should therefore be placed in a specialised medical facility. His detention in a temporary detention facility could aggravate his condition and, in the absence of a swift reaction to such an aggravation, could result in his death.

Blood and urine tests were regularly performed. He was prescribed and administered various medications. The applicant used disposable catheters to urinate. He performed that procedure himself, as he had done before his arrest, up to ten times a day without the facility administration having the possibility of ensuring the requisite level of asepsis.

On 25 July 2013 the two experts issued their review of the report.

In those circumstances, the Court had asked the Government to subject the applicant to an independent medical examination and raised three questions which medical experts had to answer. The Government, however, had refused to organise such an examination. Moreover, the applicant ’ s efforts to organise such an examination by independent specialists in the detention facility had also been unsuccessful.

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 102, ECHR 2005 ‑ I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Naydyon v. Ukraine, no. 16474/03, § 63, 14 October 2010; Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, § 156, 26 July 2012; and Iulian Popescu v. Romania, no. 24999/04, § 33, 4 June 2013)."

The Court cannot emphasise enough the special importance attached to interim measures in the Convention system. Their purpose is not only to enable an effective examination of the application to be carried out but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; such measures subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of the final judgment. Interim measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, § 125; Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 473, ECHR 2005 ‑ III; Aoulmi v. France, no. 50278/99, § 108, ECHR 2006 ‑ I; and Ben Khemais v. Italy, no. 246/07, § 82, 24 February 2009)."

In most of these cases, the applicants face a genuine threat to life and limb, with the ensuing real risk of grave, irreversible harm in breach of the core provisions of the Convention. The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties ’ compliance with the Court ’ s indications in that regard (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration and by the Committee of Ministers in Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the above-mentioned case of Ben Khemais ).

The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument. It reiterates that the aim of the interim measure in the present case, as formulated in the Court ’ s decision of 16 August 2013, was to obtain an independent medical expert assessment of the state of the applicant ’ s health, the quality of the treatment he was receiving and the adequacy of the conditions of his detention for his medical needs. That expert evidence was necessary to decide whether, as the applicant argued, his life and limb were at real risk as a result of the conditions of his detention, including the alleged lack of requisite medical care. In addition, the Court was concerned with the contradictory nature of the medical reports prepared by the applicant ’ s experts and those commissioned by the investigators, which the applicant submitted with his application and his request for an interim measure. The interim measure in the present case was therefore also meant to ensure that the applicant could effectively pursue his case before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Shtukaturov v.

The main purpose of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case – and the Government did not pretend to be unaware of it – was to prevent the applicant ’ s exposure to inhuman and degrading suffering in view of his poor health and his remaining in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility that was unable to ensure that he received, as he argued, adequate medical assistance.

While not doubting the professional expertise and qualifications of the doctors who prepared the medical reports of 17 July and 7 August 2013, as well as their independence from the penal system, their opinion reflected in the two reports did not provide any answers to the three questions put forward by the Court. Although the Court is mindful of the particularly harsh criticism to which the two reports were subjected by the experts appointed by the applicant, to the point of being described as incomplete, subjective and failing to reflect the “true picture of [the applicant ’ s] pathology” (see paragraphs 26 and 39 above), it finds it more important that the aim of the two medical examinations, the results of which were set out in the reports submitted by the Government, was to compare the applicant ’ s medical condition with the exhaustive list of illnesses provided for by the Governmental Decree, which could have warranted his release (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). At no point during the examinations did the doctors from hospital no. 20 assess the applicant ’ s state of health independently from that list or evaluate whether his illnesses, separately or in combination, given their current manifestation, nature and duration, required his transfer to a hospital. Nor did they pay any attention to the quality of the medical care he had been receiving while in detention, or the conditions in which he was being detained.

The Court cannot conceive, therefore, of allowing the authorities to circumvent an interim measure such as the one indicated in the present case by replacing the medical expert opinion with their own assessment of the applicant ’ s situation. Yet, that is exactly what the Government have done in the present case (see paragraphs 32 - 35 above). In so doing, the State has frustrated the purpose of the interim measure, which sought to enable the Court, on the basis of a relevant independent medical opinion, to effectively respond to and, if need be, prevent the possible continuous exposure of the applicant to physical and mental suffering in violation of the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention (see Salakhov and Islyamova v.

While the authorities, in their replies to the applicant ’ s complaints, had acknowledged that the conditions in the detention facility did not satisfy the simple requirements of hygiene and sterility, they had taken no steps to change that situation. The medical recommendations issued by specialists prior to his arrest were costly and complex, as could be seen from various medical reports submitted by him to the Court, and could not be complied with by the untrained and poorly qualified medical personnel of the detention facility.

The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention ‑ conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, § 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein)."

The Court reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that where the events at issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, damage and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Oleg Nikitin v. Russia, no. 36410/02, § 45, 9 October 2008 ). In the absence of such an explanation the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see, for instance, Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 274, 18 June 2002, and Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, § 161, 5 June 2012 ).",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour (see, for example, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill ‑ treatment must, however, attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Verbinţ v. Romania, no. 7842/04, § 63, 3 April 2012, with further references)."

However, even in the absence of these, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual ’ s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 52, ECHR 2002-III, with further references)."

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 92-94, ECHR 2000-XI, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 208, 13 July 2006). In most cases concerning the detention of persons who were ill, the Court has examined whether or not the applicant received adequate medical assistance in prison. The Court reiterates in this regard that even though Article 3 does not entitle a detainee to be released “on compassionate grounds”, it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and well-being of detainees, among other things, as an obligation on the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła, cited above, § 94; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, § 95, ECHR 2002-VI; and Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 96, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts))."

Relying on a large number of expert opinions issued by Russian and foreign medical specialists, the applicant argued that his condition was extremely serious, or even life-threatening, particularly given that he had not received adequate medical care in detention (see paragraphs 22, 26, 38 - 43 above). He submitted that neither the quality nor the quantity of the medical services he was being provided with corresponded to his needs.

Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a “particularly thorough scrutiny” (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.

In the absence of an effective remedy in Russia to air those complaints, the Court has been obliged to perform the first-hand evaluation of evidence before it to determine whether the guarantees of Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention had been respected.

Coming back to the medical reports and opinions submitted by the applicant in the present case, the Court is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of his submissions and that the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government. The Court finds some merit in the Government ’ s argument that the expert evidence produced by the applicant has the major defect of having been drawn up without the experts having examined the applicant in person. However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, it does not consider that argument valid given that the Government failed to organise a medical expert examination of the applicant in disregard of the interim measure indicated by the Court (see paragraph 75 above) and given that the Russian authorities denied the applicant access to medical experts of his choice (see paragraph 74 above)."

Having regard to its findings under Article 34 of the Convention, the Court considers that it can draw inferences from the Government ’ s conduct and is ready to apply a particularly thorough scrutiny to the evidence submitted by them in support of their position. It therefore finds that the Government have failed to demonstrate conclusively that the applicant was receiving effective medical treatment for his illnesses while in detention. The evidence submitted by the Government is unconvincing and insufficient to rebut the applicant ’ s account of the treatment to which he was being subjected in detention."

The treatment he was receiving was incomplete and the medical supervision afforded to him was insufficient to maintain his health. There had been no thorough evaluation of his condition or adequate diagnosis in response to the increasing number of his health-related complaints. The medical personnel of the detention facilities were taking no steps to address his concerns or to apply the recommendation of the experts commissioned by the applicant. The poor quality of the medical services was accentuated by the fact that the applicant was being kept in unsterile and unsanitary detention conditions posing a serious danger to him, given that his immune system was already compromised. The Court is also concerned that the information provided by the prison doctor from the detention facility in Rostov-on-Don in respect of the quality of the medical care currently afforded to the applicant does not lead it to conclude that the medical care he is continuing to receive in detention is such as to be capable of securing his health and well-being and preventing further aggravation of his condition (see paragraph 49 above). The Court believes that, as a result of the lack of comprehensive and adequate medical treatment, the applicant is being exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering that is diminishing his human dignity.

The courts had examined the possibility of applying other, less strict measures of restraint, such as bail or house arrest, but had found them insufficient to counter-balance the above - mentioned risks.

Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are “relevant and sufficient” reasons justifying his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see Bąk v. Poland, no. 7870/04, § 59, ECHR 2007 II (extracts)).

There was no evidence in the file that he had surrendered his passport.

The Court reiterates that, as regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, the judicial authorities considered that the applicant ’ s substantial influence, including through his holding office in Makhachkala and his links with the law-enforcement bodies, as well as with the criminal underworld, could give him an opportunity to influence witnesses and to destroy evidence if released. In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that the courts could have validly presumed that a risk existed that, if released, the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings, given the nature of his alleged criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, Bąk v.

The Court reiterates the applicant ’ s arguments that the fact that he is seriously ill and confined to a wheelchair, with his state of health continuously deteriorating and the need to remain under constant medical supervision, considerably reduces the risk of his absconding. While not being convinced that the applicant ’ s medical condition entirely mitigated the risk of his absconding so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, the Court is of the opinion that the risk of collusion is such that it cannot be negated by the changes in the applicant ’ s state of health to the extent that his detention is no longer warranted."

Those included the organisation of a terrorist attack on a civilian aircraft and the commissioning of murders of various public officials, including representatives of the law-enforcement bodies who had investigated criminal activities in Makhachkala. The national courts stressed the organised nature of the crimes, involving eleven apprehended defendants and a number of suspects still on the run. Moreover, they could not disregard the fact that the criminal group itself was comprised of public officials and law-enforcement officers. The authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on the parties to the proceedings to be real, and in such circumstances insisted on the necessity to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. The Court reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the witnesses and victims who had already given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses ’ willingness to testify, against the applicant ’ s right to liberty (see Sopin, cited above, § 44)."

The Court believes that the authorities were faced with the difficult task of determining the facts and the degree of responsibility of each of the defendants who had been charged with taking part in the organised criminal acts. In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, coupled with the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the applicant ’ s alleged criminal activities, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for extending the applicant ’ s detention for the time necessary to complete the investigation, draw up a bill of indictment and hear evidence from the accused and witnesses in court. The Court does not underestimate the need for the domestic authorities to take statements from witnesses in a manner that excludes any doubt as to their veracity. The Court thus concludes that, in the circumstances of this case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually did exist, and it justified holding him in custody (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006, and Łaszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 28481/03, §§ 59-60, 15 January 2008). The Court concludes that the circumstances of the case as described in the decisions of the domestic courts, including the applicant ’ s personality and the nature of the crimes with which he was charged, reveal that his detention was based on “relevant” and “sufficient” grounds."

                "112. The Court lastly observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, given the extensive evidentiary proceedings and the implementation of the special measures required in cases concerning organised crime. The time that elapsed between the commission of the crimes and the institution of the criminal proceedings was another factor that complicated the investigators ’ task. The Court is mindful of the fact that the authorities needed to balance the necessity to proceed with the investigation against an obligation to ensure that the applicant was fully fit to take part in it. The national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. They completed the investigation, held the trial hearings and issued the judgment against the applicant within thirteen months. The applicant did not argue that the authorities had, in any way, delayed that procedural action. In these circumstances, the Court reiterates that while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the authorities ’ efforts to clarify fully the facts at issue, to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case, and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed (see, for similar reasoning, Bąk, cited above, § 64)."

There is no information indicating that the applicant refused any treatment before June 2007.

As to the following period, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s medical file and official reports produced by the Government attested that on several occasions the applicant refused “ an examination”, “injections”, and “treatment” (the first such entry in the medical file is dated 15 June 2007). However, those documents did not specify what kind of treatment was offered to the applicant and what examinations he was supposed to undergo. The Court reiterates that the authorities of the penitentiary institution should have kept a record of the applicant ’ s state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 83, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)). Logically, such a medical record should contain sufficient information specifying what kind of treatment the patient was prescribed, what treatment he actually received, who and when administered it, how the applicant ’ s state of health was monitored, etc (see the 3rd General Report of the CPT, quoted in the “Relevant International Instruments” part above). If the applicant ’ s medical file is not specific enough in these respects (as in the case at hand), the Court may make inferences. Furthermore, the Court observes that in September 2007 the investigator recommended that the prison authorities ensure a medical examination of the applicant and the administration of the HAART treatment to him. In the circumstances the Court concludes that, in all probability, the applicant did not receive the HAART treatment from the prison pharmacy."

The Court is aware of the fact that modern anti-retroviral drugs remain very expensive (see, mutatis mutandis, the cases of Karara v. Finland, no. 40900/98, Commission decision of 29 May 1998; see also S .C.C. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 46553/99, 15 February 2000; and Arcila Henao v. The Netherlands (dec.), no. 13669/03, 24 June 2003). The Court refers to its findings in the recent case of N. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 26565/05, § 44, 27 May 2008), where it recognised that “advances in medical science, together with social and economic differences between countries, entail that the level of treatment available in the Contracting State and the country of origin may vary considerably”. That case concerned the provision of free health care to an alien suffering from Aids. In the Court ’ s opinion, broadly the same principle applies in the area of provision of health care to detained nationals : the Contracting States are bound to provide all medical care that their resources might permit."

The applicant did not allege that procuring those medicines imposed an excessive financial burden on him or on his relatives (cf. Mirilashvili v. Russia, (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007, and Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 29 November 2007 ).

The Court accepts that complex medicinal treatment often requires constant supervision by specialist doctors, and taking drugs without such supervision may cause more harm than good. As follows from the official reports produced by the Government, the applicant insisted on his placement in a specialised hospital in order to undergo the HAART treatment.

Remand prison IZ 77/1 had a polyclinic with a facility for in-patient treatment (hereinafter – “the prison hospital”). The prison hospital had 706 beds. It had a surgery department, therapeutic department, a dermatological and venereal department, and an infectious diseases and tuberculosis department. It cooperated with the Moscow State Dentist University and the Third Moscow Medical Institute, which had opened departments specialized in dental surgery and vascular diseases in the prison hospital. The surgical department had 68 beds, including eight in the intensive care unit. The prison hospital accepted patients not only from that prison but also from other prisons. The letters further described the surgical department of the hospital, its facilities and the equipment in the operational and diagnosis rooms. Under an agreement with the Moscow Department of Health, blood analysis for HIV was carried out by specialist clinics outside the prison system."

As early as in September 2006 a medical commission stated that he could be detained only if he received timely and properly supervised specialist medical case for his HIV infection. The applicant alleged that the specialist treatment for HIV/ Aids had not been available in either remand prison 99/1 or remand prison 77/1. In addition, the applicant ’ s eyesight had deteriorated in the remand prison; he had almost lost his sight."

He refused the first blood test only once, on 7 April 2006, on his first day in the remand prison. The applicant had subsequently undergone dozens of various blood tests, the first of which was no later than in August 2006. The applicant never refused “instrumental diagnostics” or examination of the lymph nodes. The Government admitted that under Russian law a refusal to undergo treatment was to be recorded and signed by a detainee; however, the Government failed to produce documents signed by the applicant, in which he allegedly refused treatment. The applicant drew the Court ’ s attention to the fact that the section “List of prescribed treatment” in his prison medical file had been left blank."

Further, the applicant referred to the numerous documents in which the domestic authorities had recognised that HAART treatment had not been administered to him in the remand prison. As he never received the appropriate care in prison, he had developed full-blown Aids and Aids -related lymphoma. The Government ’ s description of the medical facilities available in the prison hospital (dental clinic, operation room, etc. ) was nothing more than a “litany of praises” and was irrelevant to his situation. The prison hospital did not have qualified doctors; the only person who had ever received training in Aids was Dr Molokova. That training consisted of a 72-hour diagnostics course she attended in 2003. As to the photos of the applicant ’ s cell produced by the Government, they were taken on 30 January 2008, after the authorities had undertaken extensive repair works and had equipped the cell with a television, refrigerator and other amenities. Accordingly, the Government ’ s description of conditions of detention in the remand prison did not correspond to reality."

Although his order was later overruled by his superior, neither the investigator nor his superior ever retracted the admission. The applicant noted that in 200 7 the Court, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, had invited the Russian Government to form a bipartisan medical commission in order to examine the applicant ’ s medical condition. However, the State failed to comply with that measure. The applicant invited the Court to draw inferences from that behaviour of the Government and to rely on the findings of the doctors of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital of 21 January 2008, which maintained that his treatment was not compatible with continued detention in the conditions of the remand prison."

His lawyer was allowed to see him only on the eighth day after his transfer. The authorities prohibited family visits, although the court had permitted it. For ten days the applicant was shackled to his bed all day, and even during the night and in the course of medical procedures. For several days the applicant was prohibited from taking a shower although this was necessary for hygienic reasons and, given his immune deficiency, the inability to wash created a serious risk of infection.

Latvia, (no. 4672/02, 2 December 2004), the Court concluded that the detention of a disabled 79- year - old applicant was in breach of Article 3 on account of “ his age, infirmity and health situation ” (see also Papon v.

Thus, in Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, §§ 40-42, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX ) the Court examined such elements of the case as (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of the applicant. This test was further developed in the case of Gelfmann v. France (no. 25875/03, 14 December 2004), where the Court took into account, among other relevant factors, the dynamics of the applicant ’ s health condition, the possibility of conditional release or parole for a seriously ill detainee if his health deteriorated, and the applicant ’ s own attitude ( namely his persistent refusal to cooperate with the doctors ). In the cases of Henaf v. France (no. 65436/01, §§ 49 et seq., ECHR 2003 ‑ XI) and Mousiel v. France (cited above) the Court also analysed whether the application of handcuffs or shackling of a seriously ill detainee to his bed was justified by any security risks. The applicant ’ s potential “dangerousness” was also taken into account in the case of Sakkopoulos v. Greece (no. 61828/00, § 44, 15 January 2004) in order to decide whether his continuous detention on remand was justified."

The Court reiterates in this respect that even if Article 3 does not entitle a detainee to be released “on compassionate grounds”, it always requires that the health and well-being of detainees are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; see also Hurtado v. Switzerland, 28 January 1994, § 79, Series A no. 280-A, opinion of the Commission; Kalashnikov v.

The CPT proclaimed the principle of the equivalence of health care in prison with that in the outside community (see “Relevant International Instruments” above ). However, the Court does not always adhere to this standard, at least when it comes to medical assistance to convicted prisoners (as opposed to those detained on remand). On several occasions the Court has held that Article 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as securing to every detained person medical assistance of the same level as “ in the best civilian clinics ” (see the case of Mirilashivili v. Russia (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007 ). In the case of Grishin v. Russia the Court went further, holding that it was “prepared to accept that in principle the resources of medical facilities within the penitentiary system are limited compared to those of civil [ian] clinics” ( no. 30983/02, § 76, 15 November 2007)."

Indeed, that applicant had lost almost all of the sight in his left eye, whereas he was already blind in the right eye at the moment of his arrest. However, having examined the materials in its possession, the Court is unable to conclude that the deterioration of the applicant ’ s eyesight was imputable to the authorities, or that his poor eyesight as such was incompatible with his detention from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention."

First, it is clear that the applicant was and remains seriously ill, that he is suffering from advanced Aids, and that in 2006–2008 he developed a number of opportunistic infections and lymph cancer.

                "147. As to the following period, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s medical file and official reports produced by the Government attested that on several occasions the applicant refused “ an examination”, “injections”, and “treatment” (the first such entry in the medical file is dated 15 June 2007). However, those documents did not specify what kind of treatment was offered to the applicant and what examinations he was supposed to undergo. The Court reiterates that the authorities of the penitentiary institution should have kept a record of the applicant ’ s state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 83, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)). Logically, such a medical record should contain sufficient information specifying what kind of treatment the patient was prescribed, what treatment he actually received, who and when administered it, how the applicant ’ s state of health was monitored, etc (see the 3rd General Report of the CPT, quoted in the “Relevant International Instruments” part above). If the applicant ’ s medical file is not specific enough in these respects (as in the case at hand), the Court may make inferences. Furthermore, the Court observes that in September 2007 the investigator recommended that the prison authorities ensure a medical examination of the applicant and the administration of the HAART treatment to him. In the circumstances the Court concludes that, in all probability, the applicant did not receive the HAART treatment from the prison pharmacy."

First of all, the Court does not consider that in the circumstances the authorities were under an unqualified obligation to administer the HAART treatment to the applicant free of charge. The Court is aware of the fact that modern anti-retroviral drugs remain very expensive (see, mutatis mutandis, the cases of Karara v. Finland, no. 40900/98, Commission decision of 29 May 1998; see also S .C.C. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 46553/99, 15 February 2000; and Arcila Henao v. The Netherlands (dec.), no. 13669/03, 24 June 2003). The Court refers to its findings in the recent case of N. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 26565/05, § 44, 27 May 2008), where it recognised that “advances in medical science, together with social and economic differences between countries, entail that the level of treatment available in the Contracting State and the country of origin may vary considerably”. That case concerned the provision of free health care to an alien suffering from Aids. In the Court ’ s opinion, broadly the same principle applies in the area of provision of health care to detained nationals : the Contracting States are bound to provide all medical care that their resources might permit."

                "149. Secondly, as follows from the applicant ’ s medical file, he did not depend on the pharmacy ’ s stock and could receive necessary medication from his relatives. The applicant did not allege that procuring those medicines imposed an excessive financial burden on him or on his relatives (cf. Mirilashvili v. Russia, (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007, and Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 29 November 2007 ).

The Court accepts that complex medicinal treatment often requires constant supervision by specialist doctors, and taking drugs without such supervision may cause more harm than good. As follows from the official reports produced by the Government, the applicant insisted on his placement in a specialised hospital in order to undergo the HAART treatment.

From the Government ’ s submissions it follows that the prison hospital was equipped and staffed to treat a broad range of illnesses, in particular those prevalent in the Russian prison system, such as tuberculosis. However, it is clear that the prison hospital did not have a department specialised in the treatment of Aids. The Court notes that one of the doctors in the prison hospital had undergone training in HIV diagnostics. However, there is no evidence that that training included anti-retroviral therapy.

According to Decree no. 170 of the Ministry of Health (see the “Relevant Domestic Law” part above), if there was no specialised clinic available, a patient suffering from Aids could be placed in an infectious diseases hospital. The text of the Decree shows that even in domestic terms an infectious diseases hospital is not regarded as a “specialised clinic” for the treatment of Aids : it is a substitute where no specialised clinic is available."

Five days later the investigator in charge of the applicant ’ s case decided that the applicant ’ s diseases could not be treated in the conditions of the remand prison and asked the court to release the applicant on bail. However, ten days later the investigator changed his mind and refused the application for release on bail. The applicant ’ s medical file does not contain any evidence that between 31 October and 9 November 2007 the applicant underwent any new medical examination which would rebut the conclusions of the earlier report.

The Court admits that in certain circumstances the refusal to undergo examination or treatment may suggest that the applicant ’ s state of health is not as critical as he claims (see Gelfmann v. France, cited above, § 56). However, in the circumstances of the present case the applicant ’ s attitude was understandable. Notwithstanding a serious deterioration in the applicant ’ s health, and despite the specialist doctors ’ clear recommendation that he should be transferred to an outside specialised clinic, he remained in the prison hospital. Furthermore, the prison doctors attested that the applicant was fit to support the continuing detention and could participate in the criminal proceedings (see the court ’ s ruling of 15 November 2007), despite the fact that (a) the most recent medical examination had reached the opposite conclusion, and (b) since then the applicant had not undergone any new comprehensive examination, for whatever reason."

It indicated, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the Government and the applicant should form a bi-partisan medical commission which would answer a number of questions, formulated by the Court. The Government replied that the creation of such commissions would be contrary to the domestic legislation. However, they did not refer to any law which would prevent the examination of a patient by a mixed medical commission, to include doctors of his choice. The Court further observes that the applicant ’ s health was examined on several occasions by mixed commissions made up of doctors from various clinics. In any event, the State “should not deny the possibility to receive medical assistance from other sources, such as the detainee ’ s family doctor or other qualified doctors” (see Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 82, 4 October 2005 ). In the circumstances the Court considers that the Government ’ s refusal to form a mixed medical commission was arbitrary.

Thus, the Moscow AIDS Centre (a clinic which would most probably have been the applicant ’ s destination in the event of his transfer from the prison hospital ) was located in the same city, and it was prepared to accept the applicant for in-patient treatment. It appears that the applicant was able to assume most of the expenses related to the treatment. Furthermore, in view of the applicant ’ s state of health and his previous conduct, the Court considers that the security risks he might have presented at that time, if any, were negligible compared to the health risks he faced (see Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, §§ 47, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX ). In any event, the security arrangements made by the prison authorities in Hospital no. 60 did not appear very complicated."

This undermined his dignity and entailed particularly acute hardship, causing suffering beyond that inevitably associated with a prison sentence and the illnesses he suffered from, which amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.

                "160. The Government claimed that the applicant ’ s detention had been lawful and justified. As regards a possible liberation on health grounds, they maintained that the Decree of 6 February 2004, referred to by the defence, did not apply to the applicant ’ s situation. That Decree established the list of diseases which could justify the conditional release of a convict from serving a prison sentence. The applicant, however, had not been yet convicted. Therefore, at that stage the Decree was not applicable to him. Further, his doctors had always confirmed that the applicant was fit to participate in the investigative actions and the court hearings."
            ],
            [
                "161. The Government claimed that the applicant was taken into custody on the basis of a “reasonable suspicion” against him. They referred to the testimonies and documents in the case file which, in their view, justified that suspicion. They further noted that the applicant ’ s prosecution was authorised by a ruling of the judge of the Simonovskiy District Court of 6 April 2006, as provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure."
            ],
            [
                "162. As to the decision to extend the applicant ’ s detention on remand, it was taken on the basis of information received by the prosecution from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to that information, received as a result of operational and search activities, the applicant planned to leave Russia. That information was referred to by the prosecution in support of their request of 2 June 2006 to extend the detention on remand. At the hearing of 2 June 2006 the defence claimed, in substance, that the information had been obtained unlawfully. However, the court was precluded from examining that aspect of the case. Had it been otherwise the court would have had to evaluate evidence and decide on the applicant ’ s guilt, which was not its task at that stage of the proceedings. Instead, the district court indicated that the defence could challenge the decision to begin operational and search activities within separate proceedings. The applicant, as a professional lawyer, should have been aware of that legal avenue available to him."
            ],
            [
                "163. The Government claimed that the applicant ’ s continuous detention was justified by the “gravity of the charges, the applicant ’ s personality and profession, taking into account information available to the Russian courts, and given that there were sufficient reasons to believe that, if released, the applicant could abscond from the investigative authorities and the court, would interfere with the course of justice by taking steps aimed at destroying evidence, would put pressure on witnesses and victims, [and] would contact other accused who were hiding from justice”. Those conclusions were made on the basis of the following information:",
                "- a communication received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the applicant ’ s plans to leave Russia;",
                "- statements by a number of witnesses, including the applicant ’ s co-defendants;",
                "- the testimony of witness Ms M., who represented the interests of one of the shareholders of the company “ Tomskneft VNK ”. She explained that the applicant had threatened her in connection with her professional activities, which were intended to protect the interests of minority shareholders in “Yukos”.",
                "The domestic courts also assessed other factors, such as the applicant ’ s age, health and family situation. However, these considerations were outweighed by the other information about the applicant, which led the courts at two instances to conclude that the applicant should be detained."
            ],
            [
                "164. The Government claimed that the length of detention on remand did not exceed the time strictly necessary to conduct the investigation. The pre-trial investigation was carried out with “special diligence”, without delays or “red-tape ”. The applicant ’ s case was of outstanding complexity. A lot of time was spent on locating and seizing the necessary documentary evidence and in identifying experts in various fields, who had then to examine a great number of financial and economic documents. A large number of witnesses had to be questioned."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Government further maintained that the applicant had never complained before the courts of appeal about a lack of special diligence. Neither had he lodged a civil claim against the prosecution authorities seeking damages for the delays in the proceedings. The Government referred to Article 1069 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, which provides for compensation for non-pecuniary damage in cases of unlawful acts or inactivity of State authorities."
            ],
            [
                "166. The Government further claimed that the defence enjoyed all procedural guarantees during the detention hearings. The Government referred to the records of the respective detention hearings. The court of appeal had examined all substantive aspects relevant to the lawfulness of the applicant ’ s detention. The Government reiterated that the Russian courts were precluded from examining the evidence relied on by the prosecution because it would be tantamount to establishing the applicant ’ s guilt or innocence."
            ],
            [
                "167. As to the decision of 2 November 2007, the Government claimed that the domestic courts did not have the power to release the applicant. Under Article 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court has the power to apply the following measures of restraint: custody, house arrest, and bail. Milder measures of restraint (such as an undertaking not to leave the place of residence) are imposed by a simple decision of the investigator, or by the court. However, if a measure of restraint was applied by a joint decision of the investigator and the prosecutor, it could be lifted only if both agreed. Since the prosecutor had opposed the release of the applicant at the hearing, the court maintained the detention order.",

            ],
            [
                "168. The applicant maintained that his detention was incompatible with Russian law. He suffered from at least three medical conditions which precluded incarceration under the “List of Ailments Precluding Punishment ” (see the “Relevant Domestic Law” part above). The Government ’ s argument that the legislation at issue was only applicable to convicted criminals was contrary to common sense. As the Constitutional Court of Russia had held in one of its cases, the domestic courts, in deciding on whether to place a criminal suspect in detention on remand, should do so only if the person faced a real prospect of punishment if convicted. Thus, remanding in custody somebody who was due to be released after conviction was senseless. The applicant further claimed that his detention after 2 March 2008 had been unlawful. The last extension of his detention, imposed on 6 February 2008, had expired on 2 March 2008. On that date he submitted a request to the prison warden seeking his immediate release, but this was refused."
            ],
            [
                "169. Further, the applicant claimed that there was no “reasonable suspicion” against him that would warrant his detention. The applicant lacked legal capacity to commit the first offence imputed to him. As to the second offence, it was imputed to the applicant only several years after it had allegedly been committed. The charges against the applicant arose from an investigation which had been ongoing for over six years. In any event, the courts had never examined the evidence against him, but merely reproduced the account given in the prosecution ’ s request for detention. Under the relevant provisions of the Russian Code on Criminal Procedure, the courts are not required to consider whether there are any facts or evidence giving rise to a “reasonable suspicion” that the accused has committed an offence."
            ],
            [
                "170. The applicant further argued that even if the account proposed by the prosecution was accepted, the facts referred to in their request for detention would not satisfy a “reasonable observer” that the applicant had been involved in the imputed offences."
            ],
            [
                "171. The applicant claimed that his detention was not in compliance with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, in that the grounds for his detention adduced by the domestic courts were abstract and stereotyped, were based on unsubstantiated allegations, were outweighed by compelling evidence against detention, and that no alternative detention had been considered. The applicant had always cooperated with the investigative authorities and arrived at the court when summoned; the police had failed to identify or produce the report which allegedly confirmed the applicant ’ s intention to leave Russia."
            ],
            [
                "172. The applicant also noted that Russian law established maximum time-limits for detention pending investigation, but not for detention during the time when the accused could study the case file. The case was ready for trial in December 2006; however, the applicant was almost blind, so the investigator had to read him the case file. From October 2007 the applicant ’ s health deteriorated to the extent that the applicant was essentially unable to continue working with the case file. As a result, the applicant was trapped in a “statutory loophole” that permitted his detention to be extended repeatedly without limit."
            ],
            [
                "173. Under Article 5 § 4, the applicant complained that the courts did not review the lawfulness of his detention. The Government admitted that the CCrP prohibited the courts from undertaking any examination of the merits or admissibility of the evidence. Furthermore, according to the applicant, in the period between the court orders extending his remand, he did not have a judicial remedy by which the lawfulness of his detention could be decided. When the applicant ’ s health took a sharp turn for the worse in October 2007, the court held that the question of the applicant ’ s release was subject to the sole discretion of the investigator."
            ],
            [
                "174. Finally, the applicant claimed that the deprivation of his liberty had been applied for reasons alien to Article 5, and that Article 18 had thus been violated. He claimed that the State authorities had arrested him in order to prevent the lawful management of Yukos from regaining control of the company. Subsequently, the authorities tried to pressure the applicant into giving false statements against other senior managers in that company."
            ],
            [
                "175. The Court considers, in the light of the parties ’ submissions, that the complaint raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes therefore that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established."
            ],
            [
                "176. The Court notes that in his original application and subsequent observations the applicant claimed that his detention had been contrary to Article 5 of the Convention under several heads: it was unlawful, unjustified, and lasted too long. Having examined his arguments, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine all of them; instead, the Court will concentrate on his third allegation, namely that his continuous detention exceeded the “reasonable time” requirement of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "177. The Court reiterates that the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in abstracto. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are “relevant and sufficient” reasons to justify the continued detention (see, as a classic authority, Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, § 12, Series A no. 7, and Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, § 52, Series A no. 319 ‑ A ). The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the detention to be lawful under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention (see, among many authorities, W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, § 30, Series A no. 254 ‑ A ). However, after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty."
            ],
            [
                "178. The Convention case-law has developed four basic acceptable reasons for refusing bail: the risk that the accused will fail to appear for trial (see Stögmüller v. Austria, 10 November 1969, § 15, Series A no. 9); the risk that the accused, if released, would take action to prejudice the administration of justice (see Wemhoff, cited above, § 14) or commit further offences (see Matznetter v. Austria, 10 November 1969, § 9, Series A no. 10) or cause public disorder (see Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, § 51, Series A no. 207)."
            ],
            [
                "179. Further, the Court has reiterated that shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in matters of detention is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, § 67, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions. Arguments for and against release must not be “general and abstract” (see Clooth v. Belgium, 12 December 1991, § 44, Series A no. 225), but contain references to the specific facts and the applicant ’ s personal circumstances justifying his detention (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, § 107, 8 February 2005)."

                "180. Finally, the Court emphasises that when deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities have an obligation under Article 5 § 3 to consider alternative measures to ensure his or her appearance at the trial (see Sulaoja v. Estonia, no. 55939/00, § 64, 15 February 2005, and Jabłoński v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 83, 21 December 2000).",

Therefore, the period to be taken into consideration has lasted two years and eight months. Such a length of pre-trial detention is a matter of concern for the Court (see Govorushko v. Russia, no. 42940/06, § 45, 25 October 2007). The Court reiterates that the Russian authorities were required to put forward very weighty reasons for keeping the applicant in detention for such a long time (see Korchuganova v. Russia, no. 75039/01, § 71, 8 June 2006)."

The Court notes that the applicant ’ s detention could initially have been justified by two reasons: the risk of interference with the course of justice, and the risk that the applicant might abscond. As from 23 August 2006 the courts also referred to the risk of reoffending. The Court reiterates in this respect that the authorities cannot justify the continuing detention by a mere reference to such risks; they must refer to specific facts about the applicant ’ s behaviour, his personal circumstances, etc (see Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, § 108, 12 June 2008)."

G. entitled “Summary analysis ... ”; and ( h ), the circumstances in which the applicant had been arrested. In addition, the Government in their observations referred to the statements by unidentified witnesses, and by Ms M., who, according to the Government, had received threats from the applicant in the past. However, the Court observes that these statements were not referred to by the domestic courts. The Court reiterates that it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts ’ decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova, cited above, § 72; Ilijkov, cited above, § 86; and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ).

            [
                "184. At the outset, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not make an attempt to link any of the above facts with the specific risks they were using to justify detenion. Thus, the Court does not see how any of the facts could have proved the risk of re-offending, to which the authorities referred as from 23 August 2006. The Court points out that the charges against the applicant concerned the period of 1998-1999 (misappropriation of shares) and 2000-2002 (personal income - tax evasion). Given that the acts imputed to the applicant had allegedly been committed by him in his capacity as head of the legal department of Yukos, a post which he had occupied until 2003, it is dubious that the applicant would still have been able to continue his alleged criminal activity in 2006 - 2007, and especially after 29 March 200 6, when an interim receiver was appointed by the court to administer Yukos within the framework of the bankruptcy proceedings."

In support of that finding the courts referred, first, to the severity of the sentence faced. The Court accepts that it is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention or to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko v. Russia, cited above, § 102; Goral v. Poland, no. 38654/97, § 68, 30 October 2003; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § 101, 1 March 2007 )."

As to the applicant ’ s professional status, even assuming that it was a relevant consideration, the Court notes that it had been known to the authorities from the very beginning of the investigation in 2004.

He was not formally required to remain in his own flat at all times, or even to inform the authorities of his whereabouts. The same concerns his absence from the court hearing of 6 April 2006, at which only his lawyer was present.

However, the Court is prepared to admit that the combination of the above arguments could justify the applicant ’ s initial arrest and his detention for some time, at least on an arguable basis.

In this respect the Court notes that the investigation in the applicant ’ s case was terminated on 12 December 2006. Therefore, by the end of 2006 all witnesses had been questioned, all materials collected and expert examinations conducted. Furthermore, after 29 March 2006 the company was under the control of the interim receiver, and, after 4 August 2006, that of the bankruptcy trustee, with whom the applicant had no relations whatsoever.

On 15 September 2006 the applicant was found to be HIV-positive. On 22 November 2006 the doctors noted that the applicant ’ s condition was worsening, and recommended HAART treatment for him. The Court reiterates its findings under Article 3 of the Convention, namely that this treatment required constant medical supervision in a specialist clinic, and that without such treatment the applicant ’ s health and even life were at serious risk.

In that case the Court held that “the domestic authorities did not explain why the withdrawal of his Russian travel passport, a measure explicitly envisaged in domestic law for removing flight risks, would not have been sufficient to prevent him from absconding abroad. ” That conclusion, made in respect of a foreign national, is a fortiori applicable in the circumstances of the present case where the applicant was a Russian national, and had well-established ties in the country (he was the sole custodial parent of a minor son)."

He has already spent more than 34 months in detention. Some of the applicant ’ s illnesses are incurable. It appears that the prospects of any treatment he receives or may receive are uncertain.

Therefore the searching of lawyers ’ premises should be subject to especially strict scrutiny ( see Elci and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, § 669, 13 November 2003). To determine whether these measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has to explore the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law and check how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer – or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny –, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and – where a lawyer ’ s office is concerned – whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Camenzind v. Switzerland, 16 December 1997, § 45, Reports 1997-VIII; Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, § 45, ECHR 2005-IV; Smirnov v.

The Court accepts that the domestic judge, while examining the request, was satisfied that there was reasonable ground for suspecting that the commission of a fraud had occurred and that evidence might be found at the premises to be searched (see Tamosius v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62002/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII )."

                "216. However, in the opinion of the Court, the search warrants at issue were formulated in excessively broad terms. They allowed the prosecution authorities to search for “ documents and objects important for the investigation”. Such wording gave the prosecution unrestricted discretion in determining which documents were “of interest” for the criminal investigation. The Court recalls that in the case of Smirnov v. Russia, cited above, the vagueness of the search warrant was the key element which led the Court to conclude that the search in the lawyer ’ s flat had been incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention. The Court came to the same conclusions in the case of Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria ( no. 65755/01, § § 34 et seq., 22 May 2008 ), where the domestic authorities searched the office of a lawyer suspected of kidnapping and extortion. In that case the Court held that “neither the application for its issue [of the warrant] nor the warrant itself specified what items and documents were expected to be found in the applicant ’ s office, or how they would be relevant to the investigation. Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch at all upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be removed”. The same characteristics can be found in the present case. The search warrants delivered by the Simonovskiy District Court on 4 and 5 April 2006 gave the authorities unfettered discretion in deciding what documents to seize, and did not contain any reservation in respect of privileged documents, although the authorities knew that the applicant was a Bar Member and could have possessed documents conferred to him by his clients."

Bulgaria, cited above, § 41). However, the Court notes that by the time of the searches the official investigation into the business activities of the Yukos management had been going on for almost three years. From the very beginning of the investigation the authorities should have known that the applicant had been head of the legal department of Yukos in 1998– 1999, when the crimes were allegedly committed, and could have had in his possession certain documents, electronic data and other evidence pertinent to the events at issue.

The Court, in view of the critical state of the applicant ’ s health, invited the Government to transfer him to a specialist medical institution. However, it was not until 8 February that the applicant was transferred to Hospital no. 60. The Court leaves open the question whether Hospital no. 60 can be considered a “specialist institution” in view of the recent developments in the applicant ’ s medical condition. What is clear is that for over two months the Government continuously refused to implement the interim measure, thus putting the applicant ’ s health and even life in danger. The Government did not suggest that the measure indicated under Rule 39 was practically unfeasible; on the contrary, the applicant ’ s subsequent transfer to Hospital no. 60 shows that this measure was relatively easy to implement.

The Court recalls that in its analysis under Article 3 of the Convention it found that the Government ’ s justification of their refusal to allow such examination was not satisfactory (see paragraph 155 above). Bearing in mind that the applicant is seriously ill, was detained, and was therefore unable to collect all necessary information himself, the Court considers that such a position on the part of the authorities amounts, in the circumstances, to an attempt to hinder the applicant in pursuing his application under Article 34 of the Convention. The fact that the Court found itself in a position to decide the case on the basis of the information available to it does not, in the circumstances, affect this conclusion (see the case-law cited above, in particular the case of Olaechea Cahuas v.

In the present case, it has not been claimed that the applicant contracted HIV or that he had been unlawfully exposed to a real risk of infection, for instance, through sexual contact or intravenous drug use. The applicant did not dispute that the colony administration had taken necessary steps to prevent sexual contact between inmates and that it had forbidden drug use and tattooing. The Court also does not overlook the fact that the colony administration employed a harm-reduction technique, namely condom distribution, together with universal precaution policies such as sterilising medical equipment for each patient. The mere fact that HIV-positive detainees use the same medical, sanitary, catering and other facilities as all other prisoners does not in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Korobov and Others v. Russia (dec.), no. 67086/01, 2 March 2006). The administration provided inmates with accurate and objective information about HIV infection and AIDS, clearly identifying ways in which HIV can be transmitted. The Court attributes particular importance to the HIV risk-reduction counselling which was performed by the colony administration (see, by contrast, Salmanov v. Russia, no. 3522/04, § 53, 31 July 2008 ). In these circumstances the Court does not find that the authorities failed to secure the applicant's health."

In such circumstances, the cells in fact occasionally accommodated more inmates than was permitted, however the [permitted] number was not exceeded threefold as [the applicant] claimed.

The [District] Court lawfully found that there were no grounds for accepting [the applicant's] action for compensation for non-pecuniary damage as the responsibility under Article 1069 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation only arises on the condition of guilt on the part of the State authorities, which is absent in the present case.",

At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years.",

Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee's delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2).",

At Colony No 8, the supervising prosecutor indicated that, during his inspections, he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private “because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony's administration”.",

It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the Court and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Varnava and Others v.

                "(a) if such an action is considered a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, in which case the six-month period provided for in that Article should be calculated from the date of the final decisions by the Kaliningrad Regional Court; or",
                "(b) if such a judicial avenue is not considered to provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress, when the Court finds that the applicant, unaware of circumstances which rendered the remedy ineffective, still complied with the six-month rule for the purpose of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention by availing himself of that apparently existing remedy.",

                "110. As to the effectiveness of the remedy, the Court reiterates that in other relevant cases regarding the conditions of detention it has found that the Russian Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant's detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant's personal situation alone (see, for example, Buzychkin v. Russia, no. 68337/01, § 49, 14 October 2008, Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004, and Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, 18 September 2001). At the same time, the Court observes that it has jurisdiction in every case to assess in the light of the particular facts whether any given remedy appears to offer the possibility of effective and sufficient redress within the meaning of the generally recognised rules of international law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Denisov v. Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004). Thus, without prejudice to its findings in earlier similar cases, the Court may examine whether in the particular circumstances of the present case an action for damages could have been regarded as an effective remedy for the purpose of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "111. In the light of the information before it, the Court observes that Article 1069 of the Russian Civil Code provides for compensation for any unlawful act or omission by State authorities (see paragraph 88 above) which could in principle provide a remedy in respect of the applicant's allegations of appalling conditions of his detention. However, in the instant case, having established, among other things, that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells, the domestic courts dismissed his action and refused compensation on the sole ground that the domestic authorities, in particular, the facility administration, had not been liable for damage arising out of the conditions of his detention (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). The courts'finding was apparently based on the underlying proposition that the authorities were only accountable for damage caused by culpable conduct or omission. In the particular case, they considered that the lack of financial resources excluded the liability of the domestic authorities for unsatisfactory conditions of the applicant's detention, which were amply proven. They did not consider that it was not open to the State authorities to cite lack of funds or limited capacity of the detention facility as an excuse for not honouring their obligation to ensure satisfactory conditions of detention."

Bearing in mind the Government's argument that the problem of overcrowding in Russian detention facilities is derived from, inter alia, the lack of financial resources (see paragraph 102 above) which rendered the overcrowding a structural problem, and having regard to the subject matter of the applicant's claim, the approach adopted by the Russian courts is unacceptable. It allows a large number of cases, such as the applicant's, where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention result from lack of funds or limited capacity of detention facilities, to be dismissed. Thus, as a result of that stance of the courts, the remedy under the Russian Civil Code offers no prospect of success and could be considered theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective in the sense of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court is not satisfied that in the present state of the Russian law of tort claimants could reasonably expect to recover damages on proof of their allegations unless there were to be a change or at least a material development in the existing interpretation of the domestic legal provisions on tort by the Russian courts (see Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § § 82-91, 12 March 2009 ).",

On 6 February 2002, that is more than sixteen months later, he introduced his application to the Court. In June 2002 the applicant lodged his first action with the Tsentralniy District Court seeking compensation for damage arising out of the conditions of his detention during the first period from 16 August 1998 to 14 April 1999. In June 2003 he brought another action complaining about the conditions of detention during the second period, which had ended on 26 September 2000."

It is apparent that since August 1998, when the applicant found himself for the first time in the allegedly unsatisfactory conditions of detention, at least in theory an action lay under the Russian Civil Code for compensation for damages for pain and suffering experienced by him during his detention. However, it was not until June 2002 that he made use of that judicial avenue for the first time. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the second action was only brought a year later. The lapse of time in this case is striking. As stated above, the six - month rule enshrines the basic principle that complaints of breaches of Convention rights be brought with the expedition necessary to ensure effective and fair examination of the case. There are no exceptions and no possibility of waiver. The Court has held on a number of occasions that applicants must act with reasonable expedition in bringing their cases before it for examination and have sufficient explanation, consonant with the purpose of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention and the effective implementation of the Convention guarantees, for long periods of delay."

In the circumstances of the present case the Court sees no reason which could have forced the applicant to choose to wait for so long before applying to a domestic court, save for his own belief that such an action would be meaningless. It appears that he only decided to sue the detention facility after he had received the first letter from the Court by which he had been notified of the admissibility criteria as set out in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention and informed that the six-month period for the purpose of Article 35 § 1 runs from the date of the final decision by a domestic authority.

The complaints to the Court should therefore have been introduced no later than 14 October 1999, in respect of the first period of detention, and no later than 26 March 2001 in respect of the second period of detention (see Laçin v.

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII)."

Germany, 22 September 1993, § 29, Series A no. 269). Although the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Matko v. Slovenia, no. 43393/98, § 100, 2 November 2006).

According to that certificate, the applicant had an abrasion on the side of his back (see paragraph 44 above). The Court reiterates the applicant's explanation that he was not examined by a prison doctor immediately after the alleged beatings, despite his numerous requests to that effect. He also pointed out that during the examination on 7 November 2001, that is two weeks after the alleged beatings, the prison doctor had refused to record all injuries. In response to the applicant's allegations, the Government submitted that a doctor had been present at the scene when the officers had carried out their operations and that he had not recorded any complaints (see paragraph 41 above)."

From materials available to the Court it appears that the applicant was one of a number of detainees who complained about having been beaten on 23 October 2001 (see paragraph 55 above). The Court has already held in a number of cases that in such circumstances the State authorities were under an obligation to conduct a medical examination of the applicant as well as of other detainees held in the premises concerned (see Mironov v. Russia, no. 22625/02, § 57, 8 November 2007, with further references). Although the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant's ill-treatment complaints will be examined below, the Court would already stress at this juncture that it is struck by the fact that, despite the seriousness of the applicant's allegations, no medical examination was performed in the present case. The examination on 7 November 2001 does not suffice to discharge this obligation because of the time that elapsed between the events complained of and the date when it was conducted. The Court is also mindful of the District Court's decision of 29 March 2006 by which an investigation into the applicant's ill-treatment complaints was reopened. In that decision the District Court noted that an independent medical examination was indispensible for an investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraph 59 above)."

It is not surprising that the applicant did not raise his grievances to the prison doctor while still in the presence of the alleged offenders. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that the applicant felt intimidated by the persons he had accused of having ill-treated him (see Colibaba v. Moldova, no. 29089/06, § 49, 23 October 2007 and Batı and Others v. Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/0 0, § 100, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV (extracts)).

Were it otherwise, the authorities would be able to avoid responsibility for ill-treatment by not conducting medical examinations and not recording the use of physical force or special means (see, mutatis mutandis, Dedovskiy and Others v.

The Court notes that on 26 October 2001 the prison doctor had ordered the applicant's confinement to bed for three days, making an entry to that effect in register no. 29 of the penal ward (see paragraph 39 above). This fact was not disputed by the Government. It was also confirmed by the finding of the Bagrationovskiy District Court in the proceedings pertaining to the applicant's civil suit (see paragraph 63 above). The Court does not lose sight of the fact that at the hearing before the District Court the prison doctor insisted that the confinement was ordered because the applicant was tired. However, the Court finds this explanation to be superficial and concocted. Furthermore, at the hearing on 26 April 2004 before the Bagrationovskiy District Court a representative of the correctional colony stated that on 23 October 2001 physical force had been used on the applicant and that he had been hit with a rubber truncheon (see paragraph 63 above). The fact of the beating was also confirmed in open court by the applicant's fellow inmate, Mr T. The Court therefore finds it established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the applicant was hit at least once with a rubber truncheon by the officers of the special-purpose unit."

The Court further notes that in order to be able to assess the merits of the applicant's ill-treatment complaint and in view of the nature of the allegations, it asked the Government to submit a copy of the complete investigation file relating to the proceedings against the officers of the special-purpose unit. The Government, without giving any reasons, failed to provide the Court with the materials sought, limiting themselves to submitting copies of certain reports and decisions of domestic authorities which were already in the Court's possession. In these circumstances, the Court is prepared to draw inferences from the Government's conduct, as well as from the failure of the domestic authorities to carry out a medical examination of the applicant in the aftermath of the events on 23 October 2001. Having said that and taking into account the evidence examined in the preceding paragraph together with the consistency of the allegations of ill-treatment which the applicant maintained whenever he was able to make statements freely before various investigating authorities or domestic courts, the Court finds it established to the standard of proof required in the Convention proceedings that on 23 October 2001 the applicant was subjected to the treatment of which he complained and for which the Government bore responsibility (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 88, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Mehmet Emin Yüksel v. Turkey, no. 40154/98, § 30, 20 July 2004; and Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, §§ 104-105, 26 January 2006).

The Court does not discern any circumstance which might have necessitated the use of violence against the applicant. In this connection, the Court reiterates the Government's argument that the use of force was not necessary as the detainees, including the applicant, fully complied with orders. It thus appears that the use of force was intentional, retaliatory in nature and aimed at debasing the applicant and forcing him into submission.

The force did not exceed what was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances of the case. As it follows from the report written by the warder L., when the applicant had tried to run in the corridor, he had gripped his arm and “using a fight method” had put the applicant on the floor (see paragraph 43 above). The applicant did not dispute that he had run in the corridor and had disobeyed the order. However, he submitted that officer L. had repeatedly hit and kicked him in the hips and face.

However, given the Court's findings in respect of the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment which had occurred on 23 October 2001 (see paragraph 156 above), it is not possible for the Court to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the injury described by the prison doctor was caused by the warder L. on 7 November 2001."

It is consistent with a minor physical confrontation which might have occurred between the applicant and the warder. The Court also cannot overlook the inconsistencies in the applicant's versions of events as recounted before the domestic authorities and to the Court. Furthermore, the Court finds it peculiar that none of the applicant's fellow inmates testified to seeing marks on the applicant's face, although the latter insisted that the warder had hit him with the fist in the face a number of times. The Court therefore concludes that nothing shows that the warder had used excessive force when in the course of his duties he had been confronted with the alleged disorderly behaviour of the applicant. The Court is not persuaded that the force used had such an impact on the applicant's physical or mental well-being as to give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention."

In particular, the Court once again notes the indiscriminate nature of the special purpose unit's operations which targeted the entire colony population rather than specific detainees and the authorities'failure to conduct a medical examination to ascertain whether the applicant sustained any injuries as a result of the operations in the colony, which is particularly striking in the situation where the domestic authorities as well as the Government confirmed that the applicant had been beaten."

An obligation to investigate “is not an obligation of result, but of means ”: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant's account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill ‑ treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on.

The prosecutor had the legal powers to interview the warders and officers, summon witnesses, visit the scene of the incidents, collect forensic evidence and take all other crucial steps for establishing the truth of the applicant's account. His role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the offence but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had suffered (see paragraph 86 above). The Court notes that the prosecution authorities who were made aware of the applicant's alleged beatings initiated an investigation which has not yet resulted in criminal prosecutions against the perpetrators of the beatings. The investigation was closed and reopened a number of times and is currently pending. In the Court's opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there has been an investigation, since the parties do not dispute that there has been one, as whether it has been conducted diligently, whether the authorities have been determined to identify and prosecute those responsible and, accordingly, whether the investigation has been “effective”."

In the present case the applicant brought his allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities by making a number of complaints to the Kaliningrad Regional Prosecutor (see paragraph 48 above). It appears that the prosecutor's office promptly launched an investigation after being notified of the alleged beatings. However, the Court is mindful of the fact that at no point during the investigation were attempts made to conduct a medical expert examination of the applicant. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akkoç v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, § 55 and § 118, ECHR 2000 ‑ X ).

Since being reopened in March 2006 the investigation has remained pending. The Government failed to provide any explanation for the protraction of the proceedings.

He limited himself to a restatement of their reports written in the aftermath of the events. The applicant's right to participate effectively in the investigation was also not secured.

Although excerpts from the applicant's complaints were included in the decisions on refusal to institute criminal proceedings, the prosecutor did not consider those complaints to be credible, apparently because they reflected personal opinions and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the prosecutor did accept the warders'and officers'reports as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant's credibility. In the Court's view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the statements, as those made by the applicant were deemed to be subjective but not those given by the warders and officers. The credibility of the latter statements should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether they were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.

The prosecutor had been provided with the names of inmates who could have seen the beatings. However, he had not taken any steps to question them or to identify any other eyewitnesses. Furthermore, he took no meaningful steps to search the premises where the applicant had allegedly been ill-treated. The Court therefore finds that the prosecutor's failure to look for corroborating evidence and his deferential attitude to the officers and warders must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Aydın v.

Bulgaria, no. 43233/98, § 75, 16 February 2006). For the Court, this unexplained shortcoming in the proceedings deprived the applicant of an opportunity to challenge effectively the alleged perpetrators'version of the events (see Kmetty v. Hungary, no. 57967/00, § 42, 16 December 2003). As to the tort proceedings, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the domestic courts heard certain inmates. However, their statements were subject to somewhat conflicting evaluations and did not have attributed to them sufficient evidentiary weight. The courts once again based their conclusions on the reports and statements by the warders and officers. In fact, it appears that the domestic authorities did not make any meaningful attempt to bring those responsible for the ill-treatment to account."

The colony administration took every possible precaution to avoid the spread of disease. Prior to the group's arrival, the colony administration carried out explanatory work, lecturing inmates on AIDS and how it is transmitted. On their arrival in the colony the HIV-positive detainees were accommodated in separate premises and were allocated sterilised medical equipment and tableware. The administration had ensured safe sanitary conditions by assigning a separate day in the bathhouse for those detainees and washing their bedding and clothes separately. Furthermore, the use of drugs, sexual contact and tattooing, which are the means by which the virus could have been transmitted, were forbidden in the colony. The Government pointed out that there were no cases of HIV transmission and that the applicant did not argue otherwise. They further stressed that while admitting the HIV-positive detainees to a regular colony the colony administration had followed the CPT recommendations prescribing that no form of segregation should be envisaged in respect of HIV-positive detainees."

The Court also does not overlook the fact that the colony administration employed a harm-reduction technique, namely condom distribution, together with universal precaution policies such as sterilising medical equipment for each patient. The mere fact that HIV-positive detainees use the same medical, sanitary, catering and other facilities as all other prisoners does not in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Korobov and Others v. Russia (dec.), no. 67086/01, 2 March 2006). The administration provided inmates with accurate and objective information about HIV infection and AIDS, clearly identifying ways in which HIV can be transmitted. The Court attributes particular importance to the HIV risk-reduction counselling which was performed by the colony administration (see, by contrast, Salmanov v.

On 13 February 2006 the Presidium of the Kaliningrad Regional Court expressly acknowledged that the courts which had heard the case had not granted the applicant leave to appear at the hearings, in violation of Russian law. The Presidium quashed the judgments of 23 September and 18 November 2003 and ordered a re- examination of the case. The Court further notes that following the decision of 13 February 2006, on 29 March 2006 the Tsentralniy District Court re-examined the applicant's case in his presence and issued a judgment in his favour, quashing the prosecutor's decision of 9 July 2003.

In particular, the Court held:",
                "“According to the Court's well-established case-law, the applicability of the civil limb of Article 6 § 1 requires the existence of “a genuine and serious dispute” over a “civil right” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. Thus, a claim submitted to a tribunal for determination must be presumed to be genuine and serious unless there are clear indications to the contrary which might warrant the conclusion that the claim is frivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation (see, e.g. Benthem v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 October 1985, Series A no. 97, § 32 and Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, § 38).",
                "On the facts, the Court may accept that the claim made by the applicant was, as such, civil since the applicant demanded not only to declare the actions of prison authorities unlawful but also to grant him compensation for non-pecuniary damage allegedly caused through the authorities'fault (see, e.g., Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, § 92). As to whether the dispute was “genuine and serious”, the Court notes that under the domestic law compensation for non-pecuniary damage is only payable in respect of a proven prejudice resulting from actions or omissions of authorities breaching a plaintiff's rights. The Court further notes that from the applicant's statement of claim, the case file and the court decisions in the case it clearly follows that throughout the proceedings both at first instance and on appeal the applicant did not make any specific allegations of personal prejudice or interference with his individual rights which could, at least on arguable grounds, have called for an award of compensation under the applicable domestic law. His dissatisfaction was directed solely against the mere presence of HIV- positive prisoners in that prison and the alleged unlawfulness of the related legal acts and administrative decisions. In the Court's view these circumstances provide a sufficiently clear indication that the dispute in question was not genuine and serious (see, for example, Kaukonen v. Finland, no. 24738/94, Commission decision of 8 December 1997, Decisions and Reports (DR) 91-A, p. 14). Accordingly, Article 6 § 1 is not applicable in the instant case and the applicant's complaint should be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. ”",

The Court considers that the similar reasoning, as in the previous paragraph, applies to the applicant's complaint about his absence at the hearings on 7 August and 4 December 2002 in the proceedings concerning the screening of films. The Court takes note of the Bagrationovskiy District Court's finding that the applicant's claim had no basis in domestic law, since the legislation in force at the material time did not provide inmates, including the applicant, with the right to see films in prison facilities (see paragraph 77 above). Accordingly, the Court is not convinced that Article 6 applies to the proceedings at issue. However, even assuming that the applicant's action constituted “a civil claim” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as he did not merely seek to find the authorities'actions unlawful but claimed compensation for the non-pecuniary damage, the Court does not find that the dispute was “genuine and serious”. The Court notes that the applicant did not demonstrate either to the domestic courts or to the Court any impediments, personal prejudice or interference with his individual rights resulting from the authorities'failure to organise screenings of films which could, at least on arguable grounds, have called for an award of compensation under the applicable domestic law. The domestic courts found no direct link between the alleged failure and the alleged damage which, furthermore, was unsubstantiated. Accordingly, there was no established right that the domestic authorities failed to respect, no direct link between the alleged failure and the alleged damage, and, moreover, no evidence of any damage whatsoever (see Kunkova ad Kunkov v. Russia (dec.), no. 74690/01, 12 October 2006). The Court therefore finds that Article 6 § 1 is not applicable to the proceedings under consideration and the complaint must be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention."

The Court reiterates that the principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, which is one of the elements of the broader concept of a fair hearing, requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent (see Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § 39, 3 March 2000, and Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 33, Series A no. 274 ). The Court has previously found a violation of the right to a “public and fair hearing” in several cases against Russia, in which a party to civil proceedings was deprived of an opportunity to attend the hearing because of belated or defective service of the summons (see Yakovlev v. Russia, no. 72701/01, §§ 19 et seq., 15 March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no. 69889/01, §§ 27 et seq., 20 October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5 October 2006). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to an imprisoned applicant who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff's presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings” (see Kovalev v.

However, neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Penitentiary Code make special provision for the exercise of that right by individuals who are in custody, whether they are in pre-trial detention or are serving a sentence. In the present case the applicant's requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one's case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 § 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2005-II)."

Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff's personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms."

In the first three sets of the proceedings the courts decided to examine the applicant's civil claims, finding that there were no legal grounds to ensure the applicant's attendance. The situation was, however, different in the proceedings concerning the beatings in the colony.

In such a situation the only possibility for him was to appoint his relative, friend or an acquaintance to represent him in the proceedings. However, as it appears from the domestic courts'judgments, after they had refused the applicant leave to appear, they did not consider the means of securing his effective participation in the proceedings. They merely noted that the applicant was aware of his procedural rights and could have appointed a representative. They did not inquire whether the applicant was able to designate a representative, in particular whether, having regard to the time which he had already spent in detention, he still had a person willing to represent him before domestic courts and, if so, whether he had been able to contact that person and provide him with a power of authority. Moreover, it appears that at least in the two sets of the proceedings the applicant learned that he had not been granted leave to attend, at the same time as he received a copy of the judgment in which his claim was dismissed on the merits. Thus, the applicant was obviously unable to decide on a further course of action for the defence of his rights until such time as the decision refusing him leave to appear was communicated to him (see Khuzhin and Others v.

Yet the applicant did not claim that there were any new facts which were not raised by him before the District Court and thus, not addressed in the case file materials.

The Court accepts that the applicant suffered humiliation and distress on account of the inhuman and degrading conditions of his detention, the absence of an effective remedy in respect of his complaints about the conditions of his detention and ill-treatment inflicted on him on two occasions in the correctional colony. In addition, he did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of his complaints about the ill-treatment and he was unable to present his case effectively in the three sets of the civil proceedings.

Having regard to the documents submitted and the rates for the lawyers'work, the Court is satisfied that these rates are reasonable.

As regards the treatment of prisoners with mental-health problems, the Court has consistently held that Article 3 of the Convention requires States to ensure that the health and well-being of prisoners are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; Sławomir Musiał v. Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 20 January 2009; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 128, ECHR 2009). A lack of appropriate medical care for persons in custody is therefore capable of engaging a State’s responsibility under Article 3 (see Naumenko v. Ukraine, no. 42023/98, § 112, 10 February 2004). Obligations under Article 3 may go so far as to impose an obligation on the State to transfer prisoners (including mentally ill ones) to special facilities in order to receive adequate treatment (see Raffray Taddei v. France, no. 36435/07, § 63, 21 December 2010)."

In the case of mentally ill prisoners, the Court has held that the assessment of whether particular conditions of detention are incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has to take into consideration the vulnerability of those persons and, in some cases, their inability to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment (see, for example, Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244, and Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V). In addition, it is not enough for such detainees to be examined and a diagnosis made; instead, it is essential that proper treatment for the problem diagnosed and suitable medical supervision should also be provided (see Raffray Taddei, cited above, § 59).",

The decision of the Joint Court of Justice firstly sets out the proceedings which took place before that court: hearings had taken place on 10 May and 6 September 2012, at which the applicant, who was represented by counsel, was heard. A member of staff of the prison in Aruba was also heard, as were the psychologist M.V., the psychiatrist G.E.M. and relatives of the victim and their representative. The decision cites relevant parts of the sentencing court’s judgment of 11 March 1980 and summarises the findings contained in the reports drawn up about the applicant for the purpose of the periodic review (see paragraphs 36-42 below). A section entitled “The position of the relatives of the victim” reads as follows.",
                "“The relatives indicated at the hearing that they did not agree with a possible release of the convicted person. They stated that news of a possible release had reopened old wounds, that they were experiencing the psychological consequences of this, and that they were afraid of the convicted person. He has threatened them in the past and they have not observed any feelings of remorse or regret in him.",

                "In a report drawn up by the Curaçao Foundation for Probation and Social Rehabilitation of 10 May 2012 the Rapporteur addresses the position of the relatives. The Rapporteur notes in the first place that the relatives have so far barely been provided with psychological help or with support in coming to terms with their bereavement. He concludes that the victim’s mother still appears to struggle with issues she has not dealt with and about which she barely speaks, and that the father requires professional help in order to cope with his feelings. The relatives have told the Rapporteur that they feel insecure at the mere thought of the convicted person being released. They have further indicated that ever since the arrest of the convicted person and until the present time they have been ‘living in a prison’ and that this has also had adverse repercussions on their other children. The Foundation for Probation and Social Rehabilitation concludes that a possible conditional release of the convicted person would at this stage have far-reaching psychological consequences for the relatives.”",
                "The decision goes on to observe that, in the Acting Procurator General’s submission, there was not a single objective indication from which it could be inferred that the risk of the applicant’s committing an offence had disappeared or diminished, that an early release would seriously shock the surviving relatives, and that it would also shock society to such an extent that this would hinder the applicant’s possible reintegration. After describing the position put forward on behalf of the applicant, the Joint Court of Justice then came to its assessment, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows.",
                "“8.2 The convicted person’s deprivation of liberty has at present lasted considerably more than twenty years, namely over thirty-three years. The court must therefore assess whether the further unconditional execution of the life sentence no longer serves a reasonable purpose.",
                "8.3 It follows from the reasons given by the [sentencing] court for the imposition of the life sentence ... that the aim of this sentence was to protect society against recidivism by the convicted person. The risk of recidivism was deemed by the [sentencing] court to be particularly high, while treatment was not considered possible.",
                "8.4 The Court will therefore first and foremost have to assess to what extent the risk of recidivism existing at the time is still present today. In this connection it is firstly to be noted that at the time that risk was deemed to be particularly high in view of the personality of the convicted person, and that since then no treatment in any shape or form has taken place.",
                "8.5 After the Court had commissioned two experts at its hearing of 10 May 2012, psychologist M.V. and psychiatrist G.E.M. reported on the convicted person’s personality and the risk of recidivism. Unlike the defence, the Court is of the view that both the examination carried out and the report drawn up by the psychologist are of adequate quality and expertise. ...",
                "8.6 It appears from the ... findings of both experts that the convicted person is still suffering from a disorder, namely an antisocial personality disorder. The Court deduces from the findings that this disorder has a negative bearing on the risk of recidivism and hampers possible reintegration into society. The Court further considers that the nature of the offence committed by the convicted person – the killing of a six-year-old girl for the sole purpose of hurting her aunt, his former girlfriend – is bizarre and, as was concluded at the time, must be attributed to the psychopathically disturbed personality of the convicted person. The Court notes that important aspects of that disturbed personality, such as the antisocial personality, the limited development of his conscience and the lack of empathy, are currently still present. No treatment has taken place during the period of detention. It is furthermore not the case, as would be customary within the framework of treatment, that the circumstances which led him to his deed have been discussed with him so that he might subsequently have acquired an insight into how to avoid or defy such circumstances. In the case of the convicted person it would have been expected that in the course of such discussions his relationship with women and the question of dealing with rejection would have been addressed. As already mentioned, no such discussions or treatment have taken place. Also, at the hearing the convicted person did not demonstrate that he was capable of holding himself to account for the seriousness and absurdity of the murder or of understanding how he was able to commit it.",
                "8.7 The foregoing leads the Court to conclude that the risk of the convicted person’s reoffending if he were released is such that the protection of society should prevail. This is not altered by the fact that the convicted person has been functioning well and without problems in prison in recent years. After all, and just as the experts have pointed out, prison life is very structured and circumstances such as those under which the convicted person committed his crime are absent there. Such circumstances may occur outside the prison and – having regard to the aforementioned personality and the fact that no treatment has taken place – the Court considers the risk of the convicted person’s reoffending if confronted with such circumstances to be too great.",
                "8.8 The Court further takes the position of the victim’s relatives into account. It has been sufficiently established that conditional release would at the present time entail adverse psychological consequences for them. The Court observes in this connection that over the years the relatives have also not been provided with adequate support to help them come to terms with their grief or, if necessary, with treatment for their psychological problems. It is therefore easily understandable that they are very shocked now that the possibility of the convicted person’s conditional release is being considered for the first time. In this context the Court attaches relevance to the fact that after he committed his crime the convicted person threatened to harm the relatives and in this way contributed to their sense of insecurity. The convicted person has not demonstrated that he has any insight into the consequences of his deed or his subsequent actions.",
                "8.9 On the basis of the foregoing, the Court is of the opinion that the continued execution of the life sentence still serves a reasonable purpose. The Court will accordingly not proceed to order the conditional release of the convicted person.",
                "8.10 Having regard to the foregoing, the Court also perceives no cause to adjourn its examination pending further investigations, as requested by the defence as an alternative course of action.",
                "8.11 The Court adds that it is aware of the fact that its considerations as set out under points 8.6 and 8.7 would appear to offer little prospect of release in the future, as this would imperatively require that in the coming period some form of treatment should take place in which, in any event, aspects such as crime analysis, relationships and rejection would need to be addressed. Perhaps such treatment can be organised in some way in the [prison in Aruba]. The Court further considers that the position of the relatives may also be different at the time of a subsequent review if they continue to receive the necessary support in dealing with their feelings of mourning, anger and fear.",
                "8.12 The Court finally notes that it has also had regard to the commotion which the possibility of a conditional release has caused in society and which has appeared from the submitted newspaper articles and the considerable public interest. A large part of the community perhaps thinks that the perpetrator of a crime such as the murder of [the victim] should never be allowed to regain his liberty. In the Court’s examination this has not, however, played a decisive role. After all, society’s need for retribution should be considered to have been sufficiently assuaged after a period of detention of more than thirty-three years. As noted above, the aim of the continuation of that sentence is currently no longer retribution but the protection of society against possible recidivism.",

                "2. Was this disturbance and/or inadequacy already present at the time of the offences with which he is charged?",
                "Reply : The inadequate development in particular has been present all his life, and therefore also at the time of the offences with which he is charged, although it may be said that everything accelerated rapidly at that time.",
                "3. If so, was this the case to such an extent that the accused, were he to be found guilty of the offences, should generally be considered, in the current state of Netherlands Antillean society, as not responsible for them or only to a greater or lesser extent?",
                "Reply : The Rapporteur would conclude that the accused, having regard to the replies under 1 and 2, should be considered as having diminished criminal responsibility, but he nevertheless still considers that the accused is for the most part responsible for the acts, if they are found proven, which he has committed. The Rapporteur would especially conclude that he would not call the accused insane, either before, during or after the offence; ... the accused has never withdrawn into a bizarre and mad world of his own but has always lived in a primitive, primary sensory world and he has succeeded, whenever his existence was not under stress, to participate in society to a reasonable extent.",
                "4. At the time of the offences, did he have the insight to realise that committing them was morally reprehensible and would not be tolerated by society?",
                "Reply : According to the Rapporteur he must have had such insight, but he subsequently completely suppressed and replaced it by a fantasy in view of the threat of destruction of his own personality structure.",
                "5. If he did have such insight, would he have been capable of determining his will and his actions accordingly?",
                "Reply : See the reply to question 4. Also partly because of that, the Rapporteur has reached a conclusion of diminished criminal responsibility.",
                "6. Can it be expected that the accused might commit the same offence again or disrupt public order in a different manner?",
                "Reply : Having regard to what has been written and concluded above, the accused is certainly capable of committing a similar act or of causing a different disruption of public order.",
                "7. Does his mental state require that the accused be committed to a lunatic asylum?",
                "Reply : In view of the reply to question 3 it may be said that this is not necessary.",
                "8. What practical guidelines can you give and/or what proposals that are feasible in present-day society can you make in order to improve or bring about a recovery and/or a better development of the accused?",
                "Reply : In view of the replies under 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 my advice would be that the accused should be committed to a mental asylum where, certainly, for a fairly long period institutional treatment under very strict surveillance ought to take place. On Curaçao we have the choice only between prison and the national psychiatric hospital. Taking into consideration that for the time being the risk of recidivism is very great, even if treatment were to be commenced immediately, and that intensive surveillance is consequently of primordial importance (such surveillance being impossible in the national psychiatric hospital!), as well as the fact that the accused is not to be considered insane within the meaning of the law, admission to the national psychiatric hospital is wholly contraindicated. The sole option remaining is for the accused, should he be found guilty of the offences with which he has been charged, to undergo his sentence in prison (a transfer to, for example, a mental asylum in the Netherlands is in my opinion not possible because of the accused’s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally). The Rapporteur strongly advises that, if possible, attempts should be made in the prison setting to attain a stronger personality structure in order to avoid recidivism in the future.”"

The risk that he will reoffend or get into trouble in some other way upon return to society is considered to be present (moderate risk in comparison with the forensic population). ... In general the subject can be described as having an antisocial personality whose more unpleasant manifestations have been mitigated. ... It is reasonably certain that his personality will not change. Personality is formed up to age 35, after which only small changes take place. The examination shows that the subject’s personality profile is fairly rigid. He will therefore always be a fairly unpleasant person in his relations with others and will always have difficulty in establishing and maintaining social contacts.

This change in behaviour is largely attributable to the structure provided by the prison setting and the fact that he is much older now (almost 60) and is likely to become more and more moderate as the years go by. ...

We are aware that this resembles the regulation of pardons but would emphatically stress that this procedure does not affect the possible granting of a pardon according to the normal procedure. The aim of the procedure [provided for in Article 1:30] is to prevent the execution of the life imprisonment sentence automatically or for improper reasons leading to a life without hope for the persons concerned. Naturally the interests of the sentenced person should be weighed against the interests of society, and in particular the position of the relatives of the victim or of the victims themselves needs to be taken into account.

However, in recent years there has been a trend towards placing more emphasis on rehabilitation, as demonstrated notably by the Council of Europe’s legal instruments. While rehabilitation was recognised as a means of preventing recidivism, more recently, and more positively, it constitutes rather the idea of resocialisation through the fostering of personal responsibility. This objective is reinforced by the development of the “progression principle”: in the course of serving a sentence, a prisoner should move progressively through the prison system thereby moving from the early days of a sentence, when the emphasis may be on punishment and retribution, to the latter stages, when the emphasis should be on preparation for release.",

While this was different for the applicant’s sister Altagracia, who had kept in contact with her brother during the second part of his detention in Aruba, the Government questioned whether, in a situation where an applicant’s closest blood relatives, namely his children, had never had any contact with their father or showed any interest in pursuing the application, it fell to another relative to come forward."

Despite the costs involved, Mr van Heyningen, who had been living in the European part of the Kingdom since 1999, had managed to visit his father in prison six times and had also maintained contact with him by telephone.

He had subsequently spent more than thirty years in prison without ever receiving treatment – any psychiatric help he may have been offered was no more than the basic kind of assistance available in all prisons and could not be equated to treatment. Neither had the possibility of a transfer to the Netherlands, in order to receive treatment there, ever been envisaged. According to the applicant, it was unrealistic to expect him to have been able to recognise that he was in need of treatment and to raise this issue, as the Chamber had considered in its judgment; the necessity of treatment had, in any event, already been established and the authorities were aware of it."

None of the pardon requests lodged by him had led to a psychological or psychiatric examination with a view to determining whether he continued to constitute a danger to society; nor had the prison authorities been asked to issue a report about him pursuant to any of his petitions for pardon. The introduction of the periodic-review procedure, while offering a theoretical possibility of release, was ineffective in the circumstances of the applicant’s case, since as long as he had not been provided with treatment, it could not lead to any conclusion other than that he was still too dangerous to be considered for a reprieve.

Moreover, seven of the nine persons on whom a life sentence had been imposed in the Netherlands Antilles since 1980 had sought a pardon and in two instances, including the applicant’s case, a pardon request had been granted. According to the Government, this showed that, even if pardons were granted only rarely, there was nevertheless a genuine de facto possibility that a life sentence could be reduced by means of a pardon. In addition, the obligatory periodic review of life sentences – which, the Government conceded, had only come into force after the application was lodged with the Court – provided for the release on parole of a life prisoner if the Joint Court of Justice was of the opinion that a continuation of the custodial sentence would no longer serve any reasonable purpose."

There had been no custodial clinic in either Curaçao or Aruba and the applicant’s transfer to such an institution in the Netherlands had been considered impossible in view of his limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally. Mental-health treatment thus specifically not being part of the Joint Court of Justice’s judgment, no blame could be attached to the national authorities for not executing a measure that had not been imposed. It did not appear from either the applicant’s contacts with the prisons’ social workers or the numerous letters he had addressed to various authorities that a lack of mental-health assistance had been his main concern.

In this connection the Government referred to the letter of Dr M. de O., according to which the applicant had, upon his arrival in the prison in Curaçao, been placed under psychiatric observation and good contact of a therapeutic nature had been established with a view to his rehabilitation (see paragraph 34 above). This therapeutic contact had ended when the applicant had been moved to Aruba, a transfer he had specifically requested despite being aware that the prison complex there did not comprise a Forensic Observation and Counselling Unit and that the availability of psychiatric help would be limited. The Government had not been informed of any contact between the applicant and psychiatrists or psychologists in Aruba until 2011, when the first periodic review of his life sentence had been carried out. Psychiatric help had been available to him in Aruba since the adoption of the judgment of the Joint Court of Justice of 21 September 2012."

While the Government acknowledged that long-term imprisonment could have a number of desocialising effects on inmates, they submitted that in practice the applicant had been able to engage in a relevant daily programme in the prison in Aruba.

                "99. It is well established in the Court’s case-law that the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment on an adult offender is not in itself prohibited by or incompatible with Article 3 or any other Article of the Convention (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 97, and references cited therein), provided that it is not grossly disproportionate (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 102). The Court has, however, held that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence on an adult may raise an issue under Article 3 (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 97). A life sentence does not become irreducible by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. No issue arises under Article 3 if a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 98, and Vinter and Others, cited above, § 108). On the basis of a detailed review of the relevant considerations emerging from its case-law and from recent comparative and international-law trends in respect of life sentences, the Court found in Vinter and Others that a life sentence can remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention only if there is both a prospect of release and a possibility of review, both of which must exist from the imposition of the sentence (see Vinter and Others, cited above, §§ 104 ‑ 18 and 122). It further observed in that case that the comparative and international-law materials before it showed clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., § 120, see also Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, § 61, 13 November 2014). It is for the States to decide – and not for the Court to prescribe – what form (executive or judicial) that review should take (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 99, and Vinter and Others, cited above, §§ 104 and 120). The Court has held that presidential clemency may thus be compatible with the requirements flowing from its case-law (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 102)."

                "100. The Court has further found that a prisoner cannot be detained unless there are legitimate penological grounds for incarceration, which include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. While many of these grounds will be present at the time a life sentence is imposed, the balance between these justifications for detention is not necessarily static and might shift in the course of the execution of the sentence. It is only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence, that these factors or shifts can be properly evaluated (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 111). The review required in order for a life sentence to be reducible should therefore allow the domestic authorities to consider whether, in the course of the sentence, any changes in the life prisoner and progress towards his or her rehabilitation are of such significance that continued detention is no longer justified on legitimate penological grounds (ibid. , § 119). This assessment must be based on rules having a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty (ibid., §§ 125 and 129; see also László Magyar v. Hungary, no. 73593/10, § 57, 20 May 2014, and Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, §§ 255, 257 and 262, ECHR 2014) and the conditions laid down in domestic legislation must reflect the conditions set out in the Court’s case-law (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 128). Thus, a possibility of being granted a pardon or release on compassionate grounds for reasons related to ill-health, physical incapacity or old age does not correspond to the notion of “prospect of release” as formulated in Kafkaris (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 127, and Öcalan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03 and 3 others, § 203, 18 March 2014). The Court held in a recent case that the assessment must be based on objective, pre ‑ established criteria (see Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, § 137, ECHR 2014). The prisoner’s right to a review entails an actual assessment of the relevant information (see László Magyar, cited above, § 57), and the review must also be surrounded by sufficient procedural guarantees (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 105, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 262). To the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may be required that reasons be provided, and this should be safeguarded by access to judicial review (see László Magyar, cited above, § 57, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, §§ 258 and 262). Finally, in assessing whether the life sentence is reducible de facto it may be of relevance to take account of statistical information on prior use of the review mechanism in question, including the number of persons having been granted a pardon (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 103; Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, §§ 252 and 262; and Bodein, cited above, § 59).",

                "101. As set out in the preceding paragraph, the review required in order for a life sentence to be reducible should permit the authorities to assess any changes in the life prisoner and any progress towards rehabilitation made by him or her. In Vinter and Others (cited above) the Grand Chamber thus addressed the problem of how to determine whether, in a given case, a life sentence could be regarded as reducible specifically in the light of the rehabilitation function of incarceration. In this context, it held that it would be incompatible with human dignity – which lay at the very essence of the Convention system – forcefully to deprive a person of his freedom without striving towards his rehabilitation and providing him with the chance to regain that freedom at some future date (ibid., § 113). It went on to note that there was now clear support in European and international law for the principle that all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, be offered the possibility of rehabilitation and the prospect of release if that rehabilitation was achieved (ibid., § 114). While punishment remained one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy was now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, even in the case of life prisoners; this was expressed in Rules 6, 102.1 and 103.8 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, Resolution (76) 2 and Recommendations Rec(2003)23 and Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers, statements by the CP|T, and the practice of a number of Contracting States. The same commitment to rehabilitation was to be found in international law, as expressed, inter alia, in Article 10 § 3 of the ICCPR and the General Comment on that Article (ibid., §§ 115-18)."

The Court observes that the principle of rehabilitation, that is, the reintegration into society of a convicted person, is reflected in international norms (see paragraphs 70-76 above) and has not only been recognised but has over time also gained increasing importance in the Court’s case-law under various provisions of the Convention (see, apart from Vinter and Others, cited above, for instance Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 72, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 28, ECHR 2007 ‑ V; James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09 and 2 others, § 209, 18 September 2012; and Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, §§ 121 and 144 ‑ 45, ECHR 2015). In a slightly different context the Court has, moreover, held that, in circumstances where a Government seek to rely solely on the risk posed by offenders to the public in order to justify their continued detention, regard must be had to the need to encourage the rehabilitation of those offenders (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, § 218). One of the aims of rehabilitation is to prevent reoffending and thus to ensure the protection of society."

            [
                "103. Notwithstanding the fact that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, a right to rehabilitation, the Court’s case-law thus presupposes that convicted persons, including life prisoners, should be allowed to rehabilitate themselves. Indeed, the Court has held that “ ... a whole life prisoner is entitled to know ... what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions” (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 122). It has also held, with reference to Vinter and Others, that national authorities must give life prisoners a real opportunity to rehabilitate themselves (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 264). It follows from this that a life prisoner must be realistically enabled, to the extent possible within the constraints of the prison context, to make such progress towards rehabilitation that it offers him or her the hope of one day being eligible for parole or conditional release. This could be achieved, for example, by setting up and periodically reviewing an individualised programme that will encourage the sentenced prisoner to develop himself or herself to be able to lead a responsible and crime-free life."

            [
                "104. Life prisoners are thus to be provided with an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. As to the extent of any obligations incumbent on States in this regard, the Court considers that even though States are not responsible for achieving the rehabilitation of life prisoners (ibid.), they nevertheless have a duty to make it possible for such prisoners to rehabilitate themselves. Were it otherwise, a life prisoner could in effect be denied the possibility of rehabilitation, with the consequence that the review required for a life sentence to be reducible, in which a life prisoner’s progress towards rehabilitation is to be assessed, might never be genuinely capable of leading to the commutation, remission or termination of the life sentence or to the conditional release of the prisoner. In this connection the Court reiterates the principle – well established in its case-law – that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 123, ECHR 2010). The obligation to offer a possibility of rehabilitation is to be seen as an obligation of means, not one of result. However, it entails a positive obligation to secure prison regimes to life prisoners which are compatible with the aim of rehabilitation and enable such prisoners to make progress towards their rehabilitation. In this context the Court has previously held that such an obligation exists in situations where it is the prison regime or the conditions of detention which obstruct rehabilitation (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 266).",

                "105. As regards the treatment of prisoners with mental-health problems, the Court has consistently held that Article 3 of the Convention requires States to ensure that the health and well-being of prisoners are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; Sławomir Musiał v. Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 20 January 2009; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 128, ECHR 2009). A lack of appropriate medical care for persons in custody is therefore capable of engaging a State’s responsibility under Article 3 (see Naumenko v. Ukraine, no. 42023/98, § 112, 10 February 2004). Obligations under Article 3 may go so far as to impose an obligation on the State to transfer prisoners (including mentally ill ones) to special facilities in order to receive adequate treatment (see Raffray Taddei v. France, no. 36435/07, § 63, 21 December 2010)."

Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244, and Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V).

Life prisoners who have been held to be criminally responsible for the offences of which they have been found guilty – and who are therefore not considered “persons of unsound mind” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention – may nevertheless have certain mental-health problems; they may for instance have behavioural or social problems or suffer from various kinds of personality disorders, all of which may impact on the risk of their reoffending. The Court has not previously dealt with the specific issue of the reducibility of life sentences imposed on persons who have been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disability and/or a mental-health condition. Against the background of the case-law set out above (paragraphs 99-106), the Court finds the following approach to be appropriate in this regard."

                "108. For a State to comply with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in respect of life prisoners belonging to this category, the Court considers that it is firstly required that an assessment be made of those prisoners’ needs as regards treatment with a view to facilitating their rehabilitation and reducing the risk of their reoffending. This assessment should also address the likely chances of success of any identified forms of treatment, given that Article 3 cannot entail an obligation for a State to enable a life prisoner to receive treatment that is not realistically expected to have any significant impact in helping the life prisoner to rehabilitate himself or herself. For this reason, account is to be taken of the life prisoner’s individual situation and personality. The Court, moreover, recognises that certain mental-health conditions are not, or not easily, amenable to treatment. Given that, owing to their mental-health situation, such life prisoners may not themselves be sufficiently aware of a need for treatment, the aforementioned assessment should be conducted regardless of whether any request for treatment has been expressed by them (see paragraph 106 above). Where the assessment leads to the conclusion that a particular treatment or therapy may indeed help the life prisoner to rehabilitate himself or herself, he or she is to be enabled to receive that treatment to the extent possible within the constraints of the prison context (see the relevant Council of Europe instruments set out in paragraphs 66-69 above; see also paragraph 103 above). This is of particular importance where treatment in effect constitutes a precondition for the life prisoner’s possible future eligibility for release and is thus a crucial aspect of de facto reducibility of the life sentence."

In this connection the Court reiterates that States also have a duty under the Convention to take measures to protect the public from violent crime and that the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender’s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 108, with further references). States may fulfil that positive obligation to protect the public by continuing to detain life prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others v.

In the later years of his incarceration this in fact became the sole reason for the refusal to grant him release of any kind. While the risk of reoffending and the need to protect society are relevant penological grounds capable of justifying continued detention of a life prisoner (see paragraph 100 above), the Court will nevertheless have to assess whether the applicant in the specific circumstances of the present case was offered possibilities of rehabilitating himself also during the period of his imprisonment preceding the lodging by him of the present application, as the existence of such possibilities, in particular of any that addressed his mental-health problems, may have affected his prospects of release."

The Court observes in this connection that in the context of the criminal proceedings against him on charges of murder, the applicant was examined in 1979 by a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him as a retarded, infantile and narcissistic young man whose character structure had a serious disturbance of a psychopathiform nature and recommended that he receive institutional treatment for a lengthy period or that attempts be made in the prison setting to attain a stronger personality structure in order to avoid recidivism (see paragraph 33 above). Owing to the fact that no order for placement in a custodial clinic could be imposed in the Netherlands Antilles at that time – as the applicable law did not provide for such a measure – and considering that placement in such a clinic in the European part of the Kingdom was not feasible, the Joint Court of Justice imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant on 11 March 1980 (see paragraphs 15 ‑ 16 above). However, the Court considers that the applicant’s detention in a prison rather than in a custodial clinic could not have obviated the need for the recommended treatment.

The Court further notes that certain measures were taken and facilities offered which, even if their main purpose was not the applicant’s rehabilitation, may be considered conducive to that purpose. Thus, the applicant was transferred from Curaçao to Aruba in 1999. The applicant had requested this transfer in order to be closer to members of his family, and it was considered to be beneficial for his rehabilitation and psychologically favourable for him (see paragraphs 34 ‑ 35 above).

In this connection the Court notes that one of the judges of the Joint Court of Justice wrote in 1997, when consulted on a request for a pardon lodged by the applicant, that he considered it would be irresponsible to grant a pardon to the applicant, whose risk of reoffending had been established to be high and who had not received the treatment in prison that had been recommended (see paragraph 24 above). The Joint Court of Justice also noted in its advice to the Governor of Curaçao, relating to that same request for a pardon, that the applicant had not undergone any (psychiatric) treatment aimed at strengthening his personality structure in order to prevent recidivism (ibid.).

Although the Joint Court of Justice found that after thirty-three years the applicant’s imprisonment no longer served the aim of retribution, it concluded that his continued detention was necessary in order to protect the public as the risk of his reoffending remained too great to allow his release (see paragraphs 8.4, 8.6., 8.7 and 8.12 of the Joint Court of Justice’s decision set out in paragraph 32 above)."

In the Court’s view, very little, if any, relevance falls to be attached to the fact that the applicant himself had not apparently been concerned about procuring treatment and had preferred to be transferred from Curaçao to Aruba where the availability of psychiatric help was even more limited. It must be borne in mind that persons with mental-health problems may have difficulties in assessing their own situation or needs, and may be unable to indicate coherently, or even at all, that they require treatment (see paragraph 106 above)."

Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that the lack of any kind of treatment or even of any assessment of treatment needs and possibilities meant that, at the time the applicant lodged his application with the Court, any request by him for a pardon was in practice incapable of leading to the conclusion that he had made such significant progress towards rehabilitation that his continued detention would no longer serve any penological purpose. This finding likewise applies to the first, and in fact only, periodic review that was carried out of the applicant’s life sentence. This leads the Court to the conclusion that the applicant’s life sentence was not de facto reducible as required by Article 3."

The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (ibid., § 120, and Bouyid, cited above, § 101)."

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see Bouyid, cited above, §§ 82 and 83, with further case-law references).",

As can be seen from the case file he was found to have sustained a number of injuries subsequent to the events in dispute – in particular, injuries on his lower legs, hand, forearm and right side (see paragraph 12 above)."

Moreover, the applicant ’ s cellmate, A.D., stated that the applicant had told him about the alleged assaults and had shown him marks left by the beatings (see paragraph 25 above). Similarly, the escort officer, M.S., gave evidence that he had seen bruises on the applicant (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant ’ s co ‑ accused, V.P., stated that the escort officers had beaten the applicant (see paragraph 30 above), and another of the co-accused, P.V., gave evidence that he had heard the applicant screaming (see paragraph 32 above)."

Latvia, no. 8347/07, § 94, 28 April 2016, which also concerned ill ‑ treatment by the detainee escort officers in the premises of the Riga Regional Court ). The statements provided by the detainee escort officers were all, except one, drafted in broadly the same manner, despite the officers having been questioned separately, and no face-to-face confrontation was organised between the applicant and those officers (see paragraph 28 above). Therefore, the Court has no reason to doubt the applicant ’ s account of events and finds that the injuries found on his body were sustained as a result of assaults by the detainee escort officers on 20, 21, 24 and 25 May 2010 (see Mustafa Hajili, cited above, § 41 )."

His mouth was then fixed in an open position by means of a metal mouth-widener. His tongue was pulled out of his mouth with a pair of metal tongs which he claims left it numb and bleeding each time.

Indeed, the only reference attesting to the start of the force-feeding was a simple note of 24 August 2001 indicating that force feeding had taken place and the type and quantity of food that had been administered. No reasons were given for the decision to start the force-feeding procedure.

However, prisoners “continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty” ( Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 69, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ). It is, moreover, an essential part of a prisoner's right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), cited above, § 61 ). Subject to necessary security measures, detainees should be allowed to meet not only their relatives but also other persons wishing to visit them (see paragraph 48 above).

The courts confined themselves to a perceived general need to preserve the safety of detainees and visitors. The Court notes that the applicant was accused of fraud (see paragraph 7 above). In the absence of any risk of collusion, re-offending or escaping, it can reasonably be considered that allowing the applicant to meet with his visitors would not have created a security risk. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the applicant was allowed such visits on a number of occasions in 2004 (see paragraph 106 above) and it has not been claimed that the applicant's personality or other relevant circumstances obtaining in 2003 had drastically changed in 2004."

The fact that the courts permitted such meetings (see paragraph 37 above) also confirms this conclusion. On the other hand, the effect of the long period of time (at least one year in 2003) during which the applicant had not been able to have any physical contact with his visitors, the fact that he could only maintain a relationship with them by correspondence and by meeting with them in prison (see paragraph 37 above) and the physical barriers to free discussion created by the glass cabin cannot be ignored (see the findings of the CPT, paragraph 47 above, and the applicant's unchallenged claims regarding the lack of privacy in the five cabins situated next to each other, referred to in paragraph 105 above ).

The judicial authorities had taken immediate action on the report in deciding to transfer him to Muret Prison so that he would be closer to Toulouse University Hospital. The fact that he had been transferred there on 19 July 2000, less than a month after the expert had submitted his findings in the above-mentioned report, demonstrated the constant concern on the part of the relevant authorities to ensure that the applicant's conditions of detention were compatible with his state of health.",

At the time of the incident of 30 May 2000 the considerable portion of his sentence remaining to be served, the successive refusals of his applications for a pardon on medical grounds and his criminal record could legitimately have aroused fears that he would attempt to abscond with the help of local accomplices. The Government further stated that, according to information supplied by the prison authorities, the use of restraints on the applicant's lower limbs had been stopped, albeit on an unspecified date, on account of the pain he was suffering and the fact that he had to use a walking stick to move about. At a similar time the handcuffs had been replaced by a lighter chain, as the applicant had also complained of pain in his arms as a result of the intravenous drip.",

In spite of that, the authorities had merely transferred him to Muret Prison instead of suspending his sentence as was possible under Article 722 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or allowing his application for a pardon on medical grounds.

The applicant added that the journeys to hospital in a prison van had been painful (an ambulance had not been used for hospital visits until May 2000). He also asserted that during the chemotherapy sessions his feet had been chained up and one of his wrists had been attached to his hospital bed. He had also been kept in chains during an operation carried out in late 1999 with his escort and gendarmes present, on which occasion he had been fitted with a “ portacath ” so that treatment could be administered to him. The applicant considered that the use of handcuffs had been unjustified in view of his physical weakness and his unblemished disciplinary record, and submitted that there had been no particular reason for the escort officers to think that he posed any kind of danger.",

The Government submitted that the applicant's health had been regularly monitored by the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit at Lannemezan Prison and at Toulouse University Hospital. When he had been transferred to Muret Prison, his medical records had been handed over to the prison's consultation and treatment unit, which had consequently been able to follow up the treatment. From November 2000 onwards the applicant had been taken to Toulouse University Hospital for monthly chemotherapy sessions as an outpatient. That treatment had continued on a regular basis until the applicant had been released.",
                "The Government observed that the applicant had been in prison since 20 July 1994 but had not had any health problems until late 1998. His health had therefore deteriorated from 1998 onwards. A medical certificate drawn up on 12 May 2000 in connection with an application for a pardon had mentioned the need for an expert opinion. The ensuing report, drawn up on 28 June 2000, had emphasised the problems arising on account of the applicant's refusal to consent to the cancer treatment he had been prescribed; in that context, the expert had concluded that the applicant should be looked after in a specialist unit. The judicial authorities had taken immediate action on the report in deciding to transfer him to Muret Prison so that he would be closer to Toulouse University Hospital. The fact that he had been transferred there on 19 July 2000, less than a month after the expert had submitted his findings in the above-mentioned report, demonstrated the constant concern on the part of the relevant authorities to ensure that the applicant's conditions of detention were compatible with his state of health.",
                "The Government noted that the applicant had been given a cell of his own at Muret Prison (although in their additional observations they stated that that had also been the case at Lannemezan Prison), that he had worked there and that he had also maintained contact with the outside world by means of the telephone, mail, the visiting room and periods of prison leave.",
                "As to the conduct of the chemotherapy sessions, the Government observed that the applicant had alluded to an incident on 30 May 2000 when he had attempted to alter the speed of his own drip. In that connection, they maintained that escort officers played no part in determining the time required for treatment or providing medical supervision, matters for which the medical and paramedical staff alone were responsible.",
                "As regards the use of handcuffs, the Government acknowledged that restraints had indeed been applied to the applicant during the journey between the prison and the hospital but had been removed as soon as he had arrived in the treatment room, where none of the prison staff had been present. They argued that the use of restraints had been justified by the applicant's previous convictions for serious offences (according to the Government, he had been sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment for murder on 5 May 1976, and to eight years' imprisonment for armed robbery on 15 June 1987) and by the fact that his family home in Toulouse was close by, so that it could not be ruled out that he might be assisted by local accomplices, particularly in view of the regularity and frequency of his journeys to the same hospital along an easily identifiable route. At the time of the incident of 30 May 2000 the considerable portion of his sentence remaining to be served, the successive refusals of his applications for a pardon on medical grounds and his criminal record could legitimately have aroused fears that he would attempt to abscond with the help of local accomplices. The Government further stated that, according to information supplied by the prison authorities, the use of restraints on the applicant's lower limbs had been stopped, albeit on an unspecified date, on account of the pain he was suffering and the fact that he had to use a walking stick to move about. At a similar time the handcuffs had been replaced by a lighter chain, as the applicant had also complained of pain in his arms as a result of the intravenous drip.",
                "In the Government's submission, all those factors showed that the relevant authorities had systematically taken the applicant's health into account in determining and altering his prison regime. That was borne out by the fact that as soon as the applicant had satisfied the statutory requirements for obtaining parole, his application had been examined and allowed within a very short space of time.",
                "Consequently, relying on the Court's decision in Papon v. France (no. 1) ((dec.), no. 64666/01, ECHR 2001-VI), the Government submitted that the applicant's conditions of detention had never attained a sufficient level of severity to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention."

It will therefore examine his complaint alleging a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the period extending from that date back to 8 January 1999, the date of the medical report in which the applicant's illness was first diagnosed – that is to say, a period of more than two years."

                "37. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 91, ECHR 2000-XI, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § 67, ECHR 2001-III). Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers, cited above, § 74)."

                "38. The Convention does not contain any provision relating specifically to the situation of persons deprived of their liberty, let alone where they are ill, but it cannot be ruled out that the detention of a person who is ill may raise issues under Article 3 of the Convention (see Chartier v. Italy, no. 9044/80, Commission's report of 8 December 1982, Decisions and Reports (DR) 33, p. 41; De Varga-Hirsch v. France, no. 9559/81, Commission decision of 9 May 1983, DR 33, p. 158; and B. v. Germany, no. 13047/87, Commission decision of 10 March 1988, DR 55, p. 271). In the case of a prisoner suffering from disorders associated with hereditary obesity, the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention because the applicant had been provided with care appropriate to his state of health. It considered, however, that detention per se inevitably affected prisoners suffering from serious disorders. It took care to point out that “in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures” and stated in conclusion that it would “appreciate any measures the Italian authorities could take vis-à-vis the applicant in order to alleviate the effects of his detention or to terminate it as soon as circumstances require” (see Chartier, Commission's report cited above, pp. 57-58). The Court recently observed that the detention of an elderly sick person over a lengthy period could fall within the scope of Article 3, although in the decision in question it held that the applicant's complaint under that Article was manifestly ill-founded (see Papon (no. 1), cited above). Health, age and severe physical disability are now among the factors to be taken into account under Article 3 of the Convention in France and the other member States of the Council of Europe in assessing a person's suitability for detention (see paragraphs 26, 27, 29 and 30 above)."

In Price v. the United Kingdom the Court held that detaining the applicant, who was four-limb deficient, in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (no. 33394/96, § 30, ECHR 2001-VII)."

Switzerland, judgment of 28 January 1994, Series A no. 280-A, opinion of the Commission, pp. 15-16, § 79). The Court has also emphasised the right of all prisoners to conditions of detention which are compatible with human dignity, so as to ensure that the manner and method of execution of the measures imposed do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention; in addition, besides the health of prisoners, their well-being also has to be adequately secured, given the practical demands of imprisonment (see Kudła, cited above, § 94)."

In the instant case the Court observes that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences considered that the applicant's state of health was in itself incompatible with detention from 22 March 2001 onwards.

Accordingly, the instant case raises the question whether the applicant's state of health, which was giving serious cause for concern, was compatible with his continued imprisonment in that condition. In a climate of increasing awareness of the prison situation, France is faced with the problem of sick prisoners and their continued detention in circumstances which no longer appear justified in terms of protecting society (see the National Assembly report referred to in paragraph 25 above)."

            [
                "43. The Court takes note of developments in France 's legislation on the matter, which has increased the powers of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences in respect of seriously ill prisoners. As it has already pointed out, French law affords the national authorities various means of intervening where detainees are suffering from serious medical problems. A prisoner's health may be taken into account in a decision to grant parole under Article 729 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as amended by the Law of 15 June 2000, in particular where the prisoner has “to undergo treatment”. Furthermore, under the Law of 4 March 2002 on patients' rights, prisoners' sentences may be suspended if they are suffering from a life-threatening illness or if their condition is incompatible in the long term with their continued detention (see paragraph 26 above). The Court accordingly notes that the health of a detainee is now among the factors to be taken into account in determining how a custodial sentence is to be served, particularly as regards its length. In that way, practical expression has been given to the Court's statement that “the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies” (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 101, ECHR 1999-V)."
            ],
            [
                "44. The Court notes that the procedural arrangements introduced by the laws of 15 June 2000 and 4 March 2002 have provided for new remedies before the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, enabling prisoners whose health has deteriorated significantly to apply to be released at short notice; those remedies are available in addition to the possibility of applying for a pardon on medical grounds, which the French President alone is empowered to grant. It considers that these judicial procedures may provide sufficient guarantees to ensure the protection of prisoners' health and well-being, which States must reconcile with the legitimate requirements of a custodial sentence. However, it must be acknowledged that those procedures were not available to the applicant during the period of detention considered by the Court and that the State's only response to his situation was to refuse his applications for a pardon on medical grounds without stating any reasons. As the Government noted, the applicant could not have been released on parole until he satisfied the eligibility requirements – that is to say, not until 2001. Moreover, the possibility of applying to have his sentence suspended did not exist at the time of his detention."

                "45. That being so, the Court will examine whether the applicant's continued detention gave rise to a situation which attained a sufficient level of severity to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court observes that the applicant's health was found to be giving more and more cause for concern and to be increasingly incompatible with detention. The report of 28 June 2000 referred to the difficulty of providing cancer treatment in prison and recommended transferring him to a specialist unit. It also mentioned the applicant's psychological condition, which had been aggravated by the stress of being ill and had affected his life expectancy and caused his health to decline. The letter of 20 November 2000 from the UCSA doctor to the applicant confirmed that his health was deteriorating and referred only to the possibility of a remission in the disease. All those factors show that the applicant's illness was progressing and that the prison was scarcely equipped to deal with it, yet no special measures were taken by the prison authorities. Such measures could have included admitting the applicant to hospital or transferring him to any other institution where he could be monitored and kept under supervision, particularly at night."

There is no doubt that the applicant was kept in chains while under escort, although the chains started to be applied less tightly once the doctors advised against using restraints. However, it has not been established that he was chained up while receiving treatment or that members of the prison escort were present on those occasions. The Court notes, however, that the reply from the Regional Director of the Prison Service about the use of handcuffs implicitly suggests that the applicant's illness did not exempt him from being handcuffed and that the manner in which the handcuffs were used is standard practice in the context of detention."
            ],
            [
                "47. The Court reiterates that handcuffing does not normally give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention where the measure has been imposed in connection with a lawful detention and does not entail use of force, or public exposure, exceeding what is reasonably considered necessary. In this regard, it is important to consider, for instance, whether there is a danger that the person concerned might abscond or cause injury or damage (see Raninen v. Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, p. 2822, § 56). In the instant case, having regard to the applicant's health, to the fact that he was being taken to hospital, to the discomfort of undergoing a chemotherapy session and to his physical weakness, the Court considers that the use of handcuffs was disproportionate to the needs of security. As regards the danger presented by the applicant, and notwithstanding his criminal record, the Court notes the absence of any previous conduct or other evidence giving serious grounds to fear that there was a significant danger of his absconding or resorting to violence. Lastly, the Court notes the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture concerning the conditions in which prisoners are transferred to hospital to undergo medical examinations – conditions which, in the Committee's opinion, continue to raise problems in terms of medical ethics and respect for human dignity (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant's descriptions of the conditions in which he was escorted to and from hospital do not seem very far removed from the situations causing the Committee concern in this area."

In the final analysis, the Court considers that the national authorities did not take sufficient care of the applicant's health to ensure that he did not suffer treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. His continued detention, especially from June 2000 onwards, undermined his dignity and entailed particularly acute hardship that caused suffering beyond that inevitably associated with a prison sentence and treatment for cancer. In conclusion, the Court considers that the applicant was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on account of his continued detention in the conditions examined above.",

Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A, no. 103; Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A, no. 298; Sürek v. Turkey (no.1) [GC], no. 26682/95, ECHR 1999-IV; Janowski v.

                "(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual's self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.",
                "(iv) In a democratic society individuals are entitled to comment on and criticise the administration of justice and the officials involved in it. Limits of acceptable criticism in respect of civil servants exercising their powers may admittedly in some circumstances be wider than in relation to private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions. Moreover, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive, abusive or defamatory attacks when on duty.",

                "“[T]he [authorities] applied law and practice under which there was a presumption that remand in custody was necessary in cases where the sentence faced went beyond a certain threshold of severity ...[While] the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element .... the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of pre-trial detention ...",
                "That is particularly true in the present case where under the applicable domestic law and practice the characterisation in law of the facts - and thus the sentence faced by the applicant - was determined by the prosecution authorities without judicial control of the question whether or not the evidence supported reasonable suspicion that the accused had committed an offence attracting a sentence of the relevant length ...",
                "The only other ground for the applicant's lengthy detention was the domestic courts'finding that there were no exceptional circumstances warranting release. However, that finding was not based on an analysis of all pertinent facts. The authorities regarded the applicant's arguments that he had never been convicted, that he had a family and a stable way of life, and that after the passage of time any possible danger of collusion or absconding had receded, as irrelevant.",
                "They did so because by virtue of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court's practice the presumption under that provision was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, re-offending or collusion was excluded due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained person to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he was bound to remain in detention on remand throughout the proceedings ...",
                "The Court reiterates that continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. Any system of mandatory detention on remand is per se incompatible with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see the Letellier v. France judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, §§ 35-53; the Clooth v. Belgium judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 225, § 44; the Muller v.

                "Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases.”"

The legal formulation of the rule and exception to it could, in the Court’s view, generally result in an over-inclusive regime. This conclusion goes hand in hand with the findings of the 2009 CPT report, which underlined that the procedure for allocating a prisoner to “N” status fails to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream prison population are accorded this status (see paragraph 130 above).

Nevertheless, the Court accepts that the initial decision of 12 October 2007 imposing the “N” regime on the applicant already at the pre-conviction stage was legitimate. In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable on the part of the authorities to consider that, for the sake of ensuring safety in prison, he should be subjected to tighter security controls, involving increased and constant supervision of his movements within and outside his cell, limitations on his contact and communication with the outside world and some form of segregation from the prison community.",
                "As the Court has already held in similar cases concerning organised crime, in particular those lodged by persons linked to Mafia-type organisations, the existing, continuing danger that an applicant may re ‑ establish contact with criminal organisations is an element that may justify applying even harsh isolation measures in order to exclude such a possibility (see, for instance, Messina (no. 2) (dec.), cited above). In the applicant’s case that possibility had to be taken into account.",
                "Also, the monitoring of a detainee’s behaviour via close-circuit television at all times, as in the present case, although certainly intrusive, is not per se incompatible with Article 3. This measure serves the purposes of both ensuring prison security and protecting the detainee himself from the risk of pressure or even physical attack by the criminal community which, in the context of organised crime, cannot be excluded."

However, for the reasons stated below, the Court cannot accept that the continued, routine and indiscriminate application of the full range of measures that the authorities were obliged to apply under the “N” regime for two years and nine months was necessary for maintaining prison security and compatible with Article 3 of the Convention."

                "171. It is true, as the Government pointed out (see paragraphs 145-148 above), that although the applicant was held in a solitary cell at a special high-security ward separated from the rest of the prison, he was not subjected to complete sensory or social isolation as there were three periods, each lasting around six weeks, during which he had another cellmate placed with him. He maintained a degree of daily contact with the prison staff, even if only limited, for the sake of a daily walk (see paragraphs 107-108 and 146 above). He also received family visits, had meetings with his lawyers (see paragraphs 54-71 above) and had access to the television and prison library (see paragraph 146 above). Accordingly, he was not subjected to total isolation but rather to a limited social isolation (see Messina (no. 2) (dec.), cited above; and Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 135).",
                "The list of visits received by the applicant in detention shows that, up to 19 January 2010, he had had 147 visits altogether, out of which 102 took place after the special regime was imposed on him (see paragraphs 68-71 above). The number of family visits over that period stood at 45 and the remaining were meetings with his lawyers or other meetings connected with the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 71 above). This, even considering that the visits were spread over more than two years, must have attenuated, at least to some extent, the consequences of the separation from others and daily solitude for the applicant’s mental and emotional well ‑ being.",

In the 2009 report the authorities were explicitly criticised for not having developed “a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities”. It was recommended that “educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with “N” status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day” (see paragraph 129 above). The CPT also pointed out that “placement in an “N” unit should not be a purely passive response to the prisoner’s attitude and behaviour” (see paragraph 130 above)."

Throughout his confinement in the high-security ward the applicant made numerous – but never successful – requests to the prison authorities, asking them to enable him to take part in any training, workshops, courses or any sports activities organised for ordinary inmates or to give him any unpaid work. No such activity was made available to him. In reaction to his complaints that isolation from other people was putting an exceptionally severe strain on him, the authorities said that the need to socialise with others was not a ground for qualifying for participation in activities in prison (see paragraphs 84-85 above). They were similarly inflexible when he asked for permission to have in his cell his own sports equipment, computer games, CD ‑ player and CDs with foreign language courses and music (see paragraph 84 above), even though such a minor concession could by no means threaten prison safety.",
                "In this regard, the Court would recall that all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have damaging effects, resulting in a deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities (see Csüllög v. Hungary, cited above, § 30, with further references). Considering the duration of the regime imposed on the applicant and the very limited possibilities available to him for physical movement and social contact, the Court has no doubt that the lack of any meaningful response to his repeated complaints about his solitude and exclusion must have caused him feelings of humiliation and helplessness (see also paragraph 82 above)."

Moreover, in contrast to a personal check, which the authorities are expressly obliged to carry out pursuant to Article 212b § 1(5), putting joined shackles on a detainee should be limited only to “particularly justified cases” (see paragraph 106 above). It does not appear that there was a permanent need to do so in the applicant’s case, given that in the prison he remained in a secure environment and other means of direct and indirect control of his behaviour were at the same time applied (see paragraphs 107-108 and 112-117 above)."
            ],
            [
                "175. The Court has even more grave misgivings in respect of the personal check to which the applicant was likewise subjected daily, or even several times a day, whenever he left or entered his cell. The strip-search, involving an anal inspection, was carried out as a matter of routine and was not linked to any concrete security needs, nor to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant’s conduct. It was performed despite the fact that outside his cell and the “N” ward the applicant could move around the remand centre only by himself, his mobility was restricted due to his wearing joined shackles on hands and feet all the time and he had to be permanently and directly supervised by at least 2 prison guards. In addition, as already mentioned above, his behaviour in the cell, including his use of sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via close-circuit television (see paragraphs (76, 77, 82, 106-108, 110 and 112-117 above).",
                "In this connection, the Court would again refer to the CPT report of 2009 in which it expressed its considerable concern about the practice of strip-searches applied to persons classified as dangerous detainees, in the following way: “[t]he CPT also has serious misgivings about the systematic practice of obliging “N” status prisoners to undergo routine strip-searches whenever entering or leaving their cells. The prisoners concerned had to undress completely, and squat fully naked in view of the guards and any prisoner(s) sharing the cell while their clothes were examined. In the CPT’s opinion, such a practice could be considered amounting to degrading treatment.” (see paragraphs 131-132 above)."

Poland, no 25196/94, 15 November 2001, § 59; and Van der Ven, cited above, § 60, with further references). However, it is not persuaded by the Government’s argument that such systematic, intrusive and exceptionally embarrassing checks performed on the applicant daily, or even several times a day, were necessary to ensure safety in prison (see paragraph 149 above). Nor does it share their view that the absence of an intention to humiliate the applicant on the part of the authorities justified that treatment (see paragraph 160 above ).",

            [
                "177. Lastly, the Court would add that due to the strict, rigid rules for the imposition of the special regime and the vaguely defined “exceptional circumstances” justifying its discontinuation laid down in Article 212a § 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, the authorities, in extending that regime, were not in fact obliged to consider any changes in the applicant’s personal situation and, in particular, the combined effects of the continued application of the impugned measures (see paragraphs 105 and 168 above). Those rules – and this was also noted by the CPT – do not provide for adequate solutions enabling the authorities, if necessary, to adjust the regime to individual conduct or to reduce the negative impact of social isolation (see paragraphs 105-108 and 129-130 above).",
                "In the present case the authorities did not ever refer to any likelihood of the applicant’s escaping in the event of his being detained under a less strict regime. However, neither the apparent absence of such risk, nor the adverse emotional and mental effects of isolation as alleged by the applicant, were considered circumstances sufficient to justify lifting any of the strict measures applied under the regime (see paragraphs 81-84 above). In that context, the Court would again recall that, as stated above (see paragraph 165 above), in cases involving solitary confinement the authorities should act with special caution in imposing that measure and should examine carefully all the specific circumstances militating for or against its continuation.",
                "In contrast, it emerges from the authorities’ decisions that, apart from the original grounds based essentially on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant, including “the suspicion that he had a very high rank in organised crime structures” and “displayed a serious lack of moral character” they found or considered any other reasons for classifying the applicant as a “dangerous detainee” (see paragraphs 75, 81 and 83 above). While, as said above, those circumstances could initially warrant the imposition of the “N” regime on the applicant (see paragraphs 169-170 above), they could not suffice as a sole justification for its prolonged continuation. As pointed out by the applicant and the third party (see paragraphs 140 and 155 above), with the passage of time the quarterly procedure for review of his “dangerous detainee” status became a pure formality limited to a repetition of the same grounds in each successive decision."

While the latter ground seems to have no relevance for denying contact with the applicant’s child, who obviously had nothing to do with the proceedings against the applicant, the reliance on “the child’s interest” can be considered to fall within “the protection of the rights ... of others” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2.",

                "The Court therefore accepts that, given that the applicant’s common-law wife was charged and then indicted in the same proceedings, the authorities had to restrict their contact to secure the process of obtaining evidence. At the initial stage of the procedure even the resort to a total prohibition of communication could be considered necessary for achieving the aim sought by the authorities, although it inevitably resulted in harsh consequences for the applicant’s family life. However, with the passage of time and having regard to the stringency of the measure, as well as the authorities’ general obligation to enable the applicant to have contact with the family during his detention (see paragraph 212 above), the situation called for a careful review of the necessity of keeping him in complete isolation from his common-law wife (see Bagiński, cited above, § 96).",
                "It is to be noted that for two years and three months the applicant had only one 60-minute long conversation with A.W., which took place at the beginning of his detention, on 8 January 2007 (see paragraphs 63-64, 70 and 213 above). At the same time, visits from his child were first refused and then limited (see paragraphs 54-62, 70 and 213 above) and contact with his mother was likewise restricted (see paragraphs 65-67 and 70 above). In addition, as established above, the applicant was placed in a solitary cell for the most part of his detention (see paragraphs 76, 80 and 166 above). In the circumstances, the authorities could not have been unaware that the prolonged and absolute ban on the applicant’s contact with his common-wife must have had a particularly serious and negative impact on his family life. Despite that, throughout the entire period they never considered any alternative means of ensuring that the applicant’s contact with A.W. would not lead to any collusive action on their part or otherwise obstruct the proceedings against them. Such alterative solutions are explicitly provided for by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences. If the authorities were convinced that an “open visit” enabling the applicant direct physical contact and unrestricted conversation with A.W. could not be allowed for the sake of the interests of the proceedings, they had a choice between, for instance, subjection of their contact to supervision by a prison guard, i.e. a “supervised visit” and granting a “close visit” without the possibility of direct contact. It was open to them to impose other specific conditions on the nature, frequency and length of visits (see paragraphs 118-119 above). In consequence, having regard to the considerable duration and severity of the restrictions, the Court concludes that they went beyond what could be regarded as necessary in a democratic society “for the prevention of disorder and crime”."

                "221. It remains for the Court to ascertain whether the limitations imposed on the applicant’s contact with his son were justified under Article 8 in terms of their necessity.",
                "The Court agrees that, considering the age of the child at the relevant time (see paragraph 54 above), the authorities needed to ensure that he was accompanied by an adult third party who also had to be eligible for visit permission. By the nature of things, visits from children or, more generally, minor persons in prison require special arrangements and may be subjected to particular conditions depending on their age, the possible effects on their emotional state or well-being and on the personal circumstances of a visited person. Since the applicant was classified as a “dangerous detainee”, the authorities had to take this factor into account in deciding on the form of his contact with the son. Some restrictions were therefore inevitable. However, as apparently the suitable third party offered to assist the applicant’s son during visits and there was no indication that visits in prison actually had, or might have had, any adverse effects on the child (see paragraphs 55-61 above), all the circumstances taken together did not justify the blanket refusal of visit permissions for some 9 months in 2006-2007 and, subsequently, for 2 months between October and December 2007. For that reason, the Court sees no force in the Government’s arguments as to the necessity of the restrictions. Indeed, it finds it inconceivable that, provided that the appropriate arrangements for security were made, allowing the applicant to have contact with his infant child could upset security in prison or the proper course of the proceedings against him. Nor does the Court find that, as the Government argued (see paragraph 211 above), the fact that at a later stage the ban on the family visits was lifted and regular contact resumed, could sufficiently alleviate the consequences of the earlier, strict measures."

There should instead be a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities, and educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with \"N\" status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day.

In the CPT’s opinion, the procedure for allocating a prisoner to ‘N’ status should be refined to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream of the prison population are accorded this status. Reviews of ‘N’ status should specify clearly what is to be done to assist the prisoner concerned to move away from the ‘N’ status and provide clear criteria for assessing development.

It was enough, as had happened in his case, to rely on a mere suspicion that he had committed an offence in an organised criminal group to classify him as such and simply extend the regime “automatically” every three months when his situation had been reviewed. The law set no time-limit for the application of the measure, allowing the authorities to extend it indefinitely. Pursuant to Article 7 of the Code, in his appeal he could only contest the lawfulness of the decision on classification. In consequence, it had been legally and practically impossible for him to contest in any meaningful way the continuation of the regime on the grounds given by the Penitentiary Commission because any extension had been lawful as long as the charge involving organised crime had been maintained.

To begin with, all his movements in the cell had been constantly monitored, including his dressing, undressing, washing and physiological functions. The very fact that he could be watched by third parties in the toilet, no matter whether the images included all details, had reduced him to an object and stripped him of his dignity.",

He could only have a solitary walk in the prison yard. Despite his numerous complaints about excessive isolation, the authorities had placed another inmate in his cell only for short periods. They had refused all his repeated requests to give him any unpaid work in the prison, to enable him to take part in training or workshops or even to learn foreign languages with the help of his own CDs.

In their submission, solitary confinement normally constituted a form of punishment, considered by some to be even a psychological torture, and meant that the person concerned was prevented from any contact with other people, including the prison staff. However, a cell for a dangerous detainee was simply a cell with higher-level security standards which differed from cells for ordinary inmates.",

The check had comprised an inspection of the body orifices and hollows because these were the places in which detainees would usually smuggle prohibited items. The main aim of such checks was to ensure safety in prison. All the checks had been performed with due respect for the applicant’s dignity and had not been intended to humiliate him in any way.

For that reason, the applicant had had to wear joined shackles outside his cell, including during his appearances before the court and his visit to the Lublin Civil Hospital. That visit had been limited to a medical examination and had not involved a longer stay. The applicant had not suffered any bodily injury through wearing the shackles.

Italy (no. 56317/00, of 10 November 2005) in which the Court had found no violation of Article 3 on account of the 12-year long imposition of the special regime on a mafia member, holding that the continued application of similar restrictions had not been disproportionate since the need to maintain them had been justified. This conclusion was valid in the circumstances of the present case, in particular as the need to apply the regime to the applicant had been constantly confirmed by the decisions of the Penitentiary Commission, which had examined the matter every 3 months."

In this connection, it pointed out that while there were differences among special security regimes across the respondent States, some general conclusions could be drawn from the relevant judgments. As the Court had stated on many occasions, conditions of detention might amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. In their assessment, account had to be taken of the stringency of the measure, its duration, the objectives pursued and the cumulative effects on the person concerned.",
                "In the above cases the Court had paid special attention to the duration of the measures imposed under high security regimes and had held solitary confinement, even in cases entailing only relative isolation, could not be imposed on a prisoner indefinitely. Moreover, it was essential that the prisoner should be able to have an independent judicial authority review the merits and reasons for a prolonged measure of solitary confinement. The authorities should carry out a reassessment that took into account any changes in the prisoner’s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons needed to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time had gone by ( Ramirez Sanchez v. France, §§ 139 and 145).",

It also accepted that the protection of society and security of a remand centre, as stipulated in the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, could be considered legitimate aims justifying such stringent measures. Nevertheless, there were several aspects of the regime that gave rise to a serous concern and whose compatibility with Article 3 of the Convention was open to doubt.",

In this regard, the third party relied on the CPT report on its 2004 visit in Poland and its conclusion that “regardless of the gravity of the offences of which prisoners [were] accused or ... convicted and/or their presumed dangerousness, efforts must be made to provide them with appropriate stimulation and, in particular, with adequate human contact”. This conclusion was prompted by the finding that dangerous detainees’ activities had been subject to strict limitations, such as one hour of outdoor exercise per day taken alone or in the company of a cellmate (if any), a weekly visit of 1 to 2 hours to a recreation room and restricted visits from the family.",
                "Moreover, the regime was in general applied for too long and too frequently without sufficient grounds. A review procedure was not based on the proper re-assessment of the situation either. In practice, it turned into a pure formality – a repetition of the same general reasons in each subsequent decision extending the application of the measure. Polish scientific research carried out in relation to the application of the “dangerous detainee” status revealed that reasons given by the Penitentiary Commissions were either general and superficial like the “serious lack of moral character” or illogical like “the “participation in the [prison] subculture” (an activity which could not, by the nature of things, be undertaken by a person isolated from other inmates)."

Their contact with their family members, other prisoners and even with the prison staff was strictly controlled. Their physical, cultural, educational and other activities were seriously limited. In addition, outside their cells they had to wear “joined shackles” and every time they left and entered their cells they were subjected to a routine personal check, during which they had to strip naked in front of prison guards and carry out deep knee-bends. Their cells were constantly monitored via close-circuit television and regularly searched by the guards. Given the degree of isolation and severity of restrictions under the “N” regime, there was an immense difference in comparison to the ordinary prison regime.

However, these details did not concern the core aspects of the special prison regime imposed on him (see paragraphs 72-86 above).",

The measures involved his segregation from the prison community except for some periods when he had an inmate in his cell, and limitations on contact with his family together with special arrangements for family visits. Also, every time he left or entered his cell he was subjected to a routine “personal check” – a strip-search, including a thorough inspection of his body and clothes and requiring him to strip naked and make deep knee bends in order to enable an examination of his anus (see paragraphs 75-84 and 105-117 above)."

The Court notes that the applicant first referred to the quality of the law which governed the special regime, submitting that the relevant statutory grounds set out in Articles 212a and 212b of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences were vague and general. He stressed that a mere suspicion that he had committed an offence in an organised criminal group had sufficed to classify him as a “dangerous detainee” and extend continually the imposition of the regime (see paragraph 140 above).",
                "Indeed, pursuant to Article 212a § 3, if a detainee is suspected of an organised-crime offence, the authorities have to apply the regime and, consequently, all the security measures enumerated in Article 212b, unless particular circumstances militate against this (see paragraphs 105 and 106 above). The legal formulation of the rule and exception to it could, in the Court’s view, generally result in an over-inclusive regime. This conclusion goes hand in hand with the findings of the 2009 CPT report, which underlined that the procedure for allocating a prisoner to “N” status fails to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream prison population are accorded this status (see paragraph 130 above). Also, given the absence of any provisions linking that status with a person’s actual behaviour in prison, the legal framework of the “N” regime seems to be too rigid and not sufficiently oriented towards individual circumstances of a particular detainee.",

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that while the applicant was charged with and then convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and obtaining a loan by deception, as well as acting in an organised criminal group, he has never been convicted of any violent crime (see paragraphs 8, 24, 31-32 and 75 above). Nevertheless, the Court accepts that the initial decision of 12 October 2007 imposing the “N” regime on the applicant already at the pre-conviction stage was legitimate. In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable on the part of the authorities to consider that, for the sake of ensuring safety in prison, he should be subjected to tighter security controls, involving increased and constant supervision of his movements within and outside his cell, limitations on his contact and communication with the outside world and some form of segregation from the prison community.",
                "As the Court has already held in similar cases concerning organised crime, in particular those lodged by persons linked to Mafia-type organisations, the existing, continuing danger that an applicant may re ‑ establish contact with criminal organisations is an element that may justify applying even harsh isolation measures in order to exclude such a possibility (see, for instance, Messina (no. 2) (dec.), cited above). In the applicant’s case that possibility had to be taken into account.",
                "Also, the monitoring of a detainee’s behaviour via close-circuit television at all times, as in the present case, although certainly intrusive, is not per se incompatible with Article 3. This measure serves the purposes of both ensuring prison security and protecting the detainee himself from the risk of pressure or even physical attack by the criminal community which, in the context of organised crime, cannot be excluded."

However, for the reasons stated below, the Court cannot accept that the continued, routine and indiscriminate application of the full range of measures that the authorities were obliged to apply under the “N” regime for two years and nine months was necessary for maintaining prison security and compatible with Article 3 of the Convention."

It is true, as the Government pointed out (see paragraphs 145-148 above), that although the applicant was held in a solitary cell at a special high-security ward separated from the rest of the prison, he was not subjected to complete sensory or social isolation as there were three periods, each lasting around six weeks, during which he had another cellmate placed with him. He maintained a degree of daily contact with the prison staff, even if only limited, for the sake of a daily walk (see paragraphs 107-108 and 146 above). He also received family visits, had meetings with his lawyers (see paragraphs 54-71 above) and had access to the television and prison library (see paragraph 146 above). Accordingly, he was not subjected to total isolation but rather to a limited social isolation (see Messina (no. 2) (dec.), cited above; and Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 135).",
                "The list of visits received by the applicant in detention shows that, up to 19 January 2010, he had had 147 visits altogether, out of which 102 took place after the special regime was imposed on him (see paragraphs 68-71 above). The number of family visits over that period stood at 45 and the remaining were meetings with his lawyers or other meetings connected with the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 71 above). This, even considering that the visits were spread over more than two years, must have attenuated, at least to some extent, the consequences of the separation from others and daily solitude for the applicant’s mental and emotional well ‑ being.",

As the CPT pointed out in its two reports of 2004 and 2009, not only was the regime itself very restrictive but also the Polish authorities in general failed to provide “N” ward inmates with appropriate stimulation and, in particular, with adequate human contact (see paragraphs 129-132 and 155 above). In the 2009 report the authorities were explicitly criticised for not having developed “a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities”. It was recommended that “educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with “N” status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day” (see paragraph 129 above). The CPT also pointed out that “placement in an “N” unit should not be a purely passive response to the prisoner’s attitude and behaviour” (see paragraph 130 above)."

Throughout his confinement in the high-security ward the applicant made numerous – but never successful – requests to the prison authorities, asking them to enable him to take part in any training, workshops, courses or any sports activities organised for ordinary inmates or to give him any unpaid work. No such activity was made available to him. In reaction to his complaints that isolation from other people was putting an exceptionally severe strain on him, the authorities said that the need to socialise with others was not a ground for qualifying for participation in activities in prison (see paragraphs 84-85 above). They were similarly inflexible when he asked for permission to have in his cell his own sports equipment, computer games, CD ‑ player and CDs with foreign language courses and music (see paragraph 84 above), even though such a minor concession could by no means threaten prison safety.",
                "In this regard, the Court would recall that all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have damaging effects, resulting in a deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities (see Csüllög v. Hungary, cited above, § 30, with further references). Considering the duration of the regime imposed on the applicant and the very limited possibilities available to him for physical movement and social contact, the Court has no doubt that the lack of any meaningful response to his repeated complaints about his solitude and exclusion must have caused him feelings of humiliation and helplessness (see also paragraph 82 above)."

Moreover, in contrast to a personal check, which the authorities are expressly obliged to carry out pursuant to Article 212b § 1(5), putting joined shackles on a detainee should be limited only to “particularly justified cases” (see paragraph 106 above). It does not appear that there was a permanent need to do so in the applicant’s case, given that in the prison he remained in a secure environment and other means of direct and indirect control of his behaviour were at the same time applied (see paragraphs 107-108 and 112-117 above)."

                "175. The Court has even more grave misgivings in respect of the personal check to which the applicant was likewise subjected daily, or even several times a day, whenever he left or entered his cell. The strip-search, involving an anal inspection, was carried out as a matter of routine and was not linked to any concrete security needs, nor to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant’s conduct. It was performed despite the fact that outside his cell and the “N” ward the applicant could move around the remand centre only by himself, his mobility was restricted due to his wearing joined shackles on hands and feet all the time and he had to be permanently and directly supervised by at least 2 prison guards. In addition, as already mentioned above, his behaviour in the cell, including his use of sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via close-circuit television (see paragraphs (76, 77, 82, 106-108, 110 and 112-117 above).",
                "In this connection, the Court would again refer to the CPT report of 2009 in which it expressed its considerable concern about the practice of strip-searches applied to persons classified as dangerous detainees, in the following way: “[t]he CPT also has serious misgivings about the systematic practice of obliging “N” status prisoners to undergo routine strip-searches whenever entering or leaving their cells. The prisoners concerned had to undress completely, and squat fully naked in view of the guards and any prisoner(s) sharing the cell while their clothes were examined. In the CPT’s opinion, such a practice could be considered amounting to degrading treatment.” (see paragraphs 131-132 above)."

Poland, no 25196/94, 15 November 2001, § 59; and Van der Ven, cited above, § 60, with further references). However, it is not persuaded by the Government’s argument that such systematic, intrusive and exceptionally embarrassing checks performed on the applicant daily, or even several times a day, were necessary to ensure safety in prison (see paragraph 149 above). Nor does it share their view that the absence of an intention to humiliate the applicant on the part of the authorities justified that treatment (see paragraph 160 above ).",
                "Having regard to the fact that the applicant was already subjected in addition to several other strict surveillance measures, that the authorities did not rely on any concrete convincing security needs and that, despite the serious charge against him, he apparently did not display any disruptive, violent or otherwise dangerous behaviour in the remand centre, the Court considers that the practice of daily strip-searches applied to him for two years and nine months must have diminished his human dignity and caused him feelings of inferiority, anguish and accumulated distress which went beyond the unavoidable suffering and humiliation involved in the imposition of detention on remand (see Van der Ven, cited above, § 62 and paragraph 160 above)."

            [
                "177. Lastly, the Court would add that due to the strict, rigid rules for the imposition of the special regime and the vaguely defined “exceptional circumstances” justifying its discontinuation laid down in Article 212a § 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, the authorities, in extending that regime, were not in fact obliged to consider any changes in the applicant’s personal situation and, in particular, the combined effects of the continued application of the impugned measures (see paragraphs 105 and 168 above). Those rules – and this was also noted by the CPT – do not provide for adequate solutions enabling the authorities, if necessary, to adjust the regime to individual conduct or to reduce the negative impact of social isolation (see paragraphs 105-108 and 129-130 above).",
                "In the present case the authorities did not ever refer to any likelihood of the applicant’s escaping in the event of his being detained under a less strict regime. However, neither the apparent absence of such risk, nor the adverse emotional and mental effects of isolation as alleged by the applicant, were considered circumstances sufficient to justify lifting any of the strict measures applied under the regime (see paragraphs 81-84 above). In that context, the Court would again recall that, as stated above (see paragraph 165 above), in cases involving solitary confinement the authorities should act with special caution in imposing that measure and should examine carefully all the specific circumstances militating for or against its continuation.",
                "In contrast, it emerges from the authorities’ decisions that, apart from the original grounds based essentially on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant, including “the suspicion that he had a very high rank in organised crime structures” and “displayed a serious lack of moral character” they found or considered any other reasons for classifying the applicant as a “dangerous detainee” (see paragraphs 75, 81 and 83 above). While, as said above, those circumstances could initially warrant the imposition of the “N” regime on the applicant (see paragraphs 169-170 above), they could not suffice as a sole justification for its prolonged continuation. As pointed out by the applicant and the third party (see paragraphs 140 and 155 above), with the passage of time the quarterly procedure for review of his “dangerous detainee” status became a pure formality limited to a repetition of the same grounds in each successive decision."

At the initial stage of the procedure even the resort to a total prohibition of communication could be considered necessary for achieving the aim sought by the authorities, although it inevitably resulted in harsh consequences for the applicant’s family life. However, with the passage of time and having regard to the stringency of the measure, as well as the authorities’ general obligation to enable the applicant to have contact with the family during his detention (see paragraph 212 above), the situation called for a careful review of the necessity of keeping him in complete isolation from his common-law wife (see Bagiński, cited above, § 96).",
                "It is to be noted that for two years and three months the applicant had only one 60-minute long conversation with A.W., which took place at the beginning of his detention, on 8 January 2007 (see paragraphs 63-64, 70 and 213 above). At the same time, visits from his child were first refused and then limited (see paragraphs 54-62, 70 and 213 above) and contact with his mother was likewise restricted (see paragraphs 65-67 and 70 above). In addition, as established above, the applicant was placed in a solitary cell for the most part of his detention (see paragraphs 76, 80 and 166 above). In the circumstances, the authorities could not have been unaware that the prolonged and absolute ban on the applicant’s contact with his common-wife must have had a particularly serious and negative impact on his family life. Despite that, throughout the entire period they never considered any alternative means of ensuring that the applicant’s contact with A.W. would not lead to any collusive action on their part or otherwise obstruct the proceedings against them. Such alterative solutions are explicitly provided for by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences. If the authorities were convinced that an “open visit” enabling the applicant direct physical contact and unrestricted conversation with A.W. could not be allowed for the sake of the interests of the proceedings, they had a choice between, for instance, subjection of their contact to supervision by a prison guard, i.e. a “supervised visit” and granting a “close visit” without the possibility of direct contact. It was open to them to impose other specific conditions on the nature, frequency and length of visits (see paragraphs 118-119 above). In consequence, having regard to the considerable duration and severity of the restrictions, the Court concludes that they went beyond what could be regarded as necessary in a democratic society “for the prevention of disorder and crime”."

                "The Court agrees that, considering the age of the child at the relevant time (see paragraph 54 above), the authorities needed to ensure that he was accompanied by an adult third party who also had to be eligible for visit permission. By the nature of things, visits from children or, more generally, minor persons in prison require special arrangements and may be subjected to particular conditions depending on their age, the possible effects on their emotional state or well-being and on the personal circumstances of a visited person. Since the applicant was classified as a “dangerous detainee”, the authorities had to take this factor into account in deciding on the form of his contact with the son. Some restrictions were therefore inevitable. However, as apparently the suitable third party offered to assist the applicant’s son during visits and there was no indication that visits in prison actually had, or might have had, any adverse effects on the child (see paragraphs 55-61 above), all the circumstances taken together did not justify the blanket refusal of visit permissions for some 9 months in 2006-2007 and, subsequently, for 2 months between October and December 2007. For that reason, the Court sees no force in the Government’s arguments as to the necessity of the restrictions. Indeed, it finds it inconceivable that, provided that the appropriate arrangements for security were made, allowing the applicant to have contact with his infant child could upset security in prison or the proper course of the proceedings against him. Nor does the Court find that, as the Government argued (see paragraph 211 above), the fact that at a later stage the ban on the family visits was lifted and regular contact resumed, could sufficiently alleviate the consequences of the earlier, strict measures."

For that reason the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. The Court has many times stressed the importance of a prisoner’s right to communicate with counsel out of earshot of the prison authority. By analogy, the same applies to the authorities involved in the proceedings against him. Indeed, if a lawyer were unable to confer with his client without such surveillance and receive confidential instructions from him, his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective. It is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client if their correspondence is susceptible to routine scrutiny by individuals or authorities who may have a direct interest in the subject matter contained therein.",

Nor does there appear to have been any other exceptional circumstances justifying the interference with the privileged correspondence.

It has thus observed that complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation, can destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason ( see Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], no. 59450/00, §§ 120 to 124, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and the authorities cited therein). In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness, substantive reasons must be given when a protracted period of solitary confinement is extended. The decision should thus make it possible to establish that the authorities have carried out a reassessment that takes into account any changes in the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons will need to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time goes by. Furthermore, such measures, which are a form of “imprisonment within the prison”, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006.

In the absence of reasoning, the impugned restriction must have been perceived as arbitrary. Arbitrary restrictive measures applied to vulnerable individuals like prisoners inevitably contribute to the feeling of subordination, total dependence, powerlessness and, consequently, humiliation. The authorities did not apply any measures to counter the negative effects of protracted solitary confinement on the applicant ’ s physical and mental condition. In the Court ’ s view, open air stays or sport opportunities, of limited availability, cannot under the present circumstances be considered as capable of remedying those negative effects, especially since all the movements of the applicant entailed handcuffing in an otherwise secure environment."

This group of prisoners will (or at least should, if the classification system is operating satisfactorily) represent a very small proportion of the overall prison population. However, it is a group that is of particular concern to the CPT, in view of the fact that the need to take exceptional measures concerning such prisoners brings with it a greater risk of inhuman treatment than is the case with the average prisoner.",

Human dignity is to be respected notwithstanding criminality or dangerousness and if human persons have to be imprisoned in circumstances of greater severity than the conventional, every effort should be made, subject to the requirements of safe custody, good order and security and the requirements of community well-being, to ensure that living environment and conditions offset the deleterious effects – decreased mental efficiency, depression, anxiety, aggressiveness, neurosis, negative values, altered biorhythms – of the severer custodial situation. In the most serious instances prisoners regress to a merely vegetative life. Generally the impairment may be reversible but if imprisonment, especially in maximum security, is prolonged, perception of time and space and self can be permanently and seriously impaired – ‘ annihilation of personality ’ .”",

The CPT calls upon the Hungarian authorities to take steps to implement its previous recommendations concerning the provision to prisoners placed in a Grade 4 regime of written information on the reasons for the measure as well as the opportunity to express their views on the matter. It is equally important to provide such prisoners with written information on the possibilities to contest the decision.

The CPT must reiterate its view that there can be no justification for routinely handcuffing prisoners outside their cells, all the more so when this measure is applied in an already secure environment.

As regards the handcuffing of prisoners during medical consultations, in the CPT ’ s view, such a practice infringes upon the dignity of the prisoners concerned and prohibits the development of a proper doctor-patient relationship (and is possibly detrimental to the establishment of an objective medical finding). The CPT calls upon the Hungarian authorities to review without further delay their current policy with regard to the application of means of restraint to prisoners placed under a special security regime (Grade 4 prisoners).”",

Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with this provision the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well ‑ being are adequately secured (see Kudła v.

As stated by the CPT, however, all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have damaging effects, resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities (see Iorgov v.

France [GC], no. 59450/00, §§ 120 to 124, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and the authorities cited therein). In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness, substantive reasons must be given when a protracted period of solitary confinement is extended. The decision should thus make it possible to establish that the authorities have carried out a reassessment that takes into account any changes in the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons will need to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time goes by. Furthermore, such measures, which are a form of “imprisonment within the prison”, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006.

Moreover, he served almost the entirety of his prison time in the “KBK” regime, entailing very harsh conditions including only artificial light in his cell, insufficient ventilation, a toilet without a seat or a cover as well as full cavity searches on a daily basis (see paragraphs 9 and 13 to 16 above).

Italy (no. 2) ( dec. ), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999– V).

In the absence of reasoning, the impugned restriction must have been perceived as arbitrary. Arbitrary restrictive measures applied to vulnerable individuals like prisoners inevitably contribute to the feeling of subordination, total dependence, powerlessness and, consequently, humiliation. The authorities did not apply any measures to counter the negative effects of protracted solitary confinement on the applicant ’ s physical and mental condition. In the Court ’ s view, open air stays or sport opportunities, of limited availability, cannot under the present circumstances be considered as capable of remedying those negative effects, especially since all the movements of the applicant entailed handcuffing in an otherwise secure environment."

In these circumstances, it cannot exercise a substantive review that is required for an effective remedy to be provided by a competent national authority to comply with Article 13.

It was a cell intended for inmates in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure or for inmates accused of pedophilia or rape. While in that cell the applicant was deprived of any contact with other inmates and of any social activity.

Whilst the latter can take daily exercise in an inner courtyard adjoining their cell and, depending on the circumstances, may be allowed limited contact with prisoners from the same unit, the applicant was deprived of such possibilities.

In that connection the length of the period in question requires careful examination by the Court as to its justification, the need for the measures taken and their proportionality with regard to other possible restrictions, the guarantees offered to the applicant to avoid arbitrariness and the measures taken by the authorities to satisfy themselves that the applicant’s physical and psychological condition allowed him to remain in isolation (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 136)."

Furthermore, where the distinction in question operates in this intimate and vulnerable sphere of an individual’s private life, particularly weighty reasons have to be advanced before the Court to justify the measure complained of. Where a difference of treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation, the margin of appreciation afforded to the State is narrow, and in such situations the principle of proportionality does not only require that the measure chosen be generally adapted to the objective pursued; it must also be shown that it was necessary in the circumstances. If the reasons advanced for a difference in treatment were based solely on the applicant’s sexual orientation, this would amount to discrimination under the Convention (see Alekseyev, cited above, § 102)."

                "b) Governments should develop and implement alternative measures with a variety and a flexibility that allow for an adjustment of the measure to the individual capacities and abilities of the child in order to avoid the use of judicial proceedings. Children with disabilities in conflict with the law should be dealt with as much as possible without resorting to formal/legal procedures. Such procedures should only be considered when necessary in the interest of public order. In those cases special efforts have to be made to inform the child about the juvenile justice procedure and his or her rights therein;",
                "c) Children with disabilities in conflict with the law should not be placed in a regular juvenile detention centre by way of pre-trial detention nor by way of a punishment. Deprivation of liberty should only be applied if necessary with a view to providing the child with adequate treatment for addressing his or her problems which have resulted in the commission of a crime and the child should be placed in an institution that has the specially trained staff and other facilities to provide this specific treatment. In making such decisions the competent authority should make sure that the human rights and legal safeguards are fully respected. ”"

Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Varnava and Others v.

Since the applicant was released from the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on 23 March 2005, he had at that time only the State to protect his interests.

Hence, it appears from the grandfather’s letter of 30 November 2005 to a Deputy Prosecutor General that he had been informed that his complaint of 4 October 2005 to the Prosecutor General had been sent to various prosecutors’ offices. Moreover, in his letter of 30 November 2005, the grandfather did indeed repeat the complaints regarding the applicant’s treatment in the temporary detention centre and his poor health which he had already set out in his previous letter of 4 October 2005 (see paragraph 46 above). The Court notes that the prosecutor’s reply of 9 November 2005 and the regional prosecutor’s reply of 16 December 2005 nevertheless contained no information in response to the grandfather’s complaints concerning the applicant’s medical condition or the authorities’ failure to treat him while in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders."

Furthermore, the Court has regard to the fact that, once reinstated as the applicant’s guardian, the grandfather pursued the matter of the legality of the applicant’s detention and, within the framework of those proceedings, raised the issue of the applicant’s frail health and the lack of medical treatment. In particular, in the complaint against the decision of 21 February 2005, which was examined by the President of the Novosibirsk Regional Court on 29 May 2006, the grandfather cited the applicant’s diagnosis and the impossibility for him of being detained in the absence of medical advice. The President of the Regional Court responded in its judgment that the fact that the applicant suffered from various illnesses could not serve as a ground for quashing the decision of 21 February 2005, given that it had already been enforced in March 2005."

Against this background the Court finds that, in the absence of any answer from the prosecutors’ offices to the grandfather’s complaints in October and November 2005, the grandfather, once reinstated as the applicant’s guardian, used other possible avenues to argue the applicant’s case pertaining to his poor health and the lack of medical treatment in the temporary detention centre. Since the only concrete answer he received to that complaint was through the judgment of 29 May 2006 when, in essence, he was told that there was no point in complaining any further as the applicant’s detention had already ended, the Court considers that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the six-month period should be calculated from that date, as further complaints to the authorities would have had no prospects of success. Noting that the application was lodged with the Court on 1 November 2006, it follows that the applicant’s complaints under Article 3 fall within the six-month time-limit."

The first of these – the pre-investigation inquiry, conducted in accordance with Chapters 19 and 20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – was to verify information on an alleged crime and decide whether there was sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed and whether to institute criminal proceedings. The second set – the proceedings deciding on the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre, conducted in accordance with Chapter 3.1 of the Minors Act – did not require a pre-investigation inquiry to be conducted and were not limited in scope to information obtained during the inquiry. Thus, the outcome of the first set of proceedings did not, in itself, constitute a decisive ground for initiating the second set of proceedings, as exemplified in the applicant’s case where only the last two inquiries, out of five, had been followed by the second set of proceedings for his placement in the temporary detention centre, and then because it had become obvious that other preventive measures had been unsuccessful. Hence, the Government found no grounds for treating the two sets of proceedings as a single process, as the Chamber had done in its judgment, and argued that the applicant’s complaints under Article 6 should be examined separately in respect of each set of proceedings in question."

The District Court referred at length to the witness statements made by S. and his mother in its judgment, and relied on those and the pre-investigation inquiry’s findings when making its ruling (see paragraph 27 above).

Moreover, the Chamber observed that the normal time-limit for storage of medical records was ten years in the Russian Federation.

The Mental Disability Advocacy Center (“the MDAC”) stressed that children with mental disabilities faced a “double disadvantage” – both as children and as individuals with mental disabilities. These children were particularly vulnerable to violations of their rights and had additional needs which had to be protected through stringent and effective safeguards. The MDAC referred to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (adopted on 13 December 2006, UNTS 2515 – “the CRPD”) and in particular its main object to ensure equality and non-discrimination in all domains (Article 5 § 2). It further referred to the CRC, emphasising that the best interests of the child should always be a primary consideration and that States Parties undertook to ensure the child such protection and care as was necessary for his or her well-being (Article 3 – see paragraph 81 above). Moreover, Article 23 of the CRC specifically related to children with disabilities and the MDAC observed that the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its General Comment No. 9 (2006), set out further guidance as to the treatment of children with disabilities in conflict with the law. Thus, the Committee stated that “children with disabilities in conflict with the law should not be placed in a regular juvenile detention centre by way of pre-trial detention nor by way of a punishment” (see paragraph 83 above). The MDAC emphasised that the Court had held that States had an obligation to take particular measures to provide effective protection of vulnerable persons from ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (they referred to Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001-V)."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 201, ECHR 2012). However, to come within the scope of the prohibition contained in Article 3, the treatment inflicted on or endured by the victim must reach a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is a relative one, depending on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see M.S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24527/08, § 38, 3 May 2012, and Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, § 24, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII)."

The Court reiterates that the mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 116, 29 November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee’s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention (see Khudobin, cited above, § 83 ), that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, § § 104-06, 28 March 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 115), and that, where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee’s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Popov, cited above, § 211; Hummatov, cited above, §§ 109 and 114; and Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, § 93, 27 November 2014 ). The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Holomiov v. Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 117, 7 November 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 116). Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Cara-Damiani v. Italy, no. 2447/05, § 66, 7 February 2012)."

Russia, no. 46468/06, § 140, 22 December 2008). When dealing with children, the Court considers that, in line with established international law, the health of juveniles deprived of their liberty shall be safeguarded according to recognised medical standards applicable to juveniles in the wider community (see, for example, Rules 57, 62.2, 62.5, 69.2, and 73 (d) of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures, Article 3 § 3 of the CRC, and Rules 49-53 of the Havana Rules in paragraphs 79, 81 and 87 above). The authorities should always be guided by the child’s best interests, and the child should be guaranteed proper care and protection. Moreover, if the authorities are considering depriving a child of his or her liberty, a medical assessment should be made of the child’s state of health to determine whether or not he or she can be placed in a juvenile detention centre."

                "139. The Court further stresses that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, with further references; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 121, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; Amirov, cited above, § 80; and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 121, 10 January 2012)."

In this connection it should be noted that the Court has held that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation). According to the Court’s case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, damage and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Amirov, cited above, § 92 ). In the absence of such an explanation the Court can draw inferences that may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see, for instance, Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 274, 18 June 2002, and Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, § 161, 5 June 2012).",

Moreover, as concerns the report by the head of the temporary detention centre, dated 28 December 2010, and the explanation of a supervisor at the centre, dated 23 December 2010, the Court finds it unlikely that they would remember whether or not one child, who had stayed at the temporary detention centre for thirty days almost six years earlier, had complained of the conditions or access to the toilets.

In particular, it finds it established through the medical certificates submitted by the applicant that he was examined by a neurologist and a psychiatrist on 27 December 2004 and 19 January 2005, that is, only slightly over a month before being placed in the temporary detention centre. At that time, medication was prescribed for him, as well as regular supervision by a neurologist and a psychiatrist and regular psychological counselling for his ADHD. It has further been established through medical records that the applicant was hospitalised the day after his release from the temporary detention centre and treated for neurosis and ADHD.

In this connection, the Court observes that an officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate was present at the hearing on 21 February 2005 and that, in accordance with section 31.2 of the Minors Act, a representative of the temporary detention centre was also required to be present.

Thus, even if the applicant’s personal file from the temporary detention centre has been destroyed, the Court considers that there is sufficient evidence to show that the authorities were aware of the applicant’s medical condition upon his admission to the temporary detention centre and that he was in need of treatment. Moreover, the fact that he was hospitalised the day after his release, and kept in the psychiatric hospital for almost three weeks, provides an indication that he was not given the necessary treatment for his condition at the temporary detention centre. The applicant has thereby provided the Court with a prima facie case of lack of adequate medical treatment. Having regard to the considerations set out above (see paragraphs 142-43 above) concerning the documents submitted by the Government and the lack of any other convincing evidence, the Court finds that the Government have failed to show that the applicant received the medical care required by his condition during his stay at the temporary detention centre where he was kept for thirty days without the right to leave and entirely under the control and responsibility of the staff at the centre. In these circumstances, the authorities were under an obligation to safeguard the applicant’s dignity and well-being, and are responsible under the Convention for the treatment he experienced (see M.S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 44)."

Thus, in the Court’s view, the applicant has not submitted sufficient prima facie evidence to show whether and, if so, to what extent he suffered from enuresis on admission to the temporary detention centre and whether the personnel at the centre were, or should have been, aware of it.

Italy, 1 July 1997, § 25, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV ). Moreover, in the context of the detention of minors, the words “educational supervision” must not be equated rigidly with notions of classroom teaching: in the context of a young person in local-authority care, educational supervision must embrace many aspects of the exercise, by the local authority, of parental rights for the benefit and protection of the person concerned (see P. and S. v.

Thus, for instance, a minor may be placed there while his identity and place of residence are established or for the time necessary to prepare his transfer to, or return following an escape from, a closed educational institution (section 22(2)(4-6) of the Minors Act). However, none of these grounds is relevant in the present case since the applicant’s placement was for the purpose of “correcting his behaviour”.

Bulgaria, no. 51776/08, §§ 66-74, 29 November 2011).

In this connection, the Court considers that, in order to avoid gaps in their education, schooling in line with the normal school curriculum should be standard practice for all minors deprived of their liberty and placed under the State’s responsibility, even when they are placed in a temporary detention centre for a limited period of time,. This is also supported by international instruments dealing with the deprivation of liberty of minors (see, for instance, Rules 77, 78.3 and 78.5 of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions and measures; Guidelines 21 and 28 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice; Rule 26.2 of the Beijing Rules; and Rule 38 of the Havana Rules. All of these sources are cited above in paragraphs 79, 80, 86 and 87 respectively). Consequently, while the Court accepts that some schooling was provided in the centre, it considers that this does not substantiate the Government’s argument that the applicant’s placement was “for the purpose” of educational supervision.

In their view, these sources confirmed that the purpose of the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre had been to prevent him from committing further offences, by correcting his behaviour, and not to punish him for the latest offence he had committed. Thus, the domestic courts had examined not only the circumstances of the latest offence, but the entire record of the applicant’s anti-social and delinquent behaviour, as well as his living conditions and family situation, and had concluded that he lacked the necessary supervision and that the preventive measures previously put in place had been inadequate. Consequently, the domestic court could not, and had not, established the applicant’s guilt in respect of a crime but had merely assessed the sufficiency of the evidence confirming his commission of an act prohibited by the Criminal Code. This could not amount to a “determination of a criminal charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1.

The Court’s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a ‘criminal charge’ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003 ‑ X).",
                "140. Turning to the present case, the Court observes that, after establishing that the applicant’s actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, the domestic authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings against him because he was under the statutory age of criminal responsibility ... Subsequently, in separate proceedings, a court ordered the applicant’s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days on the ground that he had committed a delinquent act – extortion – and it was necessary to ‘correct his behaviour’ and prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ...",
                "141. The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the proceedings against the applicant were not classified as criminal under domestic law. It has already recognised that States, in the performance of their task as guardians of the public interest, are entitled to create or maintain a distinction between different categories of offences for the purposes of their domestic law and to draw a dividing line between what belongs to the criminal sphere and what does not. By removing certain forms of conduct from the category of criminal offences under domestic law, the law-maker may be able to serve the needs of the proper administration of justice, as well as the interests of the individual, as in the present case for example, by exempting minors under a certain age from criminal liability for their actions according to the level of development of their mental and intellectual capacities. Nevertheless, the legal characterisation of the procedure under national law cannot be the sole criterion of relevance for the applicability of Article 6. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 49, Series A no. 73; Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, § 68, Series A no. 80; Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 83; and Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 45, 30 May 2006). In view of the above, the fact that the proceedings against the applicant were not classified as criminal under Russian law has only a formal and relative value; the ‘very nature of the offence is a factor of greater import’ (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 91).",
                "142. It was not disputed before the Court that the delinquent act imputed to the applicant corresponded to an offence in the ordinary criminal law. Indeed, the decision not to institute criminal proceedings stated that ‘[the applicant’s] actions ... contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, punishable by Article 163 of the Criminal Code’ ... At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the criminal charges against the applicant were not pursued on the ground that he had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility. It is, however, not necessary to decide whether, despite the indisputably criminal nature of the imputed offence, the fact that criminal prosecution of the applicant was legally impossible because of his age removed the proceedings against him from the ambit of the criminal limb of Article 6. The Court will instead concentrate on the third criterion: the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring.",
                "143. The Court observes that under Russian law a minor who has committed a delinquent act before reaching the statutory age of criminal responsibility may be placed in a closed educational institution for up to three years, or in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for up to thirty days ... In the present case, within a month of the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant, the local department of the interior asked a court to place him in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on the ground that he had committed a delinquent act for which he could not be held criminally liable because of his age. Referring to his unruly way of life and previous delinquent acts, the local department of the interior claimed that it was necessary to detain the applicant in order to ‘correct’ his behaviour and prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ... The District Court ordered the applicant’s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days for ‘behaviour correction’, on the grounds that he had not ‘drawn proper conclusions’ from his previous placements in that centre and had committed a further delinquent act ... The Regional Court upheld that decision on appeal, referring to the fact that the applicant had committed a delinquent act punishable by the Criminal Code and to his family situation and poor school performance. It found that his placement in the centre was necessary to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ...",
                "144. The Court is not oblivious to the fact that the decision to place the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders was taken in separate proceedings which were formally unrelated to the criminal pre-investigation inquiry regarding the applicant. However, taking into account that the domestic courts referred to the fact that the applicant had committed a delinquent act as the main reason for his placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, and that in their decisions they extensively relied on the documents obtained and the findings made during the criminal pre-investigation inquiry, the Court considers that there was a close link, both in law and fact, between the criminal pre-investigation inquiry and the placement proceedings. Indeed, the wording of the applicable legal provisions and of the judicial decisions, both cited in paragraph 143 above, clearly shows that the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders was a direct consequence of the local department of the interior’s finding that his actions had contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion.",
                "145. The Court has already found that the placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders amounted to a deprivation of the applicant’s liberty ... There is therefore a presumption that the proceedings against the applicant were ‘criminal’ within the meaning of Article 6, a presumption which was rebuttable only in entirely exceptional circumstances and only if the deprivation of liberty could not be considered “appreciably detrimental” given its nature, duration or manner of execution (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 126).",
                "146. As already found above, the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders did not pursue the purpose of educational supervision ... The stated purpose of the applicant’s placement in the detention centre for juvenile offenders was to correct his behaviour and to deter him from committing further delinquent acts rather than to punish him. However, the Court’s case-law indicates that it may be necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV, and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 123).",
                "147. The Court notes that the applicant’s detention lasted thirty days and was served in a detention centre for juvenile offenders rather than in an educational institution. As established above, the centre was closed and guarded to prevent inmates from leaving without authorisation. Inmates were subject to constant supervision and to a strict disciplinary regime ... The Court therefore considers that the deprivation of liberty, imposed after a finding that the applicant’s actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion and served in a detention centre for juvenile offenders subject to a quasi-penitentiary regime as described above, contained punitive elements as well as elements of prevention and deterrence. The Court finds it difficult to distinguish between the punishment and deterrent aims of the measure in question, these objectives not being mutually exclusive and being recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties. Indeed, in the Court’s case-law criminal penalties have customarily been recognised as comprising the twin objectives of punishment and deterrence (see Öztürk, cited above, § 53; Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, § 47, Series A no. 284; Lauko v. Slovakia, 2 September 1998, § 58, Reports 1998 ‑ VI; and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, §§ 102 and 105).",
                "148. In view of the nature, duration and manner of execution of the deprivation of liberty which was liable to be, and which actually was, imposed on the applicant, the Court finds no exceptional circumstances capable of rebutting the presumption that the proceedings against the applicant were “criminal” within the meaning of Article 6.",
                "149. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the nature of the offence, together with the nature and severity of the penalty, were such that the proceedings against the applicant constituted criminal proceedings within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. This Article therefore applies to the proceedings against the applicant.”"

When doing so in the applicant’s case, the Court considers that his placement for thirty days in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders had clear elements of both deterrence and punishment (see paragraph 147 of the Chamber judgment)."

In its view, since the proceedings taken against the applicant concerned the determination of a criminal charge, the applicant’s complaints should be seen in the context of the more far-reaching procedural guarantees enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention rather than Article 5 § 4. The Court would add that it does not agree with the Government’s submission that the applicant’s situation should be treated in the same way as that of a mentally ill defendant. In cases of mentally ill defendants, the proceedings can lead to their being placed in closed institutions for treatment and to prevent them from committing further criminal acts.

Moreover, having regard to his young age, it considered the circumstances surrounding the questioning to have been psychologically coercive. The Chamber further observed that the applicant’s confession to the police had been used against him in the ensuing proceedings. Thus, the absence of a lawyer while in police custody had irremediably affected his defence rights and undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole. There had therefore been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c)."

Reasonable accommodation meant that appropriate modification and adjustments, which did not impose a disproportionate or undue burden, should be taken in each particular case.

Moreover, the LIGA pointed out that Council of Europe Recommendation CM/Rec(2008)11 on the European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures (see paragraph 79 above) provided that juveniles should not have fewer legal rights and safeguards than those provided to adult offenders by the general rules of criminal procedure. The LIGA also stressed that the right to legal assistance, referred to in various international instruments, applied from the very outset of a procedure, including the police questioning stage, involving children and those under the age of criminal responsibility. Since children below the age of criminal responsibility were often subject to very paternalistic proceedings on the grounds that the proceedings were not penal but protective, the traditional procedural safeguards were often not applied. That approach was based on the theory of welfare juvenile justice systems which had emerged in the United States of America and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and had been systematically criticised by a number of scholars for its overall paternalistic approach to children, typically suppressing their procedural rights and treating them as objects of care and discipline."

It is essential that a child charged with an offence is dealt with in a manner which takes full account of his age, level of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities, and that steps are taken to promote his ability to understand and participate in the proceedings (see Adamkiewicz v. Poland, no. 54729/00, § 70, 2 March 2010; Panovits v.

The right of a juvenile defendant to effective participation in his criminal trial requires that the authorities deal with him with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, during any questioning by the police. The authorities must take steps to reduce, as far as possible, the child’s feelings of intimidation and inhibition and ensure that he has a broad understanding of the nature of the investigation, of what is at stake for him, including the significance of any penalty which may be imposed as well as of his rights of defence and, in particular, of his right to remain silent ( see Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § 92, 30 May 2013; Panovits, cited above, § 67; and S.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 60958/00, § 29, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV )."

On no account may a child be deprived of important procedural safeguards solely because the proceedings that may result in his deprivation of liberty are deemed under domestic law to be protective of his interests as a child and juvenile delinquent, rather than penal. Furthermore, particular care must be taken to ensure that the legal classification of a child as a juvenile delinquent does not lead to the focus being shifted to his status as such, while neglecting to examine the specific criminal act of which he has been accused and the need to adduce proof of his guilt in conditions of fairness. Processing a child offender through the criminal-justice system on the sole basis of his status of being a juvenile delinquent, which lacks legal definition, cannot be considered compatible with due process and the principle of legality (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, §§ 45-47, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, relating to the legal classification of recidivism).

As regards legal assistance at the pre-trial stages of the proceedings, the Court has emphasised the importance of the investigative stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at trial. Therefore, the Court has held that the particular vulnerability of the accused at the initial stages of police questioning can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. Indeed, this right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. It is further important to protect the accused against coercion on the part of the authorities and contribute to the prevention of miscarriage of justice and ensure equality of arms. Accordingly, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as soon as a suspect is questioned by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced where incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used to secure a conviction (see Panovits, cited above, §§ 64-66, and Salduz v.

He also had to wait a certain amount of time before being questioned by a police officer. However, there is no indication that the applicant was in any form or manner informed that he had the right to call his grandfather, a teacher, a lawyer or another person of confidence during this period for them to come and assist him during the questioning. Nor were any steps taken to ensure that legal assistance was provided to him during the questioning. The Government’s submission that the applicant’s grandfather was present during the questioning remains unsupported by evidence. Moreover, the Court notes that the confession statement signed by the applicant – the probative value of which must be considered to be extremely questionable given his young age and health condition – did not mention the grandfather’s presence and was not countersigned by him. The written statement signed by his grandfather on the same day could, as claimed by the applicant, have been signed later, after the applicant had been questioned by the police officer, and thus does not prove his presence during the questioning. In this connection, the Court notes that it was marked on the applicant’s confession statement that he had been informed of his right not to make self-incriminating statements. However, that document did not mention that the applicant had been informed of his right to have legal counsel or someone else present during the questioning or that any such person had indeed been present."

This passive approach adopted by the police was clearly not sufficient to fulfil their positive obligation to furnish the applicant, a child, suffering, moreover, from ADHD, with the necessary information enabling him to obtain legal representation (see Panovits, cited above, § 72)."

The Court has previously found that a systematic restriction on the right of access to legal assistance, on the basis of statutory provisions, is sufficient in itself to constitute a violation of Article 6 (see Salduz, cited above, § 56). Moreover, it is contrary to the basic principles set out in international sources according to which a minor should be guaranteed legal, or other appropriate, assistance (see, for example, Article 40 § 2 (b) (ii) of the CRC, and the comments thereto; Rule 7.1 of the Beijing Rules; and Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (87) 20, point 8, all cited in paragraphs 82, 83-84, 86 and 77 above)."

In fact, he retracted the confession immediately when his grandfather came to the police station, and protested his innocence. In this regard, the Court emphasises that the confession statement, made in the absence of a lawyer, was not only used against the applicant in the proceedings to place him in the temporary detention centre but actually formed the basis, in combination with the witness statements of S. and his mother, for the domestic courts’ finding that his actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, thus providing the ground for his placement in the centre."

At the hearing, the applicant, his grandfather and court-appointed counsel were present, as were a prosecutor and the officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate who had ruled on 12 January 2005 not to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant. From the judgment, it appears that the applicant and his grandfather had the opportunity to address the court and submit documents.

The Court reiterates that the applicant had retracted the confession and had claimed that it had been obtained under duress. Moreover, as found above, the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the questioning at the police station, which irremediably affected his defence rights. Furthermore, the grandfather also claimed that the applicant had been at a doctor’s surgery earlier on the relevant day. However, the Court observes that neither S. nor his mother was called to the hearing to give evidence and provide the applicant with an opportunity to cross-examine them, despite the fact that their testimonies were of decisive importance to the pre-investigation inquiry’s conclusion that the applicant had committed a delinquent act, namely, extortion."

There was, consequently, no good reason for the witnesses’ non-attendance. Moreover, in view of the fact that the applicant had retracted his confession, the Court considers that it was important for the fairness of the proceedings that S. and his mother be heard.

In fact, no efforts were made by the authorities to secure the appearance of S. and his mother in court, even though the Minors Act does provide for the possibility of hearing witnesses, as acknowledged by the Government. Having regard to the fact that what was at stake for the applicant in the placement proceedings was his deprivation of liberty for thirty days – not a negligible length of time for a 12-year-old boy – the Court considers that it was of utmost importance that the District Court guarantee the fairness of the proceedings."

Lastly, the Court notes that there were no counterbalancing factors to compensate for the applicant’s inability to cross-examine S. and his mother at any stage of the proceedings. As noted by the Chamber in paragraph 173 of its judgment, the applicant was not provided with an opportunity to scrutinise the witnesses’ questioning by the investigator, nor was he then or later provided with the opportunity to have his own questions put to them. Furthermore, as the witnesses’ statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe the witnesses’ demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, for similar reasoning, Makeyev v.

Instead, the Minors Act was applicable to the applicant. This Act provided for significantly restricted procedural safeguards (see paragraph 68 above) since it was intended as protective legislation for minors. According to the Court, and as also noted by the LIGA in its submission (see paragraph 192 above), this is where, as illustrated by the present case, the legislature’s intention to protect children and ensure their care and treatment comes into conflict with reality and the principles set out in paragraph 196 above, since the child is deprived of his liberty without having the procedural rights to defend himself properly against the imposition of such a harsh measure."

In the Court’s view, minors, whose cognitive and emotional development in any event requires special consideration, and in particular young children under the age of criminal responsibility, deserve support and assistance to protect their rights when coercive measures, albeit in the guise of educational measures, are applied in their regard. As is clear from the relevant international materials before the Court (see paragraphs 77-89 above), this has been established in many international documents. It has also been emphasised by the third-party interveners. Thus, the Court is convinced that adequate procedural safeguards must be in place to protect the best interests and well-being of the child, certainly when his or her liberty is at stake. To find otherwise would be to put children at a clear disadvantage compared with adults in the same situation. In this connection, children with disabilities may require additional safeguards to ensure that they are sufficiently protected. The Court would point out that this does not mean, however, that children should be exposed to a fully fledged criminal trial; their rights should be secured in an adapted and age-appropriate setting in line with international standards, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child."

For the same reason, it is not for the Court to determine when that review should take place.

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought.

However, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty ‑ five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control."

It is also true that, in exercising that power – as with all statutory powers – the Secretary of State is legally bound to act compatibly with the Convention (see section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, set out at paragraph 33 above). As the Government suggested in their pleadings before the Court, it would therefore be possible to read section 30 as not just giving a power of release to the Secretary of State, but as imposing a duty on him to exercise that power and to release a prisoner if it can be shown that his or her continued detention has become incompatible with Article 3, for example, when it can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds.",

Notwithstanding the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, namely if a prisoner is terminally ill or physically incapacitated and other additional criteria can be met (namely that the risk of re-offending is minimal, further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner ’ s life expectancy, there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner ’ s care and treatment outside prison, and early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his or her family)."

Indeed, in the Court ’ s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a “ prospect of release ” in Kafkaris, cited above.

In particular, the Order does not reflect the possibility – made available by the Human Rights Act – for even whole life prisoners to seek release on legitimate penological grounds some time into the service of their sentence. To that extent, on the basis of the Government ’ s own submissions as to the state of the applicable domestic law, the Prison Service Order is liable to give to whole life prisoners – those directly affected by it – only a partial picture of the exceptional conditions capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State ’ s power under section 30."

At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts.

The finding of a violation in their cases cannot therefore be understood as giving them the prospect of imminent release.",

                "12. Since the abolition of the death penalty in England and Wales, the sentence for murder has been a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Currently, when such a sentence is imposed, the trial judge is required to set a minimum term of imprisonment, which must be served for the purposes of punishment and retribution, taking into account the seriousness of the offence. The principles which guide the trial judge ’ s assessment of the appropriate minimum term are set out in schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (see paragraphs 38 – 39 below). Once the minimum term has been served, the prisoner may apply to the Parole Board for release on licence.",
                "Exceptionally, however, “a whole life order” may be imposed by the trial judge instead of a minimum term if, applying the principles set out in schedule 21, he or she considers that the seriousness of the offence is exceptionally high.",
                "The effect of a whole life order is that the prisoner cannot be released other than at the discretion of the Secretary of State. The power of the Secretary of State to release a prisoner is provided for in section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. The Secretary of State will only exercise his discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated (see Prison Service Order 4700 set out at paragraph 43 below)."

Prior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, it was the practice for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the trial judge and for the Secretary of State, after receiving recommendations from the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, to decide the minimum term of imprisonment which the prisoner would have to serve before he would be eligible for early release on licence. At the time, the minimum term was also referred to as the “tariff” part of the sentence.",
                "It was also open to the Secretary of State to impose a “ whole life tariff ” on a prisoner. In such a case, it was the practice of the Secretary of State to review a whole life tariff after twenty-five years ’ imprisonment to determine whether it was still justified, particularly with reference to cases where the prisoner had made exceptional progress in prison (see the case of Hindley at paragraph 46 below).",

All three applicants have been given whole life orders: in the first applicant ’ s case this order was made by the trial judge under the current sentencing provisions; in the case of the second and third applicants, who were convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, the orders were made by the High Court. All three applicants maintain that these whole life orders, as they apply to their cases, are incompatible inter alia with Articles 3 and 5 § 4 of the Convention.

On 31 December 2006 the first applicant was involved in a fight in a public house and charged with affray (using or threatening unlawful violence). His licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison. In July 2007, having pleaded guilty to the charge of affray, he was sentenced to 6 months ’ imprisonment. He was released on licence again in December 2007 and returned to live with his wife and her four children. The couple became estranged and the first applicant left the marital home."

The couple argued and the wife ’ s daughter, who was present, telephoned the police to alert them to the dispute. The first applicant ordered his wife to get into a car. When the daughter tried to get into the car to protect her mother, the first applicant forcibly removed her. He then drove off with his wife. When the police telephoned her to ascertain if she was safe, the first applicant forced his wife to tell them that she was fine. The first applicant also telephoned the police to tell them that his wife was safe and well. Some hours later he gave himself up to the police, telling them that he had killed her. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had a broken nose, deep and extensive bruising to her neck (which was consistent with attempted strangulation), and four stab wounds to the chest. Two knives were found at the scene, one of which had a broken blade."

The trial judge considered that the first applicant fell into that small category of people who should be deprived permanently of their liberty. He passed the mandatory life sentence and made a whole life order."

It considered the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act: see paragraphs 38 and 39 below). It found that, given the circumstances of the offence, there was no reason whatever to depart from the normal principle enshrined in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act that, where murder was committed by someone who was already a convicted murderer, a whole life order was appropriate for punishment and deterrence."

The second applicant was subsequently charged and, on 28 October 1986, convicted of the murders. The prosecution ’ s case was that the murders were premeditated and planned and had been committed for financial gain. It was also alleged that the second applicant had arranged the crime scene so as to mislead the police by making it appear as if his adoptive sister had killed the family and then herself."

On the trial judge ’ s letter to the Secretary of State, the Lord Chief Justice added the comment “for my part I would never release him”. In 1988, the Secretary of State imposed a whole life tariff. The practice at the time was not to inform the prisoner of this decision. By letter dated 15 December 1994, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had concluded that the requirements of retribution and deterrence could only be satisfied by the second applicant remaining in prison for the whole of his life."

Having regard to schedule 21 to the Act, the High Court concluded that, given the number of murders involved and the presence of premeditation by the second applicant, the offence plainly fell within that category of cases where the appropriate starting point was a whole life order. Having further regard to statements submitted by the victims ’ next-of-kin and submissions by the second applicant, including reports as to the behaviour and progress he had made in prison, the High Court found that there was no reason to depart from the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the Secretary of State.

The court found that, when the Secretary of State had set a whole life tariff in 1988, he had been provided with two different judicial recommendations: one from the trial judge recommending a minimum term of twenty-five years and one from the Lord Chief Justice recommending that the second applicant should never be released. The Secretary of State had been entitled to choose between those recommendations or to adopt neither of them. The Court of Appeal also found that the whole life order imposed by the High Court was not only correct but, for the purposes of punishment and retribution, fully justified."

Cyprus ( [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... ). Finally, it found that the review procedure created by the 2003 Act was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention as, properly construed, the relevant statutory provisions meant a prisoner could not be disadvantaged by the outcome of the review: the term to be served could be reduced, or maintained, but it could not be increased or extended."

Each victim was stabbed many times with a large combat knife which the third applicant had bought for that purpose. The first victim was attacked in his home on 23 September 1995. Soon after, on the weekend of 7 October 1995, the third applicant met his second victim in a bar and arranged to take him home for sex; he instead took him to a forest, stabbed him to death and left the body there. The third victim was stabbed in the caravan where he lived on 30 November 1995.

It found that, while weight should be accorded to that recommendation, the Lord Chief Justice did not have regard to the principles set out in schedule 21 as the High Court was required to do. It also rejected the submission that an issue arose under Article 6 of the Convention, given that a whole life tariff had been set by the Secretary of State. The High Court found that the procedure for applying to the High Court under section 276 and schedule 22 of the Act provided the necessary independent review as to whether a prisoner should be released. The court also found that a whole life order was compatible with Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. Having regard to the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the Act), no issue of arbitrariness arose and whether such a sentence was disproportionate depended on the facts of each case."

There were no mitigating features and even the Lord Chief Justice, although recommending a minimum term of thirty years, had shared the trial judge ’ s view that it might never be safe to release the third applicant. There were no reasons, therefore, to mitigate the starting point of a whole life order.

It seems to us that the Court [in Kafkaris ] considered that an irreducible life sentence raises an issue under Article 3 in circumstances where it may result in an offender being detained beyond the term that is justified by the legitimate objects of imprisonment. This is implicit in the fact that no issue under Article 3 appears to arise provided that there is, in law and in practice, a possibility of the offender being released, even though it remains possible, or even likely, that no release will be granted in his lifetime. The essential requirement appears to be the possibility of a review that will determine whether imprisonment remains justified.",
                "40. The legitimate objects of imprisonment are punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation and protection of the public. Where a mandatory life sentence is imposed in respect of a crime, the possibility exists that all the objects of imprisonment may be achieved during the lifetime of the prisoner. He may have served a sufficient term to meet the requirements of punishment and deterrence and rehabilitation may have transformed him into a person who no longer poses any threat to a public. If, despite this, he will remain imprisoned for the rest of his life it is at least arguable that this is inhuman treatment. Thus we have concluded that, where a crime attracts a mandatory and irreducible life sentence regardless of the particular circumstances of the crime, an issue will arise in relation to Article 3.",
                "41. The decision in Kafkaris raises a more difficult issue. Is there some maximum term of imprisonment that can be justified by the objects of punishment and deterrence, after which a prisoner ought to be released if rehabilitation has transformed him into a man who no longer poses a threat of criminal behaviour? If this question falls to be answered in the affirmative, then an irreducible life sentence that may result in detention beyond that term is arguably inhuman and raises an issue under Article 3. The concurring opinion of Judge Bratza and the opinion of the five dissentients suggest that they were of the view that this was indeed the position. The European material to which we have referred suggests that some Member States consider that there is a maximum sentence of imprisonment that can be justified by way of punishment, after which humanity requires that the offender be given the opportunity to demonstrate that he is fit to be permitted back into society.",

The Court was in that case dealing with a mandatory life sentence and the approach of the Court must be considered in that context.

The judge specifies the minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the offender ’ s release on licence can be considered. Where a whole life term is specified this is because the judge considers that the offence is so serious that, for purposes of punishment and deterrence, the offender must remain in prison for the rest of his days. For the reasons that we have given, we do not consider that the Strasbourg court has ruled that an irreducible life sentence, deliberately imposed by a judge in such circumstances, will result in detention that violates Article 3. Nor do we consider that it will do so.",

The destruction of a life may be accepted in some special circumstances, such as self-defence or just war; but retributive punishment is never enough to justify it. Yet a prisoner ’ s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death. He can never atone for his offence. However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life, his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath. Like the death sentence the whole-life tariff is lex talionis. But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner (the only virtue of the lex talionis ) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment, for the whole-life tariff is arbitrary: it may be measured in days or decades according to how long the prisoner has to live. It is therefore liable to be disproportionate – the very vice which is condemned on Article 3 grounds – unless, of course, the death penalty ’ s logic applies: the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for. But in that case the supposed inalienable value of the prisoner ’ s life is reduced, merely, to his survival: to nothing more than his drawing breath and being kept, no doubt, confined in decent circumstances. That is to pay lip ‑ service to the value of life; not to vouchsafe it.”",

Respect for human dignity and the rule of law meant the humane enforcement of life imprisonment was possible only when the prisoner was given “a concrete and realistically attainable chance” to regain his freedom at some later point in time; the State struck at the very heart of human dignity if it stripped the prisoner of all hope of ever earning his freedom.",

However, a judicial balancing of these factors should not place too heavy an emphasis on the gravity of the crime as opposed to the personality, state of mind, and age of the person. In that case, any subsequent review of the petitioner ’ s request for release would be required to weigh more heavily than before the petitioner ’ s personality, age and prison record. This was because the negative effects of sentence became stronger and stronger after an unusually long period of imprisonment.",

The German government had sought assurances that he would be considered for release and had received the reply that the President of Turkey had the power to remit sentences on grounds of chronic illness, disability, or old age.

The Constitutional Court found that, on the basis of Article 27(3) of the Constitution, rehabilitation was the aim of every sentence and the right of every prisoner. As such, there should be review of the sentence, carried out by a judge rather than a member of the executive, to determine whether, given the time served, rehabilitation had been achieved. The court also emphasised that, subject to appropriate conditions, parole was essential to achieving the aim of rehabilitation. The same conclusion was reached in respect of those serving life sentences in military prisons by the court in judgment 192/1976, 14 July 1976, concerning two German military officers serving such sentences for crimes committed during World War II.",

Referring to its earlier judgment of 27 June 1974, the court found that there was the possibility of parole ( even for life prisoners ) and decisions on parole had to be taken by the judiciary rather than the executive. These factors meant rehabilitation of a life prisoner was possible and, as such, the practice of life sentences was compatible with Article 27(3).",

In declaring the provision unconstitutional, the court recalled that Article 27(3) applied to all sentences without distinction and that the provision allowing for reduction of sentences (which had the stated aim of encouraging rehabilitation) could not in principle be precluded from applying to life sentences. The effect of the judgment was that, in respect of life sentences, the provisions on reduction of sentences applied to the period to be served before a life prisoner became eligible for parole.",

Recalling its previous judgments on rehabilitation and the importance of parole to rehabilitation, the Constitutional Court found that the effect of Article 177 was to exclude entirely the possibility of the prisoner ’ s rehabilitation. The court went on to find that the possibility of parole was the only means by which a sentence of life imprisonment could remain compatible with Article 27(3); if there was no such possibility the sentence would be incompatible with Article 27(3). As it stood, Article 177 was therefore unconstitutional. It remained for the legislature to determine the conditions under which parole could be obtained, provided that those conditions complied with the Constitution.",

Such circumstances might include sociological and psychological re-evaluation of the character of the offender which might destroy the previous fear that his or her release after a few years might endanger the safety of others or evidence which might otherwise show that the offender has reached such an advanced age or become so infirm and sick or so repentant about his or her past, that continuous incarceration of the offender at state expense constitutes a cruelty which can no longer be defended in the public interest. ”",

The Mauritian Supreme Court had interpreted such a sentence as condemning de Boucherville to penal servitude for the rest of his life, a sentence to which the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not apply. In the view of the Privy Council, this meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and arbitrary and so contrary to section 10 of the Mauritian Constitution (provisions to secure protection of law, including the right to a fair trial).",

The Privy Council also considered any differences between mandatory sentences of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and, to this end, quoted with approval the dicta of Lord Bingham in Lichniak and Lord Justice Laws in Wellington (at paragraphs and 45 and 54 above).",

Second, the Chamber noted that, under the previous statutory system in England and Wales a review of the need for a whole life order took place after the prisoner had served twenty five years of his or her sentence. No explanation had been provided for the failure to include that review mechanism in the current legislation, the 2003 Act. It was also of some relevance that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provided for an identical review period for life sentences imposed by that court.

Although the second and third applicants had served respectively twenty-six and sixteen years in prison, they were effectively re-sentenced in 200 8 when they applied to the High Court for review of their whole life orders.

There was a lack of consensus amongst the Contracting States in respect of life sentences, as shown, for instance, by the non-mandatory language of Article 5(2) of the Framework Decision of the Council on the European arrest warrant (see paragraph 67 above). The penal policy of England and Wales was long-standing and well-established.

Indeed, in the Government ’ s submission, it might never arise. For this reason, the Convention did not require a review mechanism for life sentences. A review mechanism would be directed at offering only a tenuous hope of release. The tenuous nature of that hope arose from the fact that a whole life order was imposed to punish the offender for the exceptional gravity of his or her crime, and the gravity of that crime remained constant over time. Article 3 did not require a procedure offering such a tenuous hope. Instead, it required that a prisoner ’ s Convention rights be vindicated if time ever came when continued detention was incompatible with Article 3.

This is because States have a duty under the Convention to take measures for the protection of the public from violent crime and the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender ’ s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public (see, mutatis mutandis, T. v. the United Kingdom, § 97, and V. v. the United Kingdom, § 98, both cited above ). Indeed, preventing a criminal from re-offending is one of the “essential functions” of a prison sentence ( see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 72, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Maiorano and Others v.

This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person. The mere fact that such prisoners may have already served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State ’ s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others, cited above)."

Many of these grounds will be present at the time when a life sentence is imposed. However, the balance between these justifications for detention is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of the sentence. What may be the primary justification for detention at the start of the sentence may not be so after a lengthy period into the service of the sentence.

If anything, the punishment becomes greater with time : the longer the prisoner lives, the longer his sentence. Thus, even when a whole life sentence is condign punishment at the time of its imposition, with the passage of time it becomes – to paraphrase Lord Justice Laws in Wellington – a poor guarantee of just and proportionate punishment (see paragraph 54 above)."

It was that conclusion which led the Constitutional Court to find that the prison authorities had the duty to strive towards a life sentenced prisoner ’ s rehabilitation and that rehabilitation was constitutionally required in any community that established human dignity as its centrepiece. Indeed, the Constitutional Court went on to make clear in the subsequent War Criminal case that this applied to all life prisoners, whatever the nature of their crimes, and that release only for those who were infirm or close to death was not sufficient (see paragraph 70 above).",

These show that a large majority of Contracting States either do not impose life sentences at all or, if they do impose life sentences, provide some dedicated mechanism, integrated within the sentencing legislation, guaranteeing a review of those life sentences after a set period, usually after twenty-five years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 68 above)."

For the same reason, it is not for the Court to determine when that review should take place.

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration."

The Court would begin by observing that, as the Chamber found in its judgment (at paragraph 94), it is not persuaded by the reasons adduced by the Government for the decision not to include a twenty-five year review in the current legislation on life sentences in England and Wales, the 2003 Act (see paragraph 95 above). It recalls that such a review, albeit vested in the executive, existed in the previous statutory system (see paragraph 46 above).",

However, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty ‑ five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control."

            [
                "125. Moreover, there is a lack of clarity as to the current law concerning the prospect of release of life prisoners. It is true that section 30 of the 1997 Act provides the Secretary of State with the power to release any prisoner, including one serving a whole life order (see paragraph 42 above). It is also true that, in exercising that power – as with all statutory powers – the Secretary of State is legally bound to act compatibly with the Convention (see section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, set out at paragraph 33 above). As the Government suggested in their pleadings before the Court, it would therefore be possible to read section 30 as not just giving a power of release to the Secretary of State, but as imposing a duty on him to exercise that power and to release a prisoner if it can be shown that his or her continued detention has become incompatible with Article 3, for example, when it can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds.",
                "This was, in effect, the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal in Bieber and re-affirmed by it in Oakes (see, in particular, paragraph 49 above, setting out paragraphs 48 and 49 of Bieber and the Court of Appeal ’ s observation that while the section 30 power had been used sparingly, there was no reason why it should not be used by the Secretary of State to effect the necessary compliance with Article 3 of the Convention).",
                "This reading of section 30 ensuring some prospects under the law for release of whole life prisoners would, in principle, be consistent with this Court ’ s judgment in Kafkaris, cited above. If it could be established that, in the applicants ’ cases, a sufficient degree of certainty existed as to the state of the applicable domestic law to this effect, it could not be said that their sentences were irreducible and thus no violation of Article 3 would be disclosed."

However, the Court must be concerned with the law as it presently stands on the published policies as well as in judicial dicta and as it is applied in practice to whole life prisoners. The fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his section 30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, namely if a prisoner is terminally ill or physically incapacitated and other additional criteria can be met (namely that the risk of re-offending is minimal, further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner ’ s life expectancy, there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner ’ s care and treatment outside prison, and early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his or her family)."

Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court ’ s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a “ prospect of release ” in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3."

In particular, the Order does not reflect the possibility – made available by the Human Rights Act – for even whole life prisoners to seek release on legitimate penological grounds some time into the service of their sentence. To that extent, on the basis of the Government ’ s own submissions as to the state of the applicable domestic law, the Prison Service Order is liable to give to whole life prisoners – those directly affected by it – only a partial picture of the exceptional conditions capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State ’ s power under section 30."

At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts.

In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, §§ 247- 68 ), the Court considered whether Mr Harakchiev ’ s sentence of life imprisonment without commutation could be regarded as giving rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court found that from the time when that sentence had become final – November 2004 – until the beginning of 2012, it could not be regarded as reducible, as required under the Court ’ s case-law under Article 3 in relation to life sentences, for two reasons. First, it was unclear whether before a 2006 amendment to the Criminal Code 1968 that had expressly provided that the presidential power of clemency extended to that type of sentence, the sentence had been de jure reducible. Secondly, the manner in which the presidential power of clemency had been exercised before the early months of 2012 had been quite opaque, and there had existed no concrete examples showing that persons serving sentences of life imprisonment without commutation could hope to benefit from the exercise of that power and obtain an adjustment of their sentence. Mr Harakchiev ’ s sentence could not therefore be regarded as de facto reducible before that time. The Court went on to say that although there was no right to rehabilitation under the Convention, its Article 3 required the Contracting States to give life prisoners a chance, however remote, to someday regain their freedom. For that chance to be genuine, those prisoners had to be given a proper opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. In that context, while Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation to decide on such things as the regime and conditions of a life prisoner ’ s incarceration, those points could not be considered as a matter of indifference. Mr Harakchiev had been subjected to a particularly stringent prison regime, which had entailed almost complete isolation and very limited possibilities for social contacts, work or education, and had been kept in unsatisfactory material conditions. He could not therefore be regarded as being able to entertain a real hope that he might one day achieve and demonstrate progress towards rehabilitation and on that basis seek an adjustment of his sentence.

The vast majority of those complaints concerned the food served in prison: concrete instances in which the applicant had allegedly not received a full portion, yoghurt had been missing, the food had had a bad taste or smell, or meat had not been provided or had been of low quality. Some of those complaints had been acknowledged as well-founded by the prison administration and the applicant had been assured that measures would be taken."

They said that the quality and quantity of food served to inmates had been fully adequate, and that hygienic conditions in the prison canteen, including in relation to cutlery, had been maintained in line with the applicable standards. Water in the prison had not been muddy; it came from the same pipeline as the water supplied to the town of Bobov Dol. Inmates could also buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen. The allegation that iron pieces had protruded from the applicant ’ s bed was not true, and his bed sheets had been changed and washed every week. Bathing time had not been counted as part of the outdoor walk time; unlike other inmates, who had only had one hour of daily outdoor walk time, life prisoners had been allowed one and a half hours. The only reasons for interrupting that walk had been rowdy conduct or bad weather; in the latter case, more outdoor time had been made available later on. The yard designated for the daily outdoor walk did not have a toilet for security and hygiene reasons. Such a toilet was in any event not needed because that yard was adjacent to the applicant ’ s cell, which was equipped with a toilet. If the applicant had felt an urgent need to go to the toilet during his daily walk, he could have always used that one, and would have never been prevented from doing so. The prison administration was not under a duty to provide inmates with waterproof clothing; when such clothing had been provided as a matter of courtesy, the inmates had very quickly damaged it. It was not true that guard dogs had been kept near the applicant ’ s cell; such dogs had not been used at all in the zone at issue. Nor had there been rats inside the applicant ’ s cell; its door, windows and piping had been built in a way not permitting rats to come in, and the prison administration was under a duty regularly to carry out pest control. The applicant ’ s cell had had central heating since 2007, and the temperature inside the cell and the bathroom had been around eighteen degrees Celsius. The cell ’ s window, which, like all windows in Bobov Dol Prison, had had its old wooden frame replaced with a new PVC one, did not have any covers preventing sunlight from coming in and could be freely opened, and the cell ’ s floor was covered with linoleum which was in a good condition.

The court noted that although there was evidence that sometimes, especially after heavy rains, the quality of that water had been bad, the laboratory analysis had confirmed that it had been safe for drinking. The prison was connected to the general water supply system and got the same water as that supplied to households nearby. The applicant ’ s allegations, for instance that he had endured acute stomach pain and had required medical assistance, had not been made out. Moreover, the applicant had had the possibility to buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen or, if he did not have the necessary means for that, boil tap water using a device which he confirmed that he had in his cell, or filter it.

Another case decided on the merits by the Kyustendil Administrative Court on 17 March 2011 concerned thirty-three separate allegations relating to various aspects of the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention. It appears that in his statement of claim the applicant had made confused assertions about the periods of time to which those claims related and that he eventually only claimed non-pecuniary damages in respect of a limited period of time in the first half of 2010. The court dismissed all of the applicant ’ s claims. With regard, in particular, to the surface of the area for daily outdoor walks, it found that it was one hundred square metres. It went on to note that the bodily searches to which the applicant had been subjected had not involved any undressing or inappropriate touching of his private parts but patting, through his clothes, with a view to determining whether or not he had had on him any unauthorised items. The systematic handcuffing of the applicant was not in breach of the Execution of Punishments and Pre ‑ Trial Detention Act 2009 or the regulations for its application, was not inconsistent with the applicant ’ s prison regime, could be considered necessary in view of the seriousness of the offences in relation to which he had been sentenced to life imprisonment, and had not been intended to humiliate the applicant. With regard to the claim that the applicant had not been transferred to a multi-occupancy cell despite the possibility to do so for life prisoners serving their life sentence under the “severe” regime, the court found that those matters fell within the discretion of the special commission for the execution of sentences; there had therefore not been a failure on the part of the prison authorities to observe a binding legal obligation. The same went for educational courses. The applicant ’ s appeal on points of law against that judgment was not examined by the Supreme Administrative Court as he failed to pay the requisite fee of 5 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (the equivalent of 2. 5 6 euros (EUR)) for the processing of the appeal (see опр. № 9090 от 23 юни 2011 г. по адм. д. № 8057/2011 г., ВАС, ІІІ о. )."

It is clear, and indeed confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s case-law, that a claim under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 does not lie in respect of that (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 145)."

As to whether such a claim could be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the regime and conditions of the applicant ’ s detention, the Court notes that the applicant brought a considerable number of claims for damages in relation to the regime and conditions of his detention. While the Kyustendil Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings pursuant to a number of those claims for various reasons, it did examine some of the claims on the merits (see paragraphs 25 - 28 above). However, under the Court ’ s well-established case-law claims for damages can only be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in respect of allegedly poor conditions of detention if the applicant has been released or placed in Article 3-compliant conditions (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, §§ 222-25, with further references ). The applicant is still incarcerated, and it does not appear that, except with respect to heating, cell windows and size of the outdoor walk area, the conditions of his detention – in particular, his very restrictive prison regime – have significantly changed in recent years (see paragraphs 8 - 10 and 30 above). A claim for damages under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 or another legal provision is therefore, on its own, not capable of providing the applicant adequate relief. Moreover, such a claim, in so far as directed against conditions of incarceration that flow directly from the prison regime applicable to the applicant, would not have stood any prospect of success, given that the Bulgarian courts have already dismissed such claims on the basis that such conditions were not unlawful (ibid., § 226).

The Court found that from the time when that sentence had become final – November 2004 – until the beginning of 2012, it could not be regarded as reducible, as required under the Court ’ s case-law under Article 3 in relation to life sentences, for two reasons. First, it was unclear whether before a 2006 amendment to the Criminal Code 1968 that had expressly provided that the presidential power of clemency extended to that type of sentence, the sentence had been de jure reducible. Secondly, the manner in which the presidential power of clemency had been exercised before the early months of 2012 had been quite opaque, and there had existed no concrete examples showing that persons serving sentences of life imprisonment without commutation could hope to benefit from the exercise of that power and obtain an adjustment of their sentence. Mr Harakchiev ’ s sentence could not therefore be regarded as de facto reducible before that time. The Court went on to say that although there was no right to rehabilitation under the Convention, its Article 3 required the Contracting States to give life prisoners a chance, however remote, to someday regain their freedom. For that chance to be genuine, those prisoners had to be given a proper opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. In that context, while Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation to decide on such things as the regime and conditions of a life prisoner ’ s incarceration, those points could not be considered as a matter of indifference. Mr Harakchiev had been subjected to a particularly stringent prison regime, which had entailed almost complete isolation and very limited possibilities for social contacts, work or education, and had been kept in unsatisfactory material conditions. He could not therefore be regarded as being able to entertain a real hope that he might one day achieve and demonstrate progress towards rehabilitation and on that basis seek an adjustment of his sentence. The Court accordingly found that there had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, but went on to caution that this finding was not to be understood as giving Mr Harakchiev the prospect of imminent release."

In the instant case, the applicant ’ s sentence of life imprisonment without commutation became final in 1999, and his very restrictive prison regime has apparently been maintained, with some variations, since that time, with no educational or other courses or group activities (see paragraphs 8, 10, 21, 27 and 30 above). In those circumstances, the Court sees no reason to depart from its ruling in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, §§ 247-67 ), and finds that there has been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. However, as in that case, the Court notes that this finding cannot be understood as giving the applicant the prospect of imminent release ( ibid., § 268 ).",

These principles, outlined in paragraph 5 2 above, are also in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 42 above) which are at the core of the concept of a fair trial and whose rationale relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused."
            ],
            [
                "54. In this respect, the Court underlines the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial ( see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission ’ s report of 12 July 1984, § 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 100, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, § 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, § 101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CPT ) ( see paragraphs 39 ‑ 40 above), in which the CPT repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies."

These time - limits should be much shorter than those set for adults.

Further, despite earlier affirmations to the contrary, the Turkish authorities made clear in their response to the report on the February/March 1999 visit that such persons are being denied during the first four days of their custody the possibility to inform a relative of their situation. Such incommunicado detention can only facilitate the infliction of ill - treatment.",

The CPT trusts that the Turkish authorities will in the near future implement the Committee ’ s long-standing recommendation that all persons deprived of their liberty by law enforcement agencies, including persons suspected of offences falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, be granted as from the outset of their custody the right of access to a lawyer.",

Similarly, the provision making obligatory the appointment of a lawyer for persons under 18 still does not apply to juveniles who are detained on suspicion of State Security Court offences.

The applicant also stressed that he had been a minor at the material time and had no previous criminal record.

Furthermore, in their submission, the restriction imposed on the applicant ’ s access to a lawyer had not infringed his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention. Referring to the case-law of the Court ( see, in particular, Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275; John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I; Averill v. the United Kingdom, no. 36408/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI; Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI; and Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ X ), they maintained that in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings. Thus, as the applicant had been represented by a lawyer during the proceedings before the İzmir State Security Court and the Court of Cassation, his right to a fair hearing had not been violated. The Government further drew attention to several Turkish cases ( see Saraç v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 35841/97, 2 September 2004; Yurtsever v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 42086/02, 31 August 2006; Uçma v.

The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 36). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 37, and Brennan, cited above, § 45 )."
            ],
            [
                "51. The Court further reiterates that although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial ( see Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 34, Series A no. 277 ‑ A, and Demebukov v. Bulgaria, no. 68020/01, § 50, 28 February 2008). Nevertheless, Article 6 § 3 (c) does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court ’ s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to “guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective” and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38 )."
            ],
            [
                "52. National laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings. In such circumstances, Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, § 63; Brennan, cited above, § 45; and Magee, cited above, § 44)."

These principles, outlined in paragraph 5 2 above, are also in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 42 above) which are at the core of the concept of a fair trial and whose rationale relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused."
            ],
            [
                "54. In this respect, the Court underlines the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial ( see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission ’ s report of 12 July 1984, § 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 100, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, § 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, § 101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CPT ) ( see paragraphs 39 ‑ 40 above), in which the CPT repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies."

Against this background, the Court finds that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently “practical and effective” (see paragraph 51 above), Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee, cited above, § 44). The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.",

In the present case, the applicant ’ s right of access to a lawyer was restricted during his police custody, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, he did not have access to a lawyer when he made his statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively. Thus, no other justification was given for denying the applicant access to a lawyer than the fact that this was provided for on a systematic basis by the relevant legal provisions. As such, this already falls short of the requirements of Article 6 in this respect, as set out at paragraph 5 2 above."

During the ensuing criminal proceedings, he was also able to call witnesses on his behalf and had the possibility of challenging the prosecution ’ s arguments. It is also noted that the applicant repeatedly denied the content of his statement to the police, both at the trial and on appeal. However, as is apparent from the case file, the investigation had in large part been completed before the applicant appeared before the investigating judge on 1 June 2001. Moreover, not only did the İzmir State Security Court not take a stance on the admissibility of the applicant ’ s statements made in police custody before going on to examine the merits of the case, it also used the statement to the police as the main evidence on which to convict him, despite his denial of its accuracy (see paragraph 23 above). In this connection, the Court observes that in convicting the applicant, the İzmir State Security Court in fact used the evidence before it to confirm the applicant ’ s statement to the police. This evidence included the expert ’ s report dated 1 June 2001 and the statements of the other accused to the police and the public prosecutor. In this respect, however, the Court finds it striking that the expert ’ s report mentioned in the judgment of the first-instance court was in favour of the applicant, as it stated that it could not be established whether the handwriting on the banner matched the applicant ’ s (see paragraph 15 above). It is also significant that all the co-defendants, who had testified against the applicant in their statements to the police and the public prosecutor, retracted their statements at the trial and denied having participated in the demonstration."

Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 157, ECHR 2009 ). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see Ülke v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 39437/98, 1 June 2004 ). As long as the situation continues, the six-month rule is not applicable (see Iordache v. Romania, no. 6817/02, § 50, 14 October 2008 ). The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, 4 December 2007). The Court found previously that in the situation of a repetition of the same events, such as, for example, an applicant ’ s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court ’ s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court ’ s competence (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, § 75, 17 January 2012 ).

The applicants, who have implied that as a consequence of that situation there were no domestic remedies to be exhausted, ought therefore to have lodged their applications with the Court no later than six months from the cessation of the situation complained of, in order to comply with the six ‑ month rule. By lodging their applications on 5 May 2008 and 2 July 2008, respectively, at the time when the third trial was pending, the applicants complied with that rule in relation to their confinement in a cage during the third trial only. The Court will therefore disregard their confinement in a cage during the first and second trials which ended in 2004 and 2006 – more than six months before the dates on which the applications were introduced – as falling outside the scope of its examination (see, mutatis mutandis, Cyprus v.

In addition, defendants were not restricted in their movements by wrist or ankle shackles and were free to take more comfortable postures.

During that period there had been nothing to justify those fears, that is, nothing to suggest that he had threatened the victims and witnesses or committed any other unlawful acts against them. In the decision of 8 February 2005 the Magadan Regional Court had imposed on the applicants an undertaking not to leave their place of residence as a preventive measure, which restriction had lasted ten months. The court and the prosecution, which had not appealed against that decision, had not considered that the applicants posed a danger to society. There had been no grounds on which to change that preventive measure to detention on remand on 6 December 2005. Mr Slyadnev had been detained on the same grounds as his co-defendant Mr Grishin.

This practice was once standard after the break - up of the Soviet Union in some of the Contracting States which had previously been Republics of the latter, but it has since largely been abandoned. Even those few Contracting States which retain that practice, including the respondent State, have started the process of removing metal cages from courtrooms (see paragraphs 75 and 101 above)."

The Government argued that the violent nature of the crimes with which the applicants had been charged, together with their criminal records, negative references from the places of their residence and the witnesses ’ fears of the applicants ’ unlawful behaviour, were sufficient to confirm their predisposition to violence and the existence of real security risks in the courtroom such as to justify recourse to a cage for ensuring the proper conditions for holding the trial. The applicants disagreed, arguing, in particular, that the first applicant ’ s full acquittal and the second applicant ’ s acquittal on most of the charges, including banditry and robbery, had confirmed that the charges against them had been unfounded, and that this in any event could not be a relevant argument in view of the principle of the presumption of innocence."

It is not the Court ’ s task to discuss questions concerning the architecture of the courtroom, nor to give indications as to what specific measures of physical restraint may be necessary. However, the means chosen for ensuring such order and security must not involve measures of restraint which by virtue of their level of severity (see paragraph 114 above) or by their very nature would bring them within the scope of Article 3.

The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Rules of Procedure of international criminal tribunals provide, with regard to certain instruments of restraint, that they may be used only as a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they are removed once the accused appears before a court (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above).

Its continued practice can therefore hardly be understood otherwise than as a means of degrading and humiliating the caged person. The object of humiliating and debasing the person held in a cage during a trial is thus apparent."

On this latter point, in any event, the Court does not accept that such a threat has been substantiated. It observes that the Magadan Regional Court never assessed whether the applicants ’ physical restraint was at all necessary during the hearings. Moreover no reasons were given for keeping the applicants in a cage. Nor can those reasons be found in court detention orders, contrary to the Government ’ s submissions that the applicants posed a threat to witnesses, and that it was this threat that warranted their detention on remand. The first applicant was not remanded in custody for the duration of the third trial. He was detained on remand in unrelated proceedings for reasons that are not known (see paragraphs 34 and 46 above). The second applicant ’ s detention was ordered by the same court decisions as those which the Court has examined in the case of the applicants ’ co ‑ defendant and found to lack “relevant and sufficient” reasons for detention on remand to be compatible with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, and, in particular, to lack reasons which would show the risk of retaliation against, or pressure on, the witnesses now alleged by the Government (see Mikhail Grishin, cited above, §§ 149-150). That conclusion is fully applicable to the present case, and there is nothing in the Government ’ s submissions to the Grand Chamber which would warrant departing from it. Nor can the accusations that the applicants had committed violent crimes or their previous convictions – some of them with conditional sentences – six or more years before the trial in question, or the first applicant ’ s subsequent conviction, be reasonably considered to support the Government ’ s submissions in this respect. As to the negative references referred to by the Government (see paragraph 96 above), they do not suggest that the applicants ’ personalities were such as to require their physical restraint during their trial; and the second applicant also had positive references from the administrations of his remand centre and prison (see paragraph 44 above)."

In the present case, the use of the security installation was not warranted by any specific security risks or courtroom order issues but was a matter of routine. As follows from the parties ’ submissions, the trial court had no discretion to order the defendants ’ placement outside the cabin, although it could change the courtroom for another one, with more cabins. The trial court did not seem to recognise the impact of these courtroom arrangements on the applicant ’ s defence rights, and did not take any measures to compensate for these limitations. Such circumstances prevailed for the whole duration of the first-instance hearing, which lasted for over eight months, including seven months in hearing room no. 635, and could not but adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings as a whole."

Even though he was unable to specify the size of the vans and the number of inmates carried in them, the description of the seating arrangements is sufficient for the Court to accept that the detainees were transported in cramped conditions.

The applicant further complained that the intensive schedule of the court hearings and late arrivals back at the detention facility did not leave him sufficient time to prepare for the next day ’ s hearings. The lack of sleep compounded by lengthy transfers from the detention facility in difficult conditions led to physical exhaustion and diminished his ability to participate in the proceedings and to defend himself effectively.

Russia, no. 10877/04, § 45, 23 October 2008; Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07, 25924/08 and 14599/09, § 80, 21 October 2010; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 37, 24 July 2012; Gün and Others v.

                "169. The Government argued that the applicant ’ s punishment for participation in mass disorder and using violence against the police officer related to acts unconnected with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of assembly. The Court observes that the acts imputed to the applicant included chanting anti-government slogans during the dispersal of the assembly and throwing an unidentified round yellow object in the direction of the police cordon; the object hit police officer F. causing no injury. The Court has previously examined a number of cases where the demonstrators had engaged in acts of violence and found that the demonstrations in questions had been within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention on the basis that the organisers of these assemblies had not expressed violent intentions and there were no grounds to believe that the assemblies were not meant to be peaceful. The Court found that the applicants in those cases enjoyed the protection of Article 11 of the Convention and examined whether the measures taken against them were justified under the second paragraph of this provision. In one of these cases it found a violation of Article 11 of the Convention on account of a disproportionate sentence imposed on the applicant for attending a demonstration and throwing stones at the security forces (see Gülcü v. Turkey, no. 17526/10, § § 91-97, 19 January 2016 ). In other cases it found that the authorities ’ response to violence had been proportionate and complied with Article 11 of the Convention (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; Protopapa v. Turkey, no. 16084/90, §§ 104-12, 24 February 2009; and Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, §§ 156-63, 12 June 2014 )."

                "170. In the present case, the Government argued that the disruption of the previously peaceful assembly had been engineered by the organisers to stir up political unrest. They accused the assembly leaders of encouraging the protesters to bring tents to set up an illegal campsite and of breaking through the police cordon with the intention of marching outside the officially designated venue. Only the first of those two claims is supported by evidence : the police had indeed intercepted several attempts to bring tents to Bolotnaya Square. Also, Mr Udaltsov has called on the protesters to begin an “indefinite protest action” on the site of the cancelled meeting, although this could be a reaction to the developments on the spot. On any interpretation, the authorities ’ fear of an illegal long-term campsite being erected in the park of Bolotanaya Square had some foundation."

                "171. As regards the breaking through the police cordon, nothing in the case file confirms that that was the organisers ’ desired outcome. On the contrary, the Court has previously found that the sit-in began because of the unexpected change of the venue layout, of which the police had not informed the organisers (see Frumkin, cited above, §§ 113-16 ). The march leaders spent about 45 minutes peacefully waiting for the confusion about the placement of the cordon to be resolved, to no avail. Above all, whatever the organisers ’ intentions were, they made no call for violence and showed no signs that they had been prepared for it. The security screening at the entrances to the assembly venue, which was rather thorough, did not detect the presence of weapons or other objectionable equipment carried by the protesters, apart from a handful of tents, possibly prohibited but inherently harmless items. The round yellow object tossed by the applicant in the instant case remained unidentified but appeared, by all accounts, innocuous (compare with Primov and Others, cited above, §§ 158-59, where the protesters carried iron rods, wooden sticks, knives and firearms ). The fact that the applicant was chanting political slogans like “One for all and all for one!” or “United, we are invincible!” cannot be taken as evidence that he had violent intentions."

In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the assembly at Bolotnaya Square fell within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention and accepts that the applicant enjoyed the protection of this provision.

The applicant contested that the events which took place at Bolotnaya Square constituted mass disorder within the meaning of Article 212 of the Criminal Code, and that his own acts could qualify as participation in such disorder. He insisted that the assembly as a whole had remained peaceful while the police had used excessive force against the protesters, which led to some isolated clashes; in any event, there had been no disorder of a scale required to fall under this provision. The Government, on the contrary, alleged that the clashes had been the product of a premeditated and organised plot by the assembly leaders, and only the timely and efficient intervention by the police had prevented the escalation of violence to extreme and devastating consequences."

The court observes that Russian law does not contain a definition of “mass disorder”, and it accepts that this term might be imprecise, akin to “riot” or “breach of public order”, which it has already examined in a similar context (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 113-14). Having noted that it would be unrealistic to require a legislator to formulate general rules without some degree of abstraction, the Court considered that the requirement of lawfulness would be satisfied if the domestic courts ’ interpretation of these terms was neither arbitrary nor unpredictable, and if their use bore reasonable relation to the circumstances at hand."

In the present case, the Court is sensitive to the applicant ’ s arguments that the incidents of disorderly behaviour and violence were localised and, moreover, that they were compounded by the authorities ’ own conduct. Even so, it was the scale rather than the nature of the events that might have placed them at the limit of Article 212 of the Criminal Code, but the applicability of this provision was not entirely inconceivable. Even if the Court were to disagree with the domestic courts ’ assessment of the situation, it considers that they took their decision after a thorough assessment of all the relevant evidence and within the margin of their judicial discretion. As such, the applicant ’ s criminal conviction may not be considered “unlawful” on the grounds put forward by the applicant. The question whether it was justified to apply this provision to the applicant personally will be examined under the head of proportionality (see paragraph 177 et seq. below)."

                "177. As to whether the applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes that the applicant was found guilty of two criminal offences, namely participation in mass disorder (Article 212 of the Criminal Code) and of violent acts against police officers (Article 318 of the Criminal Code). Under these provisions he was sentenced to two years and three months ’ imprisonment for attending an authorised public assembly, chanting anti -government slogans, and throwing an unidentified small round object which hit a police officer on the shoulder and caused him pain. It is noteworthy that the sentence under Article 318 for using violence against a public official, namely for throwing the yellow object, that of nine months ’ imprisonment, although already a severe one, was significantly more lenient than the partly concurrent twenty-one-month sentence for participation in mass disorder."
            ],
            [
                "178. The main justification advanced by the Government for such a harsh sentence was the serious risk of potential civil unrest, in particular the threat to political stability and public order. The gravity of the punishment was thus attributable to the general context in which the applicant had assaulted the policeman, and not to the harm he had actually caused. In any event, the physical damage caused by the yellow object to officer F. was limited to short-term pain. Regard being had to other acts imputed to the applicant, it turns out that the applicant ’ s staying at the site of the rally and chanting anti-government slogans accounted for a staggering one ‑ and ‑ a ‑ half-year addition to his prison term. These acts, unlike tossing the yellow object, were peaceful and constituted protest, a form of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Taranenko, cited above, § 70, and the cases cited therein ). If the domestic courts were to take into account that the applicant had committed those acts in connection with the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, they should have considered it a mitigating factor. Quite to the contrary, they penalised the applicant for the political message he intended to express by his presence at the venue and by chanting non-violent political slogans."

In the present case, the Court considers it crucial that the applicant was not found to be among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression; he threw the yellow object at the height of the clashes, when the police were already arresting the protesters. The domestic courts also noted that the applicant ’ s participation in mass disorder had been insignificant and gave him on that basis a sentence below the three-year statutory minimum, although still an extremely heavy one."

Given the applicant ’ s minor role in the assembly and his only marginal involvement in the clashes, the Court does not consider that the risks referred to by the Government – potential civil unrest, political instability and threat to public order – had any personal relation to the applicant. These reasons could not therefore justify the sentence of two years and three months, which was, moreover, served in full. The Court considers that there was no “pressing social need” to sentence the applicant to a prison term of this duration."

The penitentiary had a medical unit, where the applicant was placed when required, and his conditions could to a certain extent be treated in that unit. When the need arose, he was transferred to another hospital in Dnipropetrovsk, where he received supplementary treatment (see paragraph 17 above). The Court notes that the applicant did not dispute or criticise the comment of the prison administration of August 2006, according to which he was being provided with medical treatment in accordance with the established diagnoses (see paragraph 19 above). His disagreement with the diagnoses issued by the prison doctors stems not from an allegation of inadequacy of the medical treatment, but rather from his frustration over the fact that they did not make him eligible for potential early release."

France, judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 296-A, p. 18, § 33). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made - at least in substance - to the appropriate domestic body in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Cardot v. France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, § 34). However, only effective remedies are required to be exhausted. The remedy must be “ effective ” in practice as well as in law (see, for example, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 97, ECHR 2000-VII).

Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003-VIII).

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey, 28 November 1997, § 57, Reports 1997 ‑ VIII). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see e.g. Dankevich v. Ukraine, no. 40679/98, § 107, 29 April 2003). A mere doubt as to the prospect of success is not sufficient to exempt an applicant from submitting a complaint to the competent court (see, for example, Plyatsevyy v.

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that in order to exhaust either of the two remedies advanced by the Government, the applicant should have raised his complaint before the domestic courts – either by first complaining to the prosecutor, which he did, and then challenging his response, if necessary, to the domestic courts (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above ), which he failed to do; or by applying directly to the administrative court with a complaint against the prison administration (see paragraph 44 above), which he also failed to do. Under both scenarios it would ultimately be the courts'task to decide whether the administration's action was in compliance with the law."

The Court accepts that there are no detailed procedures envisaged for raising this particular type of complaints before the domestic courts and that the Government failed to cite any examples of their handling in practice. However, the question fell within the scope of paragraph 1 of Article 17 of the Code of Administrative Justice of 6 July 2005 (see paragraph 44 above), which defines the jurisdiction of administrative courts, and there is no suggestion that the dispute in the present case was excluded by paragraph 2 of that provision. Therefore, the Court considers that in the circumstances of this case there are no prima facie doubts as to the accessibility of this remedy in practice, which might be the case should the jurisdiction delimitation lack clarity. The Court further notes that the administrative courts had sufficient powers to recognise the impugned interference with the applicant's correspondence unlawful, to oblige the prison administration to abstain from such interferences in the future and to charge compensation for the damage should any be found. It follows that this remedy was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaint and offered reasonable prospects of success."

While the obligation imposed is of a procedural nature, distinguishable from the substantive rights set out in the Convention and Protocols, it flows from the very essence of this procedural right that it is open to individuals to complain of its alleged infringements in Convention proceedings (see Manoussos v. the Czech Republic and Germany (dec.), no. 46468/99, 9 July 2002).

In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation, but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention complaint (see the above-mentioned Kurt and Şarlı cases, §§ 160 and 164, and §§ 85-86 respectively)."

The opening of letters from the Court or addressed to it, with or without reading their contents, undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that it may conceivably, on occasion, also create the risk of reprisals by prison staff against the prisoner concerned. The opening of letters by prison authorities can have an intimidating effect on applicants and therefore hinder them in bringing their cases to the Court (see Klyakhin v.

The Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify different treatment. The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background.

The regime of his detention was governed by Law no. 275/2006 on the execution of sentences. Under that legislation, all accused persons detained during investigations and judicial proceedings were only entitled to receive ordinary visits, which took place in the visiting area of the prison through a separation wall and under visual surveillance by prison guards. Convicted prisoners had in addition the right to a conjugal visit of up to two hours every three months (see paragraph 25 above)."

            [
                "59. The Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the grounds for imposing pre-trial detention and thus limiting the suspect ’ s contacts with the outside world serve to guarantee an unhindered investigation. That being so, it also observes that Article 10 § 2 (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires, inter alia, that accused persons should, save in exceptional circumstances, be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons who enjoy the right to be presumed innocent (see paragraph 27 above). The 1987 European Prison Rules contain an analogous rule. Similarly, the 2006 European Prison Rules, provide that unless there is a specific prohibition for a specified period by the judicial authority in an individual case, untried prisoners are to receive visits and be allowed to communicate with family members in the same way as convicted prisoners ( see paragraph 27 above). This approach appears to be supported by the CPT, which considered that any restriction on a remand prisoner ’ s right to receive visits should be based on the requirements of the investigation or security considerations, be applied for a limited period and be the least severe possible (see paragraph 28 above). Romanian legislation, however, restricts remand prisoners ’ visiting rights in a general manner and to a greater extent than those of convicted persons placed in a prison, as in the applicant ’ s case. In this regard the Court has already had occasion to hold that, as far as specific restrictions on a detained person ’ s visiting rights are concerned, the aim of protecting the legitimate interests of an investigation may also be achieved by other means which do not affect all detained persons, regardless of whether they are actually required, such as the setting up of different categories of detention, or particular restrictions as may be required by the circumstances of an individual case (see Laduna, cited above, § 66, and Varnas, cited above, § 119 )."

                "60. As to the reasonableness of the justification of difference in treatment between remand detainees and convicted prisoners, the Court acknowledges that the applicant in the instant case had been charged with conspiracy to commit crimes and blackmail. However, it also finds that security considerations relating to any criminal family links were absent in the instant case (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, §§ 65-67, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). Namely, the applicant ’ s wife was neither a witness nor a co ‑ accused in the criminal case against her husband, which removed the risk of collusion or other forms of obstructing the process of collecting evidence (see, in contrast, mutatis mutandis, Silickienė v. Lithuania, no. 20496/02, §§ 28 and 29, 10 April 2012). Nor has the Court any information to the effect that the applicant ’ s wife was involved in criminal activities. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that there was a particular reason to prevent the applicant from having conjugal visits from his wife (see, by contrast, Klamecki v. Poland (no. 2), no. 31583/96, § 135, 3 April 2003; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Kučera v. Slovakia, no. 48666/99, § 130, 17 July 2007). Above all, the Court notes that in justifying the prohibition on the applicant having conjugal visits when placed in pre-trial detention, the Government, like the domestic prison authorities and the Gherla District Court, in essence relied on the legal norms as such, without any reference as to why those prohibitions had been necessary and justified in the applicant ’ s specific situation."

The applicant complained about the refusal of his requests for conjugal visits throughout his pre-trial detention, for a significantly lengthy period, totalling one year and ten months. Irrespective of the length of detention, under the domestic law a person being held in pre-trial detention was not entitled to conjugal visits, in contrast with a person already convicted, who had such a right. The applicant considered that such a difference in treatment lacked justification. In his view, although his guilt had not yet been established, he had to face much more serious restrictions than those already convicted. Lastly, he alleged that the lack of conjugal visits led to the dissolution of his marriage, which also caused him significant suffering, because he had two children."

Firstly, they pointed out that a difference in treatment did exist between persons in pre-trial detention and convicted prisoners with respect to their right to conjugal visits, but that such a difference was “prescribed by law” (see paragraphs 24 - 26 above). They further considered that distinguishing between the two above-mentioned categories of persons deprived of their liberty had a legitimate aim. The restriction in question was required as a security measure to prevent further crimes from being committed or to ensure that criminal proceedings were not impeded. The grounds for imposing pre-trial detention were also to ensure that the suspect would not obstruct the investigation by tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses. The Government concluded that the difference of treatment was objectively and reasonably justified within the scope of Article 14 of the Convention. Lastly, the Government considered it worth noting that the applicant ’ s requests for ordinary visits had never been refused by the prison administration, and as a result he had benefited from a large number of visits from his family during his detention."

The Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention protects individuals in similar situations from being treated differently without justification in the enjoyment of their Convention rights and freedoms. This provision has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. However, the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions, and to this extent it is autonomous. For Article 14 to become applicable, it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see Varnas, cited above, § 106 )."

However, it is an essential part of a detainee ’ s right to respect for family life that the authorities enable him, or if need be assist him, in maintaining contact with his immediate family. Such restrictions as limitations imposed on the number of family visits, supervision over those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visit arrangements, constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8, but are not of themselves in breach of that provision (see, among other authorities, Bogusław Krawczak v. Poland, no. 24205/06, §§ 107-108, 31 May 2011, and Trosin v. Ukraine, no. 39758/05, § 39, 23 February 2012)."

However, while the Court has expressed its approval for the evolution in several European countries towards conjugal visits, it has not so far interpreted the Convention as requiring Contracting States to make provision for such visits. Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 81, ECHR 2007 ‑ V)."

The Court accepts that the prohibition of conjugal visits which the applicant had complained of comes within the ambit of Article 8 (see, by contrast, Epners-Gefners v. Latvia, no. 37862/02, § 65, 29 May 2012). The Court accordingly concludes that Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Article 8, is applicable in the present case (see E.B. v.

The Court is therefore satisfied, and it has not been disputed between the parties, that by the fact of being remanded in custody the applicant fell within the notion of “other status” within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Shelley v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 23800/06, 4 January 2008, and Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, §§ 55-63, 13 July 2010)."

The requirement to demonstrate an “analogous position” does not mean that the comparator groups must be identical. The fact that the applicant ’ s situation is not fully analogous to that of convicted prisoners and that there are differences between the various groups based on the purpose of their deprivation of liberty does not preclude the application of Article 14. It must be shown that, having regard to the particular nature of his complaint, the applicant was in a relevantly similar situation to others who were treated differently (see Clift, cited above, § 66)."

The regime of his detention was governed by Law no. 275/2006 on the execution of sentences. Under that legislation, all accused persons detained during investigations and judicial proceedings were only entitled to receive ordinary visits, which took place in the visiting area of the prison through a separation wall and under visual surveillance by prison guards. Convicted prisoners had in addition the right to a conjugal visit of up to two hours every three months (see paragraph 25 above)."

                "59. The Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the grounds for imposing pre-trial detention and thus limiting the suspect ’ s contacts with the outside world serve to guarantee an unhindered investigation. That being so, it also observes that Article 10 § 2 (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires, inter alia, that accused persons should, save in exceptional circumstances, be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons who enjoy the right to be presumed innocent (see paragraph 27 above). The 1987 European Prison Rules contain an analogous rule. Similarly, the 2006 European Prison Rules, provide that unless there is a specific prohibition for a specified period by the judicial authority in an individual case, untried prisoners are to receive visits and be allowed to communicate with family members in the same way as convicted prisoners ( see paragraph 27 above). This approach appears to be supported by the CPT, which considered that any restriction on a remand prisoner ’ s right to receive visits should be based on the requirements of the investigation or security considerations, be applied for a limited period and be the least severe possible (see paragraph 28 above). Romanian legislation, however, restricts remand prisoners ’ visiting rights in a general manner and to a greater extent than those of convicted persons placed in a prison, as in the applicant ’ s case. In this regard the Court has already had occasion to hold that, as far as specific restrictions on a detained person ’ s visiting rights are concerned, the aim of protecting the legitimate interests of an investigation may also be achieved by other means which do not affect all detained persons, regardless of whether they are actually required, such as the setting up of different categories of detention, or particular restrictions as may be required by the circumstances of an individual case (see Laduna, cited above, § 66, and Varnas, cited above, § 119 )."

                "60. As to the reasonableness of the justification of difference in treatment between remand detainees and convicted prisoners, the Court acknowledges that the applicant in the instant case had been charged with conspiracy to commit crimes and blackmail. However, it also finds that security considerations relating to any criminal family links were absent in the instant case (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, §§ 65-67, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). Namely, the applicant ’ s wife was neither a witness nor a co ‑ accused in the criminal case against her husband, which removed the risk of collusion or other forms of obstructing the process of collecting evidence (see, in contrast, mutatis mutandis, Silickienė v. Lithuania, no. 20496/02, §§ 28 and 29, 10 April 2012). Nor has the Court any information to the effect that the applicant ’ s wife was involved in criminal activities. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that there was a particular reason to prevent the applicant from having conjugal visits from his wife (see, by contrast, Klamecki v. Poland (no. 2), no. 31583/96, § 135, 3 April 2003; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Kučera v. Slovakia, no. 48666/99, § 130, 17 July 2007). Above all, the Court notes that in justifying the prohibition on the applicant having conjugal visits when placed in pre-trial detention, the Government, like the domestic prison authorities and the Gherla District Court, in essence relied on the legal norms as such, without any reference as to why those prohibitions had been necessary and justified in the applicant ’ s specific situation."
