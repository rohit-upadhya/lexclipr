Accordingly, the applicant ’ s conduct in 1944 could and should have been analysed under Latvian and international law, rather than Soviet law.

The indictment alleged that they were responsible for having gassed thousands of inhabitants of Kharkov and its region, of committing brutal atrocities against civilians, of having burnt villages and exterminated women, old people and children as well as of having executed, burnt alive and tortured the wounded and prisoners of war. The prosecution relied on the rules of war laid down by international conventions ( the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations and the 1929 Geneva Convention, noting that Germany had ratified both) and universally accepted provisions of international law. The indictment not only referred to the responsibility of the German Government and Command, but to the individual responsibility of the accused (referring to the “ Leipzig trials ” ). After admitting their own and their hierarchical superiors ’ guilt, the three accused were sentenced to death by hanging.

Many of these prohibitions had been enforced long before the date of the Convention; but since 1907 they have certainly been crimes, punishable as offences against the laws of war; yet the Hague Convention [(IV)] nowhere designates such practices as criminal, nor is any sentence prescribed, nor any mention made of a court to try and punish offenders. For many years past, however, military tribunals have tried and punished individuals guilty of violating the rules of land warfare laid down by this Convention. ... In interpreting the words of the [Kellogg-Briand Pact], it must be remembered that international law is not the product of an international legislature, and that such international agreements as the [Kellogg-Briand Pact] have to deal with general principles of law, and not with administrative matters of procedure. The law of war is to be found not only in treaties, but in the customs and practices of States which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principles of justice applied by jurists and practised by military courts. This law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world.

Although the obligation to observe the provisions of the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] as a binding treaty may be swept away by operation of the ‘ general participation clause ’, or otherwise, the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] remains as good evidence of the customary law of nations, to be considered by the Tribunal along with all other available evidence in determining the customary law to be applied in any given situation. ...”"

The Court ’ s role under that provision was to establish whether there was a legal provision defining certain acts as a crime formulated with sufficient clarity and accessibility and, in particular, whether the Latvian courts had the right to rely on section 68-3 of the 1961 Criminal Code and, in doing so, to rely on the relevant elements of international law. In this respect, the offence could be defined in written and unwritten, domestic or international law and Article 7 did not outlaw gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation so long as the resultant development was consistent with the essence of the offence.

In any event, any such Partisan tribunal judgment would have been unlawful as it would have been delivered in absentia in violation of even the basic tenets of a fair trial. The respondent Government had submitted to the Chamber letters dated February 2008 from the Prosecutor General ’ s Office (about the existence of the Partisan tribunal, the role of Mazie Bati and its villagers in the German defence and why arms had been issued to the villagers) and resubmitted these to the Grand Chamber."

During that Soviet occupation, Latvia was prevented from exercising its sovereign powers, including its international obligations. Apart from the resultant fear of the local population of the Red Partisans, it was a distortion for the applicant to suggest that the events of 27 May 1944 in Mazie Bati were a civil war incident as opposed to part of the international armed conflict opposing the Axis powers and, inter alia, the USSR."

In any event, even if they had lost that status and were to be considered “combatants”, nothing allowed the summary execution and murder of any person hors de combat unless a fair trial had taken place (and there was no proof of this) wherein it was established that they were indeed implicated in a criminal offence. Moreover, these were not lawful acts of “lawful belligerent reprisals” since, inter alia, such actions had been prohibited against prisoners of war since the 1929 Geneva Convention and, as regards civilians, it was never suggested that the villagers committed war crimes themselves."

His conviction was also objectively foreseeable given, inter alia, the declarations of certain States during the Second World War and the international and national prosecutions during and immediately after that war, in which processes the Soviet authorities had much involvement. That he was a Soviet war hero for years thereafter was not relevant: the key point was whether the acts could have been reasonably foreseen in 1944 as amounting to war crimes and not that his later fortuitous political situation would have excluded his prosecution. Neither was it a defence to argue that others committed war crimes to avoid individual criminal liability, unless the departure from principle by other States was sufficient to constitute evidence of a change in international usage and custom."

Whether such “general principles” were a primary or secondary source of international law, they were derived from national systems to fill gaps in positive and customary international law. In the absence of any consensus as to the survey of national systems required to establish such principles, the respondent Government reviewed jurisdictions which had, by 1944, already pronounced on the subject of war crimes as well as the Criminal Codes of Latvia and the USSR.

This was because he was bound by those instruments only as regards the international armed conflict between Germany and the USSR and not as regards acts between co ‑ citizens of the same State: Latvia was de jure part of the USSR in 1944 and the villagers (although de facto under German instruction) were de jure Soviet citizens so that he and the villagers had USSR citizenship. Contrary to the submissions of the respondent and Lithuanian Governments, this Court was not competent to re-evaluate history and, notably, the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR in 1940. They relied on “relevant binding instruments of international law” (in which the sovereignty of the USSR throughout its territory was recognised) and to post-Second World War meetings (in which the post-Second World War order was established by agreement with the United States of America and the United Kingdom ). Having regard to the criteria in international law for defining an “occupation”, the USSR was not an occupying power in Latvia in 1944.",

Having regard to the principle of distinction and the criteria for defining a “ combatant ” ( inter alia, Article 1 of the Hague Regulations), the applicant was a combatant trained, armed and acting in execution of the ruling of an ad hoc Partisan tribunal on behalf of the Soviet military administration. The villagers were militia, armed and actively collaborating with the German military administration. As willing collaborators, the villagers were taking an active part in hostilities and therefore met all the criteria for being classed as “ combatants ” (or, at best, “ unlawful enemy combatants ” ) and were thus legitimate military targets. Finally, none of the subsequent international instruments ( the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or the 1977 Protocol Additional ) were applicable as they could not apply retrospectively."

                "179. The first issue concerned the legal status of the Baltic States during the Second World War and other related issues of international law. Contrary to paragraph 118 of the Chamber judgment, the Lithuanian Government considered that this issue had to be taken into account when examining notably the legal status of the belligerent forces in the Baltic States at the time. Indeed, the Court had already recognised that all three Baltic States had lost their independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ( the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 and its secret Protocol, the Treaty on Borders and Friendly Relations of 1939 and its secret Protocol, as well as the third Nazi-Soviet secret Protocol of 10 January 1941): the Pact was an undisputed historical fact, an illegal agreement to commit aggression against, inter alia, the Baltic States and resulted in their illegal occupation by Soviet forces. Indeed, the Soviet invasion of the Baltic States in June 1940 was an act of aggression within the meaning of the London Convention on the Definition of Aggression of 1933 and the Convention between Lithuania and the USSR on the Definition of Aggression of 1933. The involuntary consent of the Baltic States faced with Soviet aggression did not render this act of aggression lawful.",
                "The USSR itself had earlier treated the Anschluss as an international crime. In addition, in 1989 the USSR recognised ( in the Resolution on the Political and Juridical Appraisal of the Soviet-German Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939) its unlawful aggression against the Baltic States. Two conclusions followed: the USSR had not obtained any sovereign rights to the Baltic States so that under international law the Baltic States were never a legitimate part of the USSR and, additionally, the Baltic States continued to exist as international legal persons after the 1940 aggression by the USSR which aggression resulted in the illegal occupation of the Baltic States.",
                "Applying that to the facts in the present case, the Lithuanian Government argued that the Baltic States suffered aggression from the USSR and Nazi Germany: the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg characterised aggression in such a way as to treat both aggressors in the same manner. The Baltic peoples had no particular reason to feel sympathy with either and, indeed, had rational fears against both aggressors (in this respect, the Lithuanian Government take issue with paragraph 130 of the Chamber judgment given the well-established historical fact of USSR crimes in the Baltic States) so that a degree of collaboration with one aggressor in self-defence should not be treated differently. The peoples of the Baltic States could not be considered to have been Soviet citizens, as they retained under international law their Baltic nationality, but were rather inhabitants of an occupied State who sought safety from both occupying belligerent forces."
            ],
            [
                "180. The second issue concerned the characterisation, under international humanitarian and criminal law, of the punitive acts of the Soviet forces against the local Baltic populations and, in particular, whether those populations could be considered to be “combatants”.",
                "A number of instruments were relevant, in addition to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations, especially the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) and the 1977 Protocol Additional. It was a core principle of international humanitarian law in 1944 that there was a fundamental distinction between armed forces (belligerents) and the peaceful populations (civilians) and that the latter enjoyed immunity from military attack ( in that respect, they cited the Martens Clause; see paragraphs 86 to 87 above). The villagers did not meet the criteria defining “ combatants ” and were not therefore a lawful military target. Even if there had been some degree of collaboration by the villagers with the German forces, they had to retain civilian protection unless they met the “ combatant ” criteria: the opposite view would leave a population at the mercy of belligerent commanders who could arbitrarily decide that they were combatants and thus a legitimate military target. The killing of the women, unless they were taking part in hostilities as combatants, was not in any circumstances justified, as it would always have been contrary to the most elementary considerations and laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience. In that regard, the Government specifically took issue with paragraphs 141 and 142 the Chamber judgment."

            ],
            [
                "185. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written and unwritten law and which implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability. As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; K. ‑ H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, §§ 10 1 -0 9, ECHR 2007-III; and Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, §§ 69-71, ECHR 2008 )."

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws ( see X. v. Belgium, no. 268/57, Commission decision of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, p. 241). In any event, the Court further notes that the definition of war crimes included in Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was found to be declaratory of international laws and customs of war as understood in 1939 ( see paragraphs 118 above and 207 below)."

While arms and munitions supplied by the German military administration were found in the deceased villagers ’ homes, none of those villagers were carrying those or any arms.

However, the domestic courts did not charge the applicant with a separate war crime on this basis. This factor does have some bearing, nonetheless, on other related war crimes of which he was accused (notably, treacherous killing and wounding, see paragraph 217 below).

While the notion of war crimes can be traced back centuries, the mid-nineteenth century saw a period of solid codification of the acts constituting a war crime and for which an individual could be held criminally liable. The Lieber Code 1863 ( see paragraphs 63-77 above) outlined a multitude of offences against the laws and customs of war and prescribed punishments, and individual criminal responsibility was inherent in numerous of its Articles [33]. While it was an American Code, it was the first modern codification of the laws and customs of war and was influential in later codification conferences, notably in Brussels in 1874 ( see paragraph 79 above). The Oxford Manual 1880 forbade a multitude of acts as contrary to the laws and customs of war and explicitly provided for “offenders to be liable to punishment specified in the penal law”. These earlier codifications, and in particular the Draft Brussels Declaration 1874, in turn inspired the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. These latter instruments were the most influential of the earlier codifications and were, in 1907, declaratory of the laws and customs of war: they defined, inter alia, relevant key notions (combatants, levée en masse, hors de combat ), they listed detailed offences against the laws and customs of war and they provided a residual protection, through the Martens Clause, to inhabitants and belligerents for cases not covered by the specific provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. Responsibility therein was on States, which had to issue consistent instructions to their armed forces and pay compensation if their armed forces violated those rules.",

The work of the International Commission in 1919 (after the First World War) and of the United Nations War Crimes Commission ( UNWCC ) (during the Second World War) made significant contributions to the principle of individual criminal liability in international law. “Geneva law” (notably the Conventions of 1864, 1906 and 1929; see paragraphs 53 to 62 above) protected the victims of war and provided safeguards for disabled armed forces personnel and persons not taking part in hostilities.

There was agreement in contemporary doctrine that international law had already defined war crimes and required individuals to be prosecuted [34]. In consequence, the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was not ex post facto criminal legislation. The later Nuremberg Principles, drawn from the Charter and judgment of the IMT Nuremberg, reiterated the definition of war crimes set out in the Charter and that anyone committing a crime under international law was responsible and liable to punishment [35]."

International prosecution through the IMTs was the exception, the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg explicitly recognising the continuing role of the domestic courts. Accordingly, the international liability of the State based on treaties and conventions [36] did not preclude the customary responsibility of States to prosecute and punish individuals, via their criminal courts or military tribunals, for violations of the laws and customs of war. International and national law (the latter including transposition of international norms) served as a basis for domestic prosecutions and liability. In particular, where national law did not provide for the specific characteristics of a war crime, the domestic court could rely on international law as a basis for its reasoning, without infringing the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena sine lege [37]."

Turning to the practice of such domestic tribunals, the Court notes that, while many States prohibited war crimes in their domestic legal systems and military manuals prior to the First World War, very few prosecuted their own war criminals [38], although the US courts martial in the Philippines were a significant and informative exception [39] as was the occurrence of the “ Leipzig ” and Turkish trials after the First World War. Lastly, during the Second World War there was a signalled intent from the outset to ensure the prosecution of war criminals [40] and, parallel to international prosecutions, the principle of domestic prosecutions of war criminals was maintained [41]. Accordingly, as well as the important IMT prosecutions, domestic trials took place during the Second World War (notably in the USSR) [42] and immediately after the Second World War [43], all concerning alleged war crimes committed during that war, certain trials being notable for their comprehensive treatment of relevant principles of the laws and customs of war, particularly as regards the necessity of a fair trial of combatants and civilians suspected of war crimes."

The Court has noted the detailed and conflicting submissions of the parties and the third parties on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR in 1940 and, consequently, on whether the acts on 27 May 1944 had any nexus to an international armed conflict and could therefore be considered as war crimes. The Grand Chamber considers (as did the Chamber, at paragraph 112 of its judgment) that it is not its role to pronounce on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR and, in any event in the present case, it is not necessary to do so. While in 1944 a nexus with an international armed conflict was required to prosecute acts as war crimes, that did not mean that only armed forces personnel or nationals of a belligerent State could be so accused. The relevant nexus was a direct connection between the alleged crime and the international armed conflict so that the alleged crime had to be an act in furtherance of war objectives [44]. The domestic courts found that the operation on 27 May 1944 was mounted given the suspicion that certain villagers had cooperated with the German military administration so that it is evident that the impugned events had a direct connection to the USSR/German international armed conflict and were ostensibly carried out in furtherance of the Soviet war objectives."

The Court understands individual command responsibility to be a mode of criminal liability for dereliction of a superior ’ s duty to control, rather than one based on vicarious liability for the acts of others. The notion of criminal responsibility for the acts of subordinates is drawn from two long-established customary rules: a combatant, in the first place, must be commanded by a superior and, secondly, must obey the laws and customs of war ( see paragraph 200 above) [45]. Individual criminal responsibility for the actions of subordinates was retained in certain trials prior to the Second World War [46], in codifying instruments and State declarations during and immediately after that war [47], and it was retained in (national and international) trials of crimes committed during the Second World War [48].

The Court observes the declaration of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel [52] case where the obligations to notify the existence of a minefield in territorial waters and to warn approaching warships were based, not on the relevant Hague Convention of 1907 (VIII) which applied in time of war, but on “general and well-recognised principles”, the first of which was described as “elementary considerations of humanity” which were even more exacting in peace than in war. In its later Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion [53], the ICJ referred to the two “ cardinal principles contained in the texts constituting the fabric of humanitarian law”. The first, referred to above, was the principle of distinction which aimed at the “protection of the civilian population and objects” and the second was the “obligation to avoid unnecessary suffering to combatants” [54]. Relying expressly on the Martens Clause, the ICJ noted that the Hague and Geneva Conventions had become “intransgressible principles of international customary law” as early as the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg. This was because, according to the ICJ, a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict were fundamental to “the respect of the human person” and to “elementary considerations of humanity”. Those principles, including the Martens Clause, constituted legal norms against which conduct in the context of war was to be measured by courts [55]."

The Court notes, in the first place, that the domestic criminal courts relied mainly on provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) ( see paragraphs 60-62 above) to convict the applicant for the ill-treatment, wounding and killing of the villagers. It considers, having regard notably to Article 23 (c) of the Hague Regulations, that, even if the deceased villagers were considered combatants or civilians who had participated in hostilities, jus in bello in 1944 considered the circumstances of their murder and ill-treatment a war crime since those acts violated a fundamental rule of the laws and customs of war protecting an enemy rendered hors de combat. For this protection to apply, a person had to be wounded, disabled or unable for another reason to defend him/herself (including not carrying arms), a person was not required to have a particular legal status, and a formal surrender was not required [56]. As combatants, the villagers would also have been entitled to protection as prisoners of war under the control of the applicant and his unit and their subsequent ill-treatment and summary execution would have been contrary to the numerous rules and customs of war protecting prisoners of war (noted at paragraph 202 above). Accordingly, the ill-treatment, wounding and killing of the villagers constituted a war crime."

Secondly, the Court finds that the domestic courts reasonably relied on Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations to found a separate conviction as regards treacherous wounding and killing. The concepts of treachery and perfidy were closely linked at the relevant time so that the wounding or killing was considered treacherous if it was carried out while unlawfully inducing the enemy to believe they were not under threat of attack by, for example, making improper use of an enemy uniform. As noted at paragraphs 16 and 201 above, the applicant and his unit were indeed wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms during the operation in Mazie Bati. Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations clearly applies if the villagers are considered “combatants” and could also apply if they were considered “ civilians who had participated in hostilities ”. In this latter respect, the text of Article 23 (b) referred to killing or wounding treacherously “ individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army ”, which could have been interpreted as including any persons under some form of control of a hostile army including the civilian population of an occupied territory."

Thirdly, the Latvian courts relied on Article 16 of the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) to hold that burning a pregnant woman to death constituted a war crime in breach of the special protection afforded to women. That women, especially pregnant women, should be the object of special protection during war was part of the laws and customs of war as early as the Lieber Code 1863 (Articles 19 and 37). It was further developed through “Geneva law ” on prisoners of war (women were considered especially vulnerable in this situation) [57]. The Court considers these expressions of “special protection”, understood in conjunction with the protection of the Martens Clause ( see paragraphs 86-87 and 215 above), sufficient to find that there was a plausible legal basis for convicting the applicant of a separate war crime as regards the burning to death of Mrs Krupniks. The Court finds this view confirmed by the numerous specific and special protections for women included immediately after the Second World War in the Geneva Conventions (I), (II) and (IV) of 1949, notably in Article 16 of the last-mentioned Convention."

As the respondent Government remarked, in the applicant ’ s version of events to the Chamber ( see paragraphs 21-24 above) and repeated to the Grand Chamber ( see paragraph 162 above), the applicant in fact describes what he ought to have done (arrested the villagers for trial).

That court noted that that was sufficient to result in the command responsibility of the applicant for the acts of the unit, relying on Article 6 of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg. In particular, those established facts indicated that he was de jure and de facto in control of the unit. Given the purpose of the mission established domestically, he had the required mens rea.

                "124. As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court has again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 4 7 above). In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 126)."

Having regard to the manner in which the preventive detention order was implemented in the present case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s detention at the relevant time was executed in prison, in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. As found above (see paragraphs 9 5 -9 6 ), the Court, having regard to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 127) and to the material before it, is not convinced that the alterations to the applicant ’ s detention regime at the relevant time were such as to distinguish the execution of the preventive detention order against him from that of a prison sentence."

Germany (cited above, § § 128 -130 ), it could not subscribe to the Government ’ s argument that preventive detention served a purely preventive, and no punitive purpose, having regard to the realities of the situation of persons in preventive detention and, in particular, the lack of special measures for detainees in order to reduce the danger they present."

In the present case, the Court, referring to its findings above (see paragraphs 9 8 -9 9 ), notes that at the time of the applicant ’ s preventive detention as a result of the proceedings here at issue, extensive measures had been initiated in the defendant State on judicial, legislative and executive level with a view to adapting the execution of preventive detention to the requirements, in particular, of the fundamental right to liberty in the near future. As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders. However, the Court is not persuaded that during the period of the applicant ’ s detention here at issue, the applicant was provided with any such additional measures."

Germany (cited above, § 131), the applicant ’ s preventive detention was ordered by the sentencing courts. Its execution was determined by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences."

            [
                "129. Finally, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order – which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 118 ), is not in itself decisive – the Court refers to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and observes that that measure still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had any maximum duration. It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that the applicant to date has been in preventive detention approximately three times the length of the prison sentence imposed for his sexual offences."

In his reports, the expert, having regard to the common instruments for the classification of diseases ( inter alia, the ICD-10 and the psychopathy checklist), had considered the applicant as dangerous for being a psychopath and as suffering from paedophilia towards boys and from a dissocial personality, which could not be considered as pathological. His dissocial personality was characterised by continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour."

Despite the fact that the applicant had not used physical violence when committing his offences, there had been body contacts and sexual violence in that he had used children to satisfy his sexual desires.

That mental disorder did not have to diminish the applicant ’ s criminal responsibility. Psychiatric expert V. had explained in his additional report that the applicant suffered from paedophilia towards boys, which was a sexual deviation, and a dissocial personality.

As the applicant still considered the acts he had been convicted of to be punishable, but not harmful for the children concerned and claimed that any treatment was therefore unnecessary, it was almost certain that he would commit further similar offences if released.

Reversing its previous position, the Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions concerned, both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention, were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty."

The Federal Constitutional Court ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with the Basic Law remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until 31 May 2013 at the latest. In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, or ordered retrospectively under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 § 1 of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court ’ s case-law (see §§ 138 and 143-156 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment). If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released."

It stressed, in particular, that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in Article 7 of the Convention required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned. In line with the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 129), it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success (see § 113 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment)."

The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed its constant case-law that the absolute ban on the retrospective application of criminal law under Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law did not cover preventive detention. The latter was a measure of correction and prevention, which was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender (see §§ 100-101 and 141 ‑ 142 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment). The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., § § 102, 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of “ penalty ” to that under the Convention. Recourse should rather be had to the valuations ( Wertungen ) under the Convention in a result-oriented manner in order to prevent breaches of public international law (ibid., §§ 91 and 141 ss.)."

Specific disorders in a person ’ s personality, conduct, sexual preference and control of impulses were covered by the notion of “mental disorder” in section 1 § 1 of the Therapy Detention Act.

Detention or its prolongation under that Act could only be ordered if there was a difference between such detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment.

They had to establish, on the other hand, whether the applicant suffered from a mental disorder (see paragraph 4 4 above and, in contrast, the situation in Kallweit, cited above, § 56; O.H. v.

His dissocial personality was characterised by continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour (see paragraph 16 above)."

The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 of the Convention in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335 ‑ B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 32, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ).

At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 36 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most.

Germany, could no longer be considered as a “penalty” as a substantial difference was being established between the execution of a term of imprisonment and that of preventive detention."

                "121. In determining whether the applicant ’ s preventive detention, having regard to the criteria established in its case-law, constitutes a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1, it reiterates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence” (see paragraph 11 8 above). It notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant ’ s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant ’ s situation is thus comparable to that of the applicant in the M. v. Germany case (cited above, § 124) in this respect."

The Court would add that it was still that preventive detention ordered in 1997 which was being executed and prolonged by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences in the proceedings at issue. In particular, no use was made of the possibility provided for by the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraphs 39 -40 above) to obtain an order of a civil section of the competent Regional Court for the applicant ’ s placement in a suitable institution for mental health patients in view of his current dangerousness. Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence."

As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court has again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 4 7 above). In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 126)."

Having regard to the manner in which the preventive detention order was implemented in the present case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s detention at the relevant time was executed in prison, in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. As found above (see paragraphs 9 5 -9 6 ), the Court, having regard to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 127) and to the material before it, is not convinced that the alterations to the applicant ’ s detention regime at the relevant time were such as to distinguish the execution of the preventive detention order against him from that of a prison sentence."

As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders.

Finally, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order – which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 118 ), is not in itself decisive – the Court refers to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and observes that that measure still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had any maximum duration. It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code.

However, in any event, in the context of impeachment proceedings against the President of Lithuania for a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the presidential oath, the measures of removal from office and (consequent) disqualification from standing for election involve the head of State's constitutional liability, so that, by virtue of their purpose, they lie outside the “criminal” sphere.

It noted in that connection that J. B. , a Russian citizen by birth from a Soviet military family, had acquired Lithuanian citizenship under the Citizenship Act of 3 November 1989, by which citizenship could be granted, inter alia, to persons who on that date had had their permanent residence and permanent place of work or source of income in Lithuania. In 1994 the Constitutional Court had ruled that “soldiers of the Soviet Union who previously served in the Soviet occupying military forces unlawfully stationed in the territory of Lithuania [ could ] not be regarded as permanently residing and working in Lithuania ”. On 4 November 1999 the Citizenship Commission (established in 1998 under section 4 of the 1995 Implementing Act for the Citizenship Act) had found that J. B .'s status was unlawful, since he had served in the Soviet armed forces. It had nevertheless recommended that his status be regularised in accordance with the above - mentioned section 4, by which exceptions could be made for persons who had acquired citizenship in good faith before 31 December 1993 on that unlawful ground. On 11 November 1999 the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had followed that recommendation. However, in 2000 J. B. had applied for Russian citizenship, which he had been granted in June 2002; on 18 March 2003 he had been issued with a Russian passport, thereby losing his Lithuanian citizenship. The Constitutional Court observed that the applicant had signed Decree no. 40 on 11 April 2003 even though the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had reminded him the day before that J.

B. had acquired Russian citizenship in 2000. This showed that “citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania was of less value to [J.B.] than citizenship of the Russian Federation ”. The Constitutional Court further noted that the Director of the State Security Department had informed the applicant, prior to 11 April 2003, that an investigation was being carried out into J. B .'s activities as director of an aviation company and, on 17 March 2003, that J. B. had threatened to disseminate information discrediting the applicant if the latter failed to keep his promise to appoint him as an adviser. In the Constitutional Court's view, the applicant had knowingly ignored these circumstances, although they were of crucial importance in deciding whether or not to grant citizenship to J. B. by way of exception. Having regard also to the fact that J. B. had made a significant financial contribution to the applicant's election campaign, it concluded that the decision to grant him citizenship had been “ determined not by any merit rendering [J. B. ] worthy of becoming a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania, but by his significant assistance by financial and other means to [the applicant's ] election campaign in 2002 ”. Thus, “the granting of citizenship to [J. B. ] by way of exception was nothing but a reward by the President of the Republic R. Paksas to [J. B. ] for the aforesaid support ”; consequently, in issuing Decree no. 40, the President had heeded “ neither the Constitution ... nor the law, nor the interests of the people and the State, but purely his own interests ”. The court therefore concluded that the applicant had “ afforded [J. B. ] exceptional treatment and knowingly disregarded the fundamental principles enshrined in Article 29 § 1 and Article 82 § 1 of the Constitution respectively, whereby all persons are equal before State institutions or officials, and the President of the Republic must be equally just to all”."

Similarly, in Poland the special court with competence in such matters may, in addition to removing the President from office, temporarily deprive him or her of certain political rights ( general disqualification from standing for election for a period of up to ten years, prohibition from occupying certain positions for a similar period and revocation of orders and other honorary titles ). In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, a person removed from presidential office as a result of impeachment proceedings permanently forfeits the right to stand for election as President but may be a candidate in any other elections; in the Russian Federation he or she is barred only from standing in the presidential elections called as a result of his or her removal from office.",

The applicant alleged a violation of his right to a fair hearing in connection with the two sets of proceedings in the Constitutional Court, concerning Decree no. 40 and the merits of the impeachment charges against him. He submitted that because of collusion between the court's President and the member of the Seimas who had initiated the proceedings against him, the Constitutional Court could not be considered an independent and impartial tribunal, and noted that that court had subsequently issued a public response to his accusations of bias on its part; in a supplement to his application, dated 30 November 2006, he added that the Constitutional Court's endorsement of the conclusions of the declaration of 25 March 2004 by the Seimas showed that it had been put under considerable pressure by Parliament as a result of such collusion. He further submitted that he had been unable to defend himself effectively and that, in the impeachment proceedings, his lawyers had not had access to certain classified documents which the special investigation commission had examined and the Constitutional Court had exceeded its powers by making findings as to the facts and the issue of “guilt”. He relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 ( b) of the Convention, which provides :",

The Government further noted that, as President of Lithuania, the applicant could have applied to the Constitutional Court, under section 61 of the Constitutional Court Act, for an interpretation of its ruling of 11 May 1999, in which it had held that the constitutional sanction imposed in the context of impeachment proceedings was “ of an irreversible nature ”, and asked it to clarify whether this meant lifelong disqualification from standing for election.

He added that an application to the Constitutional Court under section 61 of the Constitutional Court Act for an interpretation of the ruling of 11 May 1999 would have been ineffective, seeing that the meaning of the phrase “of an irreversible nature” was not open to doubt.

Thus, the complaint to be submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. Nevertheless, the only remedies that must be exhausted are those that are effective and capable of redressing the alleged violation ( see, among many other authorities, Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports 1996 ‑ II ). More specifically, the only remedies which Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient; the existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness ( see, for example, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 75, ECHR 1999-V).

It follows from Article 107 of the Lithuanian Constitution that decisions of the Constitutional Court have statutory force and are final. Furthermore, as the Government pointed out in their written observations, the Constitutional Court itself is bound by its own precedents. An appeal against a refusal to register the applicant as a candidate for election to the Seimas would therefore have been bound to fail. Indeed, the Supreme Administrative Court's decision of 28 May 2004 provides an illustration of this point, since it attached decisive weight to the Constitutional Court's conclusions of 25 May 2004 in dismissing the applicant's complaint against the refusal of the Central Electoral Committee to register him as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election."

Such a request could not, however, have prompted an examination of the applicant's particular situation for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.

He is therefore complaining of provisions giving rise to a continuing state of affairs, against which no domestic remedy is in fact available to him. However, as the European Commission of Human Rights noted in the De Becker v. Belgium decision (9 June 1958, no. 214/56, Yearbook 2), the existence of the six-month period specified in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question. Although this represents a “legitimate concern for order, stability and peace”, it cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the consideration of a permanent state of affairs which is not a thing of the past but still continues without any domestic remedy being available to the applicant; since there is no justification for the application of the rule, there can be no question of his being debarred by lapse of time. The Commission added that accordingly, “when [it] receives an application concerning a legal provision which gives rise to a permanent state of affairs for which there is no domestic remedy, the problem of the six months period specified in Article 26 [ of the Convention ( current Article 35 § 1)] can arise only after this state of affairs has ceased to exist; ... in the circumstances, it is exactly as though the alleged violation was being repeated daily, thus preventing the running of the six months period”. The Court itself has subsequently applied this principle. Thus, it has considered the merits of a number of applications which concerned statutory provisions that had not given rise to individual decisions against the applicants but had produced a permanent state of affairs, and which had been lodged more than six months after the entry into force of the provisions in question ( see, for example, Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005-IX, and Sejdić and Finci v.

It based that conclusion on the observation that the main content and general tenor of the applicant's book, and thus its aim, were markedly revisionist and therefore ran counter to the fundamental values of the Convention and of democracy, namely justice and peace, and inferred from that observation that he had attempted to deflect Article 10 from its real purpose by using his right to freedom of expression for ends which were contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention ( see also Witzsch v. Germany (dec.), no. 4785/03, 13 December 2005 ). The Court reached the same conclusion in, for example, Norwood ( (dec.), cited above ) and Pavel Ivanov v.

France (no. 20985/05, § 35, 15 January 2005 ) it noted that statements pursuing the unequivocal aim of justifying war crimes such as torture or summary executions likewise amounted to deflecting Article 10 from its real purpose. In the same vein, the Court has held that Article 17 of the Convention prevented the founders of an association whose memorandum of association had anti-Semitic connotations from relying on the right to freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention to challenge its prohibition, noting in particular that the applicants were essentially seeking to employ that Article as a basis under the Convention for a right to engage in activities contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention ( see W.P. and Others, cited above )."

The Government pointed out that rulings of the Constitutional Court were final and binding on everyone, including the court itself, and that, like the actual text of the Constitution, “implicit” constitutional provisions could be amended only by changing the Constitution. They also emphasised that the conclusions reached by the Constitutional Court in the present case had not been unforeseeable, in particular given that, in a ruling of 11 March 1999 ( see paragraph 50 above ), that court had stressed that the constitutional sanction resulting from removal from office was irreversible; its ruling of 25 May 2004 had thus been consistent with its previous case-law."

                "92. The Government further noted that the restriction in question, which applied only to the passive aspect of the right protected by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, was not directed at the applicant personally but at a category of individuals to which he indisputably belonged.",
                "They added that the purpose of the restriction was to prevent persons who had committed a gross violation of the Constitution or breached the constitutional oath from holding an office for which it was necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution; it therefore pursued the legitimate aim not only of preserving the democratic order but also of “protecting national security”.",
                "In the Government's submission, taking into account what was at stake, the restriction could not be regarded as disproportionate. In that connection they emphasised that such conduct on the part of the highest authorities – especially the head of State – undermined people's trust in State institutions and posed a serious and imminent threat to democracy and the constitutional order. Furthermore, relying on Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC] (no. 58278/00, §§ 100 and 103, ECHR 2006-IV), they highlighted the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in this sphere and also, referring to the concept of a “ democracy capable of defending itself”, the need to take account of the evolution of the political context in which the measure in issue had been taken; features unacceptable in the context of one country's system could be justified in another system. On that point, they stressed that Lithuania had been a democracy only between 1918 and 1940 and after 1990; accordingly, it did not have a long -standing democratic tradition, society had not completely rid itself of the “remnants of the totalitarian occupying regime” – including corruption and a lack of public trust in State institutions – and there were numerous examples of inappropriate and unethical conduct in politics. Lithuania's political, historical, cultural and constitutional situation therefore justified the measure in question, even though it might appear excessive in a well-established democracy. That position was all the more compelling in this instance since the head of State was the institution to which the nation had entrusted the duties of protecting and defending the constitutional order and democracy. Lastly, the lack of a European consensus in this area served to confirm that in deciding that persons dismissed following impeachment proceedings should be permanently disqualified from elected office, Lithuania remained within its margin of appreciation."

In addition, relying on Ždanoka ( cited above, §§ 112-14), the Government emphasised that the categories of persons affected by the prohibition imposed on the applicant were clearly and precisely defined and that the applicable rules afforded the highest possible degree of individualisation and guarantees against arbitrariness. They noted in that connection that two institutions were involved in impeachment proceedings, namely the Seimas and the Constitutional Court; only the former could initiate them, and only the latter could rule on whether there had been a violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath. Only if the Constitutional Court had established such a violation could the Seimas remove the person concerned from office ( and, moreover, this required a three-fifths majority of all members of the Seimas ). They also pointed out that impeachment proceedings were judicial in nature, that the rules of criminal procedure applied, that in such proceedings the Seimas was presided over not by one of its members but by a member of the Supreme Court, and that the decision included reasons and was taken following an objective public investigation into the circumstances of the case. In the instant case, moreover, the applicant had had the opportunity to escape “full” constitutional liability by resigning after the Constitutional Court's opinion of 31 March 2004; he would thereby have avoided being removed from office and the resulting disqualification from standing for election."

This was particularly true in his case since, although the charges forming the basis for his removal from office were criminal in nature, they had either not given rise to a criminal prosecution after his immunity had been lifted or they had resulted in his acquittal. He was therefore subject to a permanent sanction based on a questionable decision by a court that appeared biased, on account of acts constituting criminal offences in respect of which he had either been acquitted or not prosecuted."

                "He further contended that the restriction of his right under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was disproportionate in that it was not subject to a time-limit. Noting in that connection that in the Ždanoka case the Chamber (judgment of 17 June 2004) had found a violation of that Article for that reason, he argued that since the authoritative nature of the Constitutional Court's rulings meant that his disqualification was permanent, a finding along similar lines was all the more compelling in his case. Although he nonetheless conceded that the European Commission of Human Rights had reached the opposite conclusion in several cases, he pointed out that all those cases had concerned persons found guilty of particularly serious offences such as war crimes or acts of high treason, whereas he had not been convicted of any criminal offence on account of the acts forming the basis of his disqualification from standing for election.",

Belgium ( 2 March 1987, §§ 46-54, Series A no. 113 ); Hirst ( cited above, §§ 56-62 ), Ždanoka ( cited above, §§ 102- 15); Ādamsons v. Latvia (no. 3669/03, § 111, ECHR 2008-.. .); and Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, §§ 154-162, ECHR 2010-. .. ).",
                "It follows from the foregoing that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which enshrines a fundamental principle of an effective political democracy and is accordingly of prime importance in the Convention system, implies the subjective rights to vote and to stand for election ( see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, §§ 47-51; Hirst, cited above, §§ 57-58; Ždanoka, cited above, §§ 102- 03; and Tănase, cited above, § § 154-55 ).",
                "Although those rights are important, they are not absolute. There is room for “implied limitations”, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere ( see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52; Hirst, cited above, § 60; and Ždanoka, cited above, § 103). The margin in this area is wide, seeing that there are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision ( see Hirst, cited above, § 61, and Ždanoka, loc. cit. ).",
                "Thus, for the purposes of applying Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, any electoral legislation or electoral system must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned; features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may accordingly be justified in the context of another, at least so long as the chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the “free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” ( see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54; Ždanoka, cited above, § § 106 and 115; and Tănase, cited above, § 157 ).",

It has to satisfy itself that the restrictions imposed do not curtail the right in question to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness; that they pursue a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate. In particular, such restrictions must not thwart “ the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature ” ( see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52; Hirst, cited above, § 62; Ždanoka, cited above, § 104; and Tănase, cited above, §§ 157 and 161 ).",

It reiterates, however, that under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 it is only required to examine the applicant's inability to stand for election to the Seimas. In any event, in so far as the rule in question entails ineligibility for parliamentary office, it was not applied retrospectively in the applicant's case. In fact, the first parliamentary elections in which he was barred from standing were held in October 2004, long after the above-mentioned ruling and legislative enactment."

                "The Court accepts that this is the position in the present case. The prohibition imposed on the applicant is the consequence of his removal from office following impeachment proceedings, the purpose of which, according to the Statute of the Seimas, is to determine the constitutional liability of the highest- ranking State officials for acts carried out while in office which undermine the authorities'credibility. The measure thus forms part, according to the reasons given in the Constitutional Court's ruling of 24 May 2004, of a self-protection mechanism for democracy through “ public and democratic scrutiny ” of those holding public office, and pursues the aim of excluding from the legislature any senior officials who, in particular, have committed gross violations of the Constitution or breached their constitutional oath. As the Government submitted, the measure is thus intended to preserve the democratic order, which constitutes a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 ( see, for example, Ždanoka, cited above, § 118)."

In assessing the proportionality of the interference, it should above all be emphasised that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not exclude the possibility of imposing restrictions on the electoral rights of a person who has, for example, seriously abused a public position or whose conduct has threatened to undermine the rule of law or democratic foundations ( see, for example, Ždanoka, cited above, § 110). The present case concerns circumstances of this kind. In the context of impeachment proceedings, the Constitutional Court held that by having, while in office as President, unlawfully and for his own personal ends granted Lithuanian citizenship to J.B., disclosed a State secret to the latter by informing him that he was under investigation by the secret services, and exploited his own status to exert undue influence on a private company for the benefit of close acquaintances, the applicant had committed a gross violation of the Constitution and breached his constitutional oath. On the basis of that finding, the Seimas removed the applicant from office, his inability to serve as a member of parliament being a consequence of that decision."

Furthermore, as the Court observed above, the categories of persons affected by the disqualification are very clearly defined in law, and as a former President removed from office following impeachment proceedings for a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath, there is no doubt whatsoever that the applicant belongs to that group. Indeed, that has never been in dispute. There is therefore a clear link between the applicant's disqualification from elected office and his conduct and situation. As a result, the fact that his disqualification was not based on a specific court decision following a review of its proportionality in the individual circumstances of his case is not decisive ( see, for example, Hirst, cited above, § 71; Ždanoka, cited above, §§ 113 ‑ 14, 115 ( d) and 128; and Ādamsons, cited above, §§ 124-25 ), especially since the finding that he had committed a violation of the Constitution and breached his constitutional oath was made by the Constitutional Court, which offers the guarantees of a judicial body.",
                "More broadly, the Court observes that in the context of impeachment proceedings, following which a senior State official may be removed from office and barred from standing for election, domestic law provides for a number of safeguards protecting the persons concerned from arbitrary treatment. Firstly, it appears from the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Statute of the Seimas that the rules of criminal procedure and fair- trial principles apply in impeachment proceedings (see paragraphs 46 and 50 above). In addition, while the decision to initiate such proceedings on account of a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath and the final decision to remove a senior official from office are the prerogative of a political body, namely the Seimas, it is the task of a judicial body, namely the Constitutional Court, to rule on whether there has been a violation of the Constitution; if the court finds no such violation, the Seimas cannot remove the official from office. Furthermore, when sitting in impeachment proceedings the Seimas is presided over not by one of its members but by a judge of the Supreme Court, and it cannot remove a person from office other than by a three-fifths majority of its members in a reasoned decision. Lastly, in the specific circumstances of the present case the Court observes that the applicant, assisted by counsel, gave evidence to the Seimas and the Constitutional Court at public hearings."

This appears all the more severe since removal from office has the effect of barring the applicant not only from being a member of parliament but also from holding any other office for which it is necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution ( see paragraph 34 above )."

Admittedly, the Government contended that in assessing proportionality in the present case, regard should be had to the evolution of the local political context in which the principle of disqualification from elected office was applied. The Court does not disagree. It takes note in this connection of the Government's argument that, in a recent democracy such as (according to the Government) Lithuania, it is not unreasonable that the State should consider it necessary to reinforce the scrutiny carried out by the electorate through strict legal principles, such as the one in issue here, namely permanent and irreversible disqualification from standing in parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, the decision to bar a senior official who has proved unfit for office from ever being a member of parliament in future is above all a matter for voters, who have the opportunity to choose at the polls whether to renew their trust in the person concerned. Indeed, this is apparent from the wording of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which refers to “ the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.",

An “ institution ” in himself and the “personification” of the State, the President carries the burden of being expected to set an example, and his place in the Lithuanian institutional system is far from merely symbolic. In particular, he enjoys significant prerogatives in the legislative process since he has the right to initiate legislation (Article 68 of the Constitution) and the possibility, when a law is submitted to him for signature and promulgation, of sending it back to the Seimas for reconsideration ( Article 71 of the Constitution ). In the Court's view, it is understandable that a State should consider a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath to be a particularly serious matter requiring firm action when committed by a person holding that office."

In the other States in this category, there is either no direct effect on the exercise of the right to stand in parliamentary elections, or the permissible restrictions require a specific judicial decision and are subject to a time-limit ( see paragraph 6 2 above )."

The central issue in that case was a statutory provision barring persons who, like the applicant, had “actively participated after 13 January 1991 ” in the Communist Party of Latvia ( CPL ) from standing in parliamentary elections. The provision had been enacted by Parliament on account of the fact that, shortly after the Declaration of Independence of 4 May 1990, the party in question had been involved in organising and conducting attempted coups in January and August 1991 against the newly formed democratic regime. After observing in particular that, in the historical and political context in which the impugned measure had been taken, it had been reasonable for the legislature to presume that the leading figures of the CPL held an anti-democratic stance, the Court concluded that there had been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It held in particular that while such a measure could not be accepted in the context, for example, of a country with a long- established framework of democratic institutions, it might be considered acceptable in Latvia in view of the historical and political context which had led to its adoption, and given the threat to the new democratic order posed by the resurgence of ideas which, if allowed to gain ground, might appear capable of restoring a totalitarian regime ( see Ždanoka, cited above, § § 132-36; see also Ādamsons, cited above, § 113 ). However, besides the obvious contextual differences between that case and the present one, the Court, without wishing to underplay the seriousness of the applicant's alleged conduct in relation to his constitutional obligations, observes that the importance of his disqualification for the preservation of the democratic order in Lithuania is not comparable."

It further concluded that the Latvian Parliament should keep the restriction under constant review, with a view to bringing it to an early end, and added that such a conclusion was all the more justified in view of the greater stability which Latvia now enjoyed, inter alia by reason of its full European integration, indicating that any failure by the Latvian legislature to take active steps to that end might result in a different finding by the Court ( see Ždanoka, loc.cit. )."

The need for such a possibility is, moreover, linked to the fact that, as the Government noted, the assessment of this issue must have regard to the historical and political context in the State concerned; since this context will undoubtedly evolve, not least in terms of the perceptions which voters may have of the circumstances that led to the introduction of such a general restriction, the initial justification for the restriction may subside with the passing of time."

When the Seimas decided to remove the applicant from office as President (on 6 April 2004), no legal provision stated that he was to be barred from standing for election as a result. Accordingly, when he informed the Central Electoral Committee of his intention to stand in the presidential election called for 13 June 2004 following his removal from office, the committee initially found (on 22 April 2004) that there was nothing to prevent him from doing so. The Seimas then introduced an amendment to the Presidential Elections Act to the effect that anyone who had been removed from office following impeachment proceedings could not be elected President until a period of five years had elapsed, as a result of which the committee ultimately refused to register the applicant as a candidate. Further to an action brought by members of the Seimas, the Constitutional Court held (on 25 May 2004) that such disqualification was compatible with the Constitution but that subjecting it to a time-limit was unconstitutional, adding that it applied to any office for which it was necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution. The Seimas subsequently (on 15 July 2004) introduced an amendment to the Seimas Elections Act to the effect that anyone who had been removed from office following impeachment proceedings was ineligible to be a member of parliament.",

However, Article 13 of the Convention, which does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State's laws as such to be challenged before a national authority on the ground of being contrary to the Convention ( see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 85, Series A no. 98; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 113, ECHR 2002-VI; Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 137, ECHR 2005-X; and Tsonyo Tsonev v.

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, § 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 117, ECHR 2008 ). However, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a further deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40, and Eriksen, cited above, § 78 ). The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court ) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40; Eriksen, cited above, § 78; and Weeks, cited above, § 49)."

Unlike a penalty, preventive detention was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender.

As regards the temporal applicability of the provisions on preventive detention, it is to be noted that, according to the wording of the applicable provisions in some of the States concerned, they may be applied retrospectively. Thus, pursuant to Article 200 of the Italian Criminal Code, a decision on preventive measures is to be based on the law in force at the time of their execution, and pursuant to Article 2 § 3 of the Slovakian Criminal Code, these decisions are to be based on the law in force at the time of the decision ordering the security measure. Under Article 4 § 1 of the Danish Criminal Code, the question whether an offence is to be punished by preventive detention is decided by applying the law in force at the time of the judgment in the criminal proceedings. The San Marinese Criminal Code likewise does not prohibit the retrospective application of preventive measures. By contrast, retrospective application appears to be prohibited in respect of preventive detention measures pursuant to Articles 23 § 1 et seq. of both the Austrian and the Liechtenstein Criminal Codes and under Swiss law."

In many other Convention States, there is no system of preventive detention and offenders ’ dangerousness is taken into account both in the determination and in the execution of their sentence. On the one hand, prison sentences are increased in the light of offenders ’ dangerousness, notably in cases of recidivism. In this respect it is to be noted that, unlike the courts in the majority of the Convention States, the sentencing courts in the United Kingdom expressly distinguish between the punitive and the preventive part of a life sentence. The retributive or tariff period is fixed to reflect the punishment of the offender. Once the retributive part of the sentence has been served, a prisoner is considered as being in custody serving the preventive part of his sentence and may be released on probation if he poses no threat to society (see, inter alia, sections 269 and 277 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997). On the other hand, offenders ’ dangerousness generally has an influence both on their conditions of detention and on their chances of benefiting from a reduction of their sentence or from release on probation.",

As regards the distinction between penalties and preventive measures in the Convention States and the consequences drawn from the qualification of the sanction in question, it must be noted that the same type of measure may be qualified as an additional penalty in one State and as a preventive measure in another.

Moreover, the Act of 25 February 2008 on post-sentence preventive detention and diminished criminal responsibility due to mental deficiency ( Loi relative à la rétention de sûreté et à la déclaration d ’ irresponsabilité pénale pour cause de trouble mental ) has introduced preventive detention into French law. Under Article 706-53-13 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, this measure may be ordered against particularly dangerous offenders who pose a high risk of recidivism because they suffer from a serious personality disorder. The French Constitutional Council, in its decision of 21 February 2008 (no. 2008-562 DC, Official Gazette ( Journal officiel ) of 26 February 2008, p. 3272), found that such preventive detention, which was not based on the guilt of the person convicted but was designed to prevent persons from reoffending, could not be qualified as a penalty (§ 9 of the decision). To that extent, it thus took the same view as the German Federal Constitutional Court in respect of preventive detention under German law (see paragraphs 31-33 above). Nevertheless, in view of its custodial nature, the time it may last, the fact that it is indefinitely renewable and the fact that it is ordered after conviction by a court, the French Constitutional Council considered that post-sentence preventive detention could not be ordered retrospectively against persons convicted of offences committed prior to the publication of the Act (§ 10 of the decision). In this respect, it came to a different conclusion than the German Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 31-33 and also paragraphs 3 4 -3 7 above).",

                "“203. During the visit, the Commissioner discussed the issue of secured custody with several Länder authorities, judges and medical experts. The Commissioner is aware of the public pressure judges and medical experts are exposed to when they make decisions regarding the release of a person who might recommit a serious crime. It is impossible to predict with full certainty whether a person will actually reoffend. Psychiatrists regularly assess the behaviour of an imprisoned person who might act differently outside the prison. In addition, it is difficult to foresee all the conditions that wait for the offender outside the prison.",
                "204. The Commissioner calls for an extremely considerate application of secured custody. Alternative measures should also be considered before recourse to secured custody is taken. The Commissioner is concerned about the rising number of people deprived of their liberty under secured custody. He encourages the German authorities to commission independent studies on the implementation of secured custody in order to evaluate the measure in terms of protecting the general public and its impact on the detained individual.",
                "20 6. Furthermore, the Commissioner was informed that persons kept under secured custody regularly experience a loss of future perspective and give up on themselves. This would appear to call for the provision of psychological or psychiatric care. The medical opinion may occasionally be divided on the efficacy of care provided to persons kept under secured custody, yet the possibility of their eventual rehabilitation and release should not be excluded. Accordingly, people held under secured custody should receive adequate medical treatment or other care that addresses their specific situation.”",

In its report to the German Government on its visit to Germany from 20 November to 2 December 2005 (CPT/ Inf (2007) 18 of 18 April 2007), the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( “the CPT ” ) made the following findings in respect of the “ Unit for Secure Placement ” ( Sicherungsverwahrung ) in Berlin- Tegel Prison :",
                "“ 94. Material conditions in the unit were of a good or even very good standard, with several particularly positive elements: well equipped single rooms with sanitary annexes; a light and reasonably spacious communal environment; a small kitchen with equipment for inmates to prepare hot drinks and light snacks, and an area where washing, drying and ironing could be done.",
                "95. In principle, inmates had access to the same activities as ordinary prisoners (in terms of work, education, etc.). In addition, in accordance with the relevant legislation, inmates benefited from a number of special privileges. In particular, cell doors remained open throughout the day, and inmates were granted additional entitlements for visits (two hours instead of one hour per month), outdoor exercise (four hours instead of one hour on non-working days), the supply of parcels (six rather than three per year) and pocket money (if there was no work). It is also noteworthy that all inmates had unrestricted access to the telephone.",
                "96. In theory, at least, the unit offered opportunities for a positive custodial living environment. However, not all inmates were capable of making the best of these opportunities, which was not surprising if one takes into account that, according to medical staff, most if not all of the inmates were suffering from multiple personality disorders. The vast majority of inmates were completely demotivated, with only two taking any outdoor exercise, three working full-time and one part-time. Twelve inmates were offered work, but were not willing to take part in it. Thus, the vast majority of inmates was idling away their time alone in their cells, occupying themselves with watching TV or playing video games.",
                "Even among those inmates who apparently assumed and coped with the responsibility for their daily lives on the unit, the sense was that the activities were strategies to pass time, without any real purpose. As might be expected, this appeared to be related to their indefinite Sicherungsverwahrung. Several inmates interviewed expressed a clear sense that they would never get out and one stated that the only thing he could do was prepare himself to die.",
                "97. According to the prison administration, staff worked according to special treatment criteria, the aim being the individual ’ s release from placement in Sicherungsverwahrung; the focus was to minimise the risk to the general public, as well as to deal with the physical and psychological effects of long-term custody. Yet, the delegation observed that in practice, staff (including the social worker) were conspicuous by their absence in this unit, thereby keeping staff-inmate contacts to a minimum.",
                "99. Even for the other inmates who were apparently coping better with their situation, the lack of staff engagement on the unit was not justifiable. Allowing inmates responsibility and a degree of independence does not imply that staff should leave them to their own devices. The duty of care cannot be ignored, particularly in relation to such a special group of inmates. The delegation gained the distinct impression that the staff themselves were not clear as to how to approach their work with these inmates. As well as empowering inmates to take charge of their lives in custody, there is a need for ongoing support to deal with indefinite detention, as well as to address the legacy of serious past histories of aberrant behaviour and apparent psychological problems. Psychological care and support appeared to be seriously inadequate; the CPT recommends that immediate steps be taken to remedy this shortcoming.",
                "100. The difficult question of how to implement in practice a humane and coherent policy regarding the treatment of persons placed in Sicherungsverwahrung needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency at the highest level. Working with this group of inmates is bound to be one of the hardest challenges facing prison staff.",
                "Due to the potentially indefinite stay for the small (but growing) number of inmates held under Sicherungsverwahrung, there needs to be a particularly clear vision of the objectives in this unit and of how those objectives can be realistically achieved. The approach requires a high level of care involving a team of multi-disciplinary staff, intensive work with inmates on an individual basis (via promptly-prepared individualised plans), within a coherent framework for progression towards release, which should be a real option. The system should also allow for the maintenance of family contacts, when appropriate.",
                "The CPT recommends that the German authorities institute an immediate review of the approach to Sicherungsverwahrung at Tegel Prison and, if appropriate, in other establishments in Germany accommodating persons subject to Sicherungsverwahrung, in the light of the above remarks. ”",

There was not a sufficient causal connection between his continued detention after the completion of ten years in detention and his conviction in 1986. When the Marburg Regional Court had ordered his preventive detention in 1986, such detention could last for ten years at the most under the applicable legal provisions. It could not be ruled out that the Marburg Regional Court might not have ordered his preventive detention if it had known that the measure could remain in force for more than ten years. His continued preventive detention after the completion of ten years in detention was therefore based solely on the change in the law in 1998 which had abolished the maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention, and no longer on his conviction in 1986. If there had been no change in the law he would have been released automatically in 2001, without the court responsible for the execution of sentences having jurisdiction to order an extension of his preventive detention. In view of the absolute time-limit on the first period of preventive detention fixed by law at the time of his conviction, the change in the law abolishing the maximum duration concerned the question whether preventive detention should be applicable and not just the arrangements for executing it, so that the causal link between his conviction and his preventive detention no longer existed after ten years of detention."

Unlike the Federal Constitutional Court, many scholars considered preventive detention and the abolition of its maximum duration of ten years if ordered for the first time to be unconstitutional. The maximum period for a first period of preventive detention had been fixed by law. When he committed his offence, he could not have foreseen that this maximum duration would be abolished with immediate effect at a time when he was already in preventive detention and that he might be held in preventive detention for a period exceeding ten years. His right to lawful detention could not be balanced against public safety concerns."

The applicant ’ s preventive detention after the completion of ten years of detention had occurred “after conviction”, as there was still a sufficient causal connection between his initial conviction and the deprivation of liberty. In its judgment of 17 November 1986, the Marburg Regional Court had convicted and sentenced the applicant to five years ’ imprisonment and had ordered his preventive detention without reference to any maximum duration. Under the provisions of the Criminal Code, it was for the Marburg Regional Court, giving sentence, to decide whether or not to order a measure of prevention, but for the Regional Court responsible for the execution of sentences to decide on the execution of that measure, in particular on the duration of a convicted person ’ s preventive detention. Thus, both the sentencing court and the court responsible for the execution of sentences had participated in the applicant ’ s “conviction by a competent court”. Under Article 2 § 6 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 48 above), it had always been open to the legislator to reintroduce preventive detention without a maximum duration with immediate effect. In view of this, the subsequent abolition of the maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention had not broken the causal link between the applicant ’ s initial conviction in 1986 and his continued preventive detention."

The Government further argued that the applicant ’ s continued preventive detention was “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” as stipulated by Article 5 § 1. The domestic courts had confirmed the compliance of the applicant ’ s further detention with national law. Contrary to the applicant ’ s submission, his preventive detention was not based exclusively on the change to Article 67d of the Criminal Code, but had been ordered by the Marburg Regional Court in April 2001 in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also satisfied the test of foreseeability. The maximum duration of a period of preventive detention did not have to be foreseeable at the time of the offence as the dangerousness of an offender did not necessarily cease after a fixed period of time. Nor could the applicant have legitimately expected that the maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention would not be abolished, not least because priority over that expectation had to be given to the protection of society. According to Article 2 § 6 of the Criminal Code, decisions concerning measures of correction and prevention were to be taken on the basis of the provisions in force at the time of the decision (of both the sentencing court and the courts responsible for the execution of sentences), and not on the basis of those applicable at the time of commission of the offence. Therefore, it had been clear that the legislator could authorise the courts at any time to order preventive detention for an indefinite period of time. Moreover, there had been numerous requests to re ‑ abolish the maximum period for a first period of preventive detention, which had been introduced only in 1975."

However, the applicability of one ground does not necessarily preclude that of another; a deprivation of liberty may, depending on the circumstances, be justified under one or more sub-paragraphs (see, among other authorities, Eriksen v.

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, § 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.

However, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a further deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40, and Eriksen, cited above, § 78 ). The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court ) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40; Eriksen, cited above, § 78; and Weeks, cited above, § 49)."

However, that ground of detention is not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime. It does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see Guzzardi, cited above, § 102; compare also Eriksen, cited above, § 86). This can be seen both from the use of the singular (“an offence”) and from the object of Article 5, namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see Guzzardi, cited above, § 102 ).",

It is well established in the Court ’ s case-law under the sub ‑ paragraphs of Article 5 § 1 that any deprivation of liberty must, in addition to falling within one of the exceptions set out in sub ‑ paragraphs (a)-(f), be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see, among many other authorities, Erkalo, cited above, § 52; Saadi, cited above, § 67; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 116 ). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford, cited above, § 63, and Kafkaris, cited above, § 116 ). “Quality of the law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III; Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 71, 11 October 2007; and Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 76, 9 July 2009 ). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 54, Reports 1998 ‑ VII, and Baranowski v.

It observes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was ordered by judgment of the Marburg Regional Court of 17 November 1986 (the sentencing court), which found him guilty of, inter alia, attempted murder (see paragraph 12 above).

The latter found him guilty of attempted murder and ordered his preventive detention, a penalty or other measure involving deprivation of liberty. It notes that in the Government ’ s view, preventive detention is not fixed with regard to an offender ’ s personal guilt, but with regard to the danger he presents to the public (see paragraph 11 3 below ). It considers that pursuant to Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code, an order of preventive detention is nevertheless always dependent on and ordered together with a court ’ s finding that the person concerned is guilty of an offence (see paragraphs 49-50 above). The applicant ’ s placement in preventive detention was thus initially covered by sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 § 1. The Court would add, however, that, contrary to the Government ’ s submission, the decisions of the courts responsible for the execution of sentences to retain the applicant in detention do not satisfy the requirement of “conviction” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (a) as they no longer involve a finding of guilt of an offence."

As Article 2 § 6 of the Criminal Code permitted the abolition of the maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had the power to authorise the applicant ’ s continued preventive detention beyond the ten-year period, following the change in the law in 1998.

However, the sentencing courts never fix the duration, by virtue of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code (Articles 66 and 67c-e of the Criminal Code; see paragraphs 49 et seq. above); as the Government themselves submitted, the sentencing courts have jurisdiction only to determine whether or not to order preventive detention as such in respect of an offender. The courts responsible for the execution of sentences are subsequently called upon to decide on the detailed arrangements for execution of the order, including the exact duration of the offender ’ s preventive detention. However, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences were competent only to fix the duration of the applicant ’ s preventive detention within the framework established by the order of the sentencing court, read in the light of the law applicable at the relevant time."

At that time a court order of that kind, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 52 above), meant that the applicant, against whom preventive detention was ordered for the first time, could be kept in preventive detention for a maximum period of ten years. Thus, had it not been for the amendment of Article 67d of the Criminal Code in 1998 (see paragraph 53 above), which was declared applicable also to preventive detention orders which had been made – as had the order against the applicant – prior to the entry into force of that amended provision (section 1a ( 3 ) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code; see paragraph 54 above ), the applicant would have been released when ten years of preventive detention had expired, irrespective of whether he was still considered dangerous to the public. Without that change in the law, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences would not have had jurisdiction to extend the duration of the applicant ’ s preventive detention. Therefore, the Court finds that there was not a sufficient causal connection between the applicant ’ s conviction by the sentencing court in 1986 and his continued deprivation of liberty beyond the period of ten years in preventive detention, which was made possible only by the subsequent change in the law in 1998."

Mr Kafkaris ’ continuing detention beyond the twenty ‑ year term was in conformity with the judgment of the sentencing court, which had passed a sentence of life imprisonment and had expressly stated that the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for the remainder of his life as provided by the Criminal Code, and not for a period of twenty years as set out in the Prison Regulations, subordinate legislation in force at the time (ibid., §§ 118-21). By contrast, the preventive detention of the applicant in the present case beyond the ten-year point was not ordered in the judgment of the sentencing court read in conjunction with the provisions of the Criminal Code applicable at the time of that judgment."

It notes in this connection that the domestic courts did not address that issue because they were not required to do so under the provisions of the German Basic Law. It considers that sub - paragraphs (b), (d) and (f) are clearly not relevant. Under sub - paragraph (c), second alternative, of Article 5 § 1, the detention of a person may be justified “when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”. In the present case the applicant ’ s continued detention was justified by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences with reference to the risk that the applicant could commit further serious offences – similar to those of which he had previously been convicted – if released (see paragraphs 18 and 23 above). These potential further offences are not, however, sufficiently concrete and specific, as required by the Court ’ s case-law (see, in particular, Guzzardi, cited above, § 102 ) as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims, and do not, therefore, fall within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c). This finding is confirmed by an interpretation of paragraph 1 (c) in the light of Article 5 as a whole. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 5, everyone detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of that Article must be brought promptly before a judge and tried within a reasonable time or be released pending trial. However, persons kept in preventive detention are not to be brought promptly before a judge and tried for potential future offences. The Court notes in this connection that criminological experience shows that there is often a risk of recidivism on the part of a repeatedly convicted offender, irrespective of whether or not he or she has been sentenced to preventive detention ( § 203 of the report of the Council of Europe ’ s Commissioner for Human Rights dated 11 July 2007; see paragraph 76 above)."

The Court has further considered whether the applicant could have been kept in preventive detention beyond September 2001 under sub ‑ paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1 as being a person “of unsound mind”. While it does not rule out the possibility that the preventive detention of certain offenders may meet the conditions of that ground for detention, it observes that, according to the decision of the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal in the instant case, the applicant no longer suffered from a serious mental disorder (see paragraph 22 above). In any event, the domestic courts did not base their decisions to further detain the applicant on the ground that he was of unsound mind.

It has serious doubts whether the applicant, at the relevant time, could have foreseen to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances that his offence could entail his preventive detention for an unlimited period of time. It doubts, in particular, whether he could have foreseen that the applicable legal provisions would be amended with immediate effect after he had committed his crime.

In the applicant ’ s submission, a heavier penalty had been imposed on him retrospectively, contrary to the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, by virtue of the order made for his continued preventive detention after he had been in preventive detention for ten years. Preventive detention constituted a “penalty” within the meaning of that Article. He claimed that the domestic courts ’ view that, since its introduction into German criminal law, preventive detention had not been considered as a “penalty” and could thus be applied retrospectively, should be given less weight in the light of the fact that preventive detention had been introduced by the Law of 24 November 1933 on dealing with dangerous habitual offenders and on measures of correction and prevention (“the Habitual Offenders Act ”), that is, during the Nazi regime. According to section 129 of the Execution of Sentences Act (see paragraph 64 above), the sanction in question, imposed following an offence and administered by the criminal courts, pursued exactly the same aims as the execution of a prison sentence (section 2 of the Execution of Sentences Act; see paragraph 63 above), namely both to protect the public from the detainee (prevention) and to help the latter to readjust to life outside prison (reintegration into society)."

Preventive detention was related to an offender ’ s guilt, not least because it could be imposed only following certain previous offences and could not be ordered against a person who had acted without criminal responsibility."

Persons held in preventive detention in ordinary prisons were granted some minor privileges compared to persons serving their sentence in the same prisons (sections 131-35 of the Execution of Sentences Act; see paragraphs 64-65 above), such as the right to wear their own clothes. However, even if put into practice, these privileges did not alter the fact that the execution of a preventive detention order did not differ significantly from that of a prison sentence. As a person in preventive detention, the applicant was in fact granted fewer relaxations of the conditions of his sentence than ordinary prisoners. Moreover, no special measures in addition to those taken for ordinary prisoners were taken for persons held in preventive detention to help them prepare for a responsible life outside prison. The applicant ’ s conditions in preventive detention in Schwalmstadt Prison did not differ from those he had encountered when serving the major part of his sentence there. He was working as he had already worked when serving his sentence and, apart from occasional short periods of leave under escort, no efforts were made to prepare him for life outside prison, nor was there any therapy available. If one looked at the realities of detainees ’ situation rather than the wording of the Criminal Code, there was therefore no substantial difference between the execution of prison sentences and of preventive detention orders."

Moreover, the severity of a measure of indefinite preventive detention, which was executed after and in addition to his prison sentence of only five years, was illustrated by the fact that it had led to the applicant being deprived of his liberty – on the basis of the order for his preventive detention alone – for approximately eighteen years already. He claimed that, as a result, he had been detained for a considerably longer period of time than the period generally served by convicted offenders who unlike him had actually killed someone and had been ordered to serve just a prison sentence, without an additional order for their preventive detention. Given that he had been detained for more than twenty-two years already following his conviction in 1986, the fact that there had been only two incidents, which had occurred many years previously in a high-security prison setting, proved that he had learned to control his emotions and that his continued imprisonment was not justified."

In the Government ’ s view, the applicant ’ s preventive detention for a period exceeding ten years did not violate the prohibition under Article 7 § 1 on increasing a penalty retrospectively, because preventive detention was not a “penalty” within the meaning of that provision. German criminal law had a twin-track system of sanctions which made a strict distinction between penalties and what were referred to as measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention. Penalties were of a punitive nature and were fixed with regard to the offender ’ s personal guilt. Measures of correction and prevention, on the other hand, were of a preventive nature and were ordered because of the danger presented by the offender, irrespective of his or her guilt. This twin-track system, introduced in 1933, had been evaluated and confirmed by the democratically elected legislature on several occasions since the end of the Second World War. Preventive detention was a measure of last resort aimed only at the prevention of dangers to the public emanating from the most dangerous offenders, as shown by the restrictive conditions laid down in the Criminal Code concerning preventive detention orders and the continuation of preventive detention (see paragraphs 47 and 49 -5 6 above), and their restrictive application by the domestic courts. Unlike a penalty, preventive detention could be suspended on probation at any time, provided that it could be expected that the detainee would no longer commit serious criminal offences outside prison. As confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment in the present case, preventive detention was therefore not a penalty to which the prohibition of retrospective punishment applied."

According to the Government, the execution of preventive detention orders differed significantly from the enforcement of prison sentences, as regards both the legislative provisions (see, in particular, sections 129-35 of the Execution of Sentences Act; paragraphs 64-65 above) and practice. It was true that there were no separate preventive detention facilities in the German Länder for economic reasons and in view of the range of treatment facilities required. Creating one central facility in Germany for all persons kept in preventive detention would render impossible visits by relatives or persons helping in the detainee ’ s social reintegration, both of which were desirable. Persons in preventive detention were therefore kept in separate wings of prisons. However, compared to ordinary prisoners, persons in preventive detention had a number of privileges : unlike the former, they had the right to wear their own clothes and to receive longer visits of at least two hours per month. They also had more pocket money and the right to receive more parcels than ordinary prisoners. Moreover, if they so wished, they could have an individual cell which was not locked during the day, which they could furnish and equip in a personal manner. As regards the applicant ’ s preventive detention in particular, the Government stressed that he no longer received any therapy as the psychologist he had consulted had considered his treatment to be completed. The applicant had almost daily discussions with the social worker and the psychologist in charge at his own initiative and participated in a discussion group which met every fortnight. In line with a psychiatric expert ’ s recommendation, the applicant was benefiting from measures to relax the conditions of his preventive detention, such as short periods of leave under escort (see paragraphs 43-44 above)."

The Government further argued that, according to the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Kafkaris ( cited above, §§ 151-52), subsequent changes which did not affect the penalty imposed in the initial judgment, but only the duration of the execution of that penalty, did not violate Article 7 § 1.

As shown by the penal statistics published by the Council of Europe (see paragraph 68 above), Germany had a low rate of enforced prison sentences as a result and its courts imposed short prison sentences compared to other Council of Europe member States. This proved that the twin-track system led to a restrictive and responsible sanctioning practice. However, the principle enshrined in the Basic Law that punishment should not exceed a person ’ s guilt prevented German criminal courts from imposing longer prison sentences instead of ordering preventive detention to serve the preventive aim of the protection of society.

France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above ). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands ( dec. ), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ).

Under the provisions of the German Criminal Code, preventive detention is qualified as a measure of correction and prevention. Such measures have always been understood as differing from penalties under the long-established twin-track system of sanctions in German criminal law. Unlike penalties, they are considered not to be aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but to be of a purely preventive nature aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender. This clear finding is, in the Court ’ s view, not called into question by the fact that preventive detention was first introduced into German criminal law, as the applicant pointed out, by the Habitual Offenders Act of 24 November 1933, that is, during the Nazi regime.

However, as reiterated above (paragraph 1 20 ), the concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope and it is thus for the Court to determine whether a particular measure should be qualified as a penalty, without being bound by the qualification of the measure under domestic law. It notes in this connection that the same type of measure may be and has been qualified as a penalty in one State and as a preventive measure to which the principle of nulla poena sine lege does not apply in another. Thus, the “placement at the Government ’ s disposal” of recidivists and habitual offenders in Belgium, for instance, which is in many ways similar to preventive detention under German law, has been considered as a penalty under Belgian law (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 19 ). The French Constitutional Council, for its part, found in its decision of 21 February 20 08 (no. 2008 ‑ 562 DC) that the preventive detention recently introduced into French law could not be qualified as a penalty, but could nevertheless not be ordered retrospectively, notably in view of its indefinite duration (see paragraph 75 above; see, for a further example, paragraph 74 above)."

            [
                "127. The Court shall therefore further examine the nature of the measure of preventive detention. It notes at the outset that, just like a prison sentence, preventive detention entails a deprivation of liberty. Moreover, having regard to the manner in which preventive detention orders are executed in practice in Germany, compared to ordinary prison sentences, it is striking that persons subject to preventive detention are detained in ordinary prisons, albeit in separate wings. Minor alterations to the detention regime compared to that of an ordinary prisoner serving his sentence, including privileges such as detainees ’ right to wear their own clothes and to further equip their more comfortable prison cells, cannot mask the fact that there is no substantial difference between the execution of a prison sentence and that of a preventive detention order. This is further illustrated by the fact that there are very few provisions in the Execution of Sentences Act dealing specifically with the execution of preventive detention orders and that, apart from these, the provisions on the execution of prison sentences apply mutatis mutandis (sections 129 to 135 of the said Act; see paragraphs 64-6 5 above)."

                "128. Furthermore, having regard to the realities of the situation of persons in preventive detention, the Court cannot subscribe to the Government ’ s argument (see paragraph 113 above ) that preventive detention served a purely preventive, and no punitive, purpose. It notes that, pursuant to Article 66 of the Criminal Code, preventive detention orders may be made only against persons who have repeatedly been found guilty of criminal offences of a certain gravity. It observes, in particular, that there appear to be no special measures, instruments or institutions in place, other than those available to ordinary long-term prisoners, directed at persons subject to preventive detention and aimed at reducing the danger they present and thus at limiting the duration of their detention to what is strictly necessary in order to prevent them from committing further offences."

            [
                "129. The Court agrees with the findings of both the Council of Europe ’ s Commissioner for Human Rights ( § 20 6 of his report; see paragraph 76 above) and the CPT (§ 100 of its report; see paragraph 77 above) that persons subject to preventive detention, in view of its potentially indefinite duration, are in particular need of psychological care and support. The achievement of the objective of crime prevention would require, as stated convincingly by the CPT (ibid.), “ a high level of care involving a team of multi-disciplinary staff, intensive work with inmates on an individual basis (via promptly-prepared individualised plans), within a coherent framework for progression towards release, which should be a real option ”. The Court considers that persons subject to preventive detention orders must be afforded such support and care as part of a genuine attempt to reduce the risk that they will reoffend, thus serving the purpose of crime prevention and making their release possible. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that “[w] orking with this group of inmates is bound to be one of the hardest challenges facing prison staff ” (§ 100 of the CPT ’ s report; see paragraph 77 above). However, in view of the indefinite duration of preventive detention, particular endeavours are necessary in order to support these detainees who, as a rule, will be unable to make progress towards release by their own efforts. It finds that there is currently an absence of additional and substantial measures – other than those available to all long-term ordinary prisoners serving their sentence for punitive purposes – to secure the prevention of offences by the persons concerned."

Moreover, pursuant to sections 2 and 129 of the Execution of Sentences Act, the execution of both penalties and measures of correction and prevention serves two aims, namely to protect the public and to help the detainee to become capable of leading a socially responsible life outside prison. Even though it could be said that penalties mainly serve punitive purposes whereas measures of correction and prevention are mainly aimed at prevention, it is nonetheless clear that the aims of these sanctions partly overlap. Furthermore, given its unlimited duration, preventive detention may well be understood as an additional punishment for an offence by the persons concerned and entails a clear deterrent element. In any event, as the Court has previously found, the aim of prevention can also be consistent with a punitive purpose and may be seen as a constituent element of the very notion of punishment (see Welch, cited above, § 30)."

As regards the procedures involved in the making and implementation of orders for preventive detention, the Court observes that preventive detention is ordered by the (criminal) sentencing courts.

                "132. Finally, as to the severity of preventive detention – which is not in itself decisive (see paragraph 120 above) – the Court observes that this measure entails detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer has any maximum duration. Moreover, the suspension of preventive detention on probation is subject to a court ’ s finding that there is no danger that the detainee will commit further (serious) offences (Article 67d of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 53 above), a condition which may be difficult to fulfil (see, to that effect, also the Commissioner for Human Rights ’ finding that it was “impossible to predict with full certainty whether a person will actually reoffend”; § 203 of his report, cited in paragraph 76 above). Therefore, the Court cannot but find that this measure appears to be among the most severe – if not the most severe – which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code. It notes in this connection that the applicant faced more far-reaching detriment as a result of his continued preventive detention – which to date has been more than three times the length of his prison sentence – than as a result of the prison sentence itself."

The Court further reiterates that it has drawn a distinction in its case-law between a measure that constitutes in substance a “penalty” – and to which the absolute ban on retrospective criminal laws applies – and a measure that concerns the “execution” or “enforcement” of the “penalty” (see paragraph 1 21 above). It therefore has to determine whether a measure which turned a detention of limited duration into a detention of unlimited duration constituted in substance an additional penalty, or merely concerned the execution or enforcement of the penalty applicable at the time of the offence of which the applicant was convicted."

They argued that the prolongation of that measure therefore merely concerned the execution of the penalty imposed on the applicant by the sentencing court. The Court is not convinced by that argument. As it has found above (see paragraphs 99-101 and 12 3 ), at the time the applicant committed his offence, the sentencing court ’ s order for his preventive detention, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force, meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for a maximum period of ten years. The prolongation of the applicant ’ s preventive detention by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences following the change in Article 67d of the Criminal Code therefore concerns not just the execution of the penalty ( preventive detention for up to ten years ) imposed on the applicant in accordance with the law applicable when he committed his offences.

It added that under Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 a prisoner who had served two days of his sentence was irrevocably considered to have served three days. The application of this rule gave the beneficiary an acquired right.

                "39. In judgment no. 197/2006 of 28 February 2006 the Supreme Court set a precedent known as the “Parot doctrine”. The case concerned a terrorist member of ETA (H. Parot) who had been convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973. The plenary Criminal Division of the Supreme Court ruled that the remissions of sentence granted to prisoners were henceforth to be applied to each of the sentences imposed and not to the maximum term of thirty years provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The court’s ruling was based in particular on a literal interpretation of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 according to which that maximum term of imprisonment was not to be treated as a new sentence distinct from those imposed, or a distinct sentence resulting from those imposed, but rather as the maximum term a convicted person should spend in prison. This reasoning made a distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena ); the former referred to the sentences imposed taken individually, to which remissions of sentence should be applied, while the latter referred to the maximum term of imprisonment to be served. The Supreme Court also used a teleological argument. The relevant parts of its reasoning read as follows:",
                "“... the joint interpretation of rules one and two of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 leads us to consider that the thirty-year limit does not become a new sentence, distinct from those successively imposed on the convict, or another sentence resulting from all the previous ones, but is the maximum term of imprisonment [ máximo de cumplimiento ] a prisoner should serve in prison. The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are: (a) first, a literal analysis of the relevant provisions leads us to conclude that the Criminal Code by no means considers the maximum term of thirty years to amount to a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply, for the simple reason that it says no such thing; (b) on the contrary, the sentence [ pena ] and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served [ condena ] are two different things; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the ‘term to be served’ [ condena ], and fixes the different lengths of that maximum ‘term to be served’ [ condena ] in relation to the ‘sentences’ imposed. According to the first rule, that maximum is arrived at in one of two ways: the different sentences are served in descending order of severity until one of the two limits set by the system is attained (three times the length of the heaviest sentence imposed or, in any event, no more than thirty years); (c) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the Code, since after having served the successive sentences as mentioned, the prisoner will no longer have to discharge [i.e. serve] the remaining ones [in the prescribed order] once the sentences already served reach the maximum length, which may not exceed thirty years ...; (e) and from a teleological point of view, it would not be rational for the combination of sentences to reduce a long string of convictions to a single new sentence of thirty years, with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence would be treated, without any justification, in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences, as in the present case. Indeed, there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing one murder is punished in the same way as committing two hundred murders; (f) were application for a pardon to be made, it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served [ condena ], but rather to one, several or all of the different sentences imposed; in such a case it is for the sentencing court to decide, and not the judicial body responsible for setting the limit (the last one), which shows that the sentences are not combined into one. Besides, the first rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 explains how, in such a case, the sentences must be served successively ‘the convicted person going on to serve the next sentence when the previous one has been extinguished by pardon’; (g) lastly, from a procedural point of view section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act clearly states that it is a matter of setting the maximum limit of the sentences imposed (in the plural, in keeping with the wording of the law), ‘ fixing the maximum term to be served in respect of all the sentences ’ (the wording is very clear).",
                "Which is why the term ‘combination [ refundición ] of the sentences to be served [ condenas ]’ is very misleading and inappropriate. There is no merging of sentences into a single sentence, but the number of years an individual can be expected to serve in respect of multiple sentences is limited by law. This means that the prisoner serves the different sentences, with their respective specificities and with all the corresponding entitlements. That being so, the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 may be applied to the sentences successively served by the prisoner.",
                "The total term to be served [ condena ] is thus served in the following manner: the prisoner begins by serving the heaviest sentences imposed. The relevant adjustments [ beneficios ] and remissions are applied to each of the sentences the prisoner serves. When the first [sentence] has been completed, the prisoner begins to serve the next one, and so on until the limits provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 have been reached, at which point all of the sentences comprised in the total term to be served [ condena ] will have been extinguished.",
                "Take, for example, the case of an individual given three prison sentences: thirty years, fifteen years and ten years. The second rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... limits the maximum term to be served to three times the most serious sentence or thirty years’ imprisonment. In this case the actual term to be served would be thirty years. The prisoner would begin serving the successive sentences (the total term to be served), starting with the longest sentence (thirty years in this case). If he were granted a ten-year remission for whatever reason, he would have served that sentence after twenty years’ imprisonment, and the sentence would be extinguished; next, the prisoner would start to serve the next longest sentence (fifteen years). With five years’ remission that sentence will have been served after ten years. 20 + 10 = 30. [The prisoner] would not have to serve any other sentence, any remaining sentences ceasing to have effect, as provided for in the applicable Criminal Code, once this maximum term, which may not exceed thirty years, is attained. ”"

In the above-mentioned judgment the Supreme Court considered that there was no well-established case-law on the specific question of the interpretation of Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 in conjunction with Article 70.2.

However, the Supreme Court departed from that interpretation, pointing out that that decision was an isolated one and could therefore not be relied on as a precedent in so far as it had never been applied in a consistent manner.",

This new “unit of punishment” was the term the prisoner had to serve, to which remission for work done in detention was to be applied. Remissions would therefore affect the sentences imposed, but only once the rules on the consecutive serving of sentences had been applied to them “for the purposes of their completion”. The dissenting judges also pointed out that for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, all Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court (agreements adopted by the plenary Criminal Division on 18 July 1996 and 12 February 1999), had agreed to the principle that reductions of sentence should be applied to the sentence resulting from the application of Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (the thirty-year limit). In application of that principle no fewer than sixteen people convicted of terrorism had recently had their sentences reduced for work done in detention although they had each been given prison sentences totalling over a hundred years."

This new interpretation to the convicted person’s detriment was based on a policy of full execution of sentences which was alien to the Criminal Code of 1973, could be a source of inequalities and was contrary to the settled case-law of the Supreme Court (judgments of 8 March 1994, 15 September 2005 and 14 October 2005).

It explained that remissions of sentence which had already been approved had to be taken into account by the trial court required to rule on the discharge ( liquidación ) of the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), and that remissions already accrued in application of the law could not subsequently be revoked to correct any errors or permit the application of a new interpretation. It added that where there was no appeal against a decision by a judge responsible for the execution of sentences, that decision became final and binding in conformity with the principle of legal certainty and the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled. It considered that the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not conditional under the relevant law, as demonstrated by the fact that prisoners who misbehaved or attempted to escape lost that right only in respect of future adjustments, not in respect of those already granted."

It considered that the new method of applying remissions of sentence as a result of the Supreme Court’s departure from its case-law in 2006 had challenged final judicial decisions concerning the interested parties. It noted that the Audiencia Nacional which had adopted the decisions in question had considered that the Criminal Code of 1973 (which provided for a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years) was more favourable to the persons concerned than the Criminal Code of 1995 (where the limit was twenty-five years) because they would have lost the right to remissions of sentence from the time the Criminal Code of 1995 entered into force had it been applied to them. Observing that the Audiencia Nacional had based its finding on the principle that the remissions of sentence provided for under the old Code should be deducted from the legal maximum term of imprisonment (namely thirty years), it held that final judicial decisions could not be altered by a new judicial decision applying another method. It concluded that there had been a violation of the right to effective judicial protection, and more specifically of the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled (the “intangibility” of final judicial decisions, or the principle of res judicata ). Concerning the right to liberty, it considered that, regard being had to the Criminal Code of 1973 and the method of applying remissions of sentence adopted in the judicial decisions cited above, the prisoners concerned had completed their sentences, which meant that their continued detention after the release date proposed by the prison authorities (in conformity with the formerly applicable rules) had no legal basis.

The Constitutional Court referred to the Court’s case-law establishing a distinction between measures constituting a “penalty” and those relating to the “execution” of a sentence for the purposes of Article 7 of the Convention ( Hogben v. the United Kingdom, no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 231; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Gurguchiani v.

                "52. In the parts of its judgment no. 39/2012 concerning the principle of legality, for example, the Constitutional Court stated:",
                "“3. ... It must first be observed that the question under examination does not fall within the scope of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution – namely the interpretation and application of criminal charges, the classification of the facts established in respect of the offences concerned and the application of the corresponding penalties ... – but rather concerns the execution of custodial sentences, that is to say the application of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, and the interpretation we are required to examine cannot lead to the serving of sentences heavier than those provided for in respect of the criminal offences concerned, or to imprisonment in excess of the legal limit. In a similar manner, contrary to what the prosecution have argued, the European Court of Human Rights also considers that, even when they have an impact on the right to liberty, measures concerning the execution of the sentence – rather than the sentence itself – do not fall within the scope of the principle of no punishment without law enshrined in Article 7 § 1 of the Convention provided that they do not result in the imposition of a penalty harsher than that provided for by law. In its judgment in the case of Grava v. Italy (§ 51) of 10 July 2003, the European Court of Human Rights reached this conclusion in a case concerning remission of sentence, citing mutatis mutandis Hogben v. the United Kingdom (no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 46, pp. 231, 242, relating to release on licence). More recently, in its judgment of 15 December 2009 in the case of Gurguchiani v. Spain (§ 31), the Court stated: ‘both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a ‘penalty’ and a measure that concerns the ‘execution’ or ‘enforcement’ of the ‘penalty’. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relate to a remission of sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the ‘penalty’ within the meaning of Article 7.’",
                "The court must also reject the complaint concerning the alleged violation of the principle of no punishment without law (Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution) as a result of the retroactive application of Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995 (in its initial wording and as amended by Organic Law no. 7/2003), authorising the sentencing judge or court to order that ‘decisions concerning adjustments of sentence, day-release permits, pre-release classification and the calculation of the time remaining to be served prior to release on licence should take into account all of the sentences imposed’ in certain situations where sentences were grouped together (Article 78 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The law obliges the courts to take into account all the sentences in cases where particularly heavy multiple sentences were imposed. There are certain exceptions to this obligation, however (Article 78 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code currently in force). That said, the impugned decisions and the Supreme Court decision cited in them did not involve any retroactive application of that rule (which in any event is not applicable to remissions of sentence for work done in detention, as the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with such remissions). They simply applied the provisions that were in force at the time the offences of which the applicant was convicted were committed (Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), but with a new interpretation which, although based on the method of calculation expressly provided for in Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995, was possible, they explained, in view of the wording of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. That being so, if one follows the reasoning of the judicial bodies and the applicable rules, the appellant’s complaint lacks any factual basis as the principle of the non-retroactive application of a harsher criminal law enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution is breached only where a criminal law has been applied retroactively to acts committed before its entry into force ...”",
                "Concerning the right to liberty, the Constitutional Court held:",
                "“4. ... In our case-law remissions of sentence for work done in detention directly affect the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution, as the duration of the term of imprisonment depends inter alia on how they are applied, regard being had to Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... That provision states that ‘the prisoner shall be entitled, with the approval of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, to one day’s remission for every two days worked’, as calculated periodically by the judges responsible for the execution of sentences, based on proposals made by the prison authorities, said remission then being taken into account, for the purposes of the term of imprisonment to be served, by the sentencing court ...",
                "We have also held that remissions of sentence for work done in detention are in the spirit of Article 25 § 2 of the Constitution and the rehabilitational purpose of custodial sentences ... While it is true that Article 25 § 2 embodies no fundamental right protected by the amparo remedy, it does establish a penal and prison policy guideline for the legislature, as well as a principle regarding the interpretation of the rules on the imposition and execution of prison sentences, and both the guideline and the principle are enshrined in the Constitution ...",
                "Also, having noted that the right guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution authorises deprivation of liberty only ‘in the cases and in the manner prescribed by law’, we have found that it cannot be ruled out that the manner in which the sentence to be served is calculated may undermine that right in the event of failure to comply with the legal provisions relating to the consecutive or concurrent serving of different sentences that might have given rise to a reduction of the duration of the detention, where failure to apply the rules concerned leads to the unlawful extension of the detention and, consequently, of the deprivation of liberty ... In a similar vein the European Court of Human Rights has also found a violation of the right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5 of the Convention in a case where a prisoner served a longer sentence ‘than the sentence [he] should have served under the domestic law, taking into account the remission to which he was entitled. The additional time spent in prison accordingly amounted to unlawful detention within the meaning of the Convention’ ( Grava v. Italy, ECHR, 10 July 2003, § 45).”",

                "“8. However, we cannot limit ourselves to the mere finding of a violation [of Article 24 § 1 of the Constitution] arrived at above. We must also consider the consequences of that violation in terms of the right to liberty (Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution).",
                "Bearing in mind the binding nature of the order of 28 May 1997 adopted by the court responsible for the execution of sentences (whose role it was to determine how the sentence should be served and when it should end) and the legal situation created by the aforesaid decision in respect of the calculation of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the sentence was served for years as prescribed in the order in question: application of the former Criminal Code and the rules governing remissions of sentence for work done in detention, according to which the prisoner was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days worked, and deduction of the resulting remission, as periods of sentence discharged, from the maximum actual term of thirty years to be served following the combination of the sentences. That was confirmed by unequivocal acts by the prison authorities, who drew up charts showing provisional lengths of sentence taking into account remission for work done in detention, approved periodically by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences further to proposals by the prison authorities, and in particular one chart of 25 January 2006 which served as a basis for the proposal to release the prisoner on 29 March 2006, submitted to the judge by the prison governor.",
                "It follows that, under the legislation in force at the time of the offence, and taking into account the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as calculated according to the firm and binding criteria established by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, the appellant had already discharged the sentence he was given. That being so, and although the appellant was deprived of his liberty in a lawful manner, his deprivation of liberty fell outside the cases provided for by law once he had finished serving his sentence in the conditions outlined above, as the legal basis for his continuing detention had ceased to exist. It follows that the additional time the appellant served in prison amounted to unlawful deprivation of liberty in breach of the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution (see Grava v. Italy, ECHR 10 July 2003, §§ 44 and 45).",

In the dissenting opinion she appended to judgment no. 40/2012, Judge A. Asua Batarrita stated that the fact that the new interpretation of the rule for calculating the term of imprisonment to be served had been applied while the sentence was already under way shed doubt on an established legal situation and distorted projections based on the consistent interpretation of the applicable rules. She described the arrangements for remissions of sentence introduced by the Criminal Code of 1973 and the distinction traditionally made between the “nominal duration” and the “actual duration” of the sentence, which the courts took into account when fixing sentences. She pointed out that remissions of sentence for work done in detention differed from other measures entailing adjustment of sentences, such as release on licence, and that the granting of such remissions was not left to the discretion of the courts, which were not bound by criteria such as the prisoner’s good conduct or how dangerous he or she was considered to be. The judge concluded that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were mandatory by law. She stated that, under the Criminal Code of 1973, the principle of legality should apply not only to offences but also to the punitive consequences of their commission, that is to say the nominal limit of the prison sentences and their actual limit after deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. Noting that the limits set under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the remissions of sentence for work done in detention, had effectively reduced the maximum nominal sentence (thirty years) to a shorter actual term of imprisonment (twenty years), except in the event of misconduct or attempted escape, she expressed the view that the “Parot doctrine” had established an artificial distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term of imprisonment to be served” ( condena ) that had no basis in the Criminal Code, and had subjected the application of the thirty-year limit to a new condition – not provided for by Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 – according to which, during that period, the sentence was to be served “in a prison”, thereby preventing the application of the rules on remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In her view that was tantamount to imposing a nominal maximum term of forty-five years (that is, thirty years’ actual imprisonment plus fifteen years corresponding to work done in detention).",

In view of all these considerations she concluded that the interpretation by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 2006 had not been foreseeable and that there had been a violation of Article 25 § 1 (principle of legality), Article 17 § 1 (right to liberty) and Article 24 § 1 (right to effective judicial protection) of the Constitution."

He specified that this requirement should apply to the real and effective duration of the deprivation of liberty. Having noted that the legislation interpreted by the Supreme Court – the Criminal Code of 1973 – was no longer in force in 2006 and could therefore be brought into play only if it worked in the convicted person’s favour, he concluded that a sudden, unforeseeable departure from the case-law was incompatible with the right to liberty.

It concluded that at the time when the offences had been committed and at the time when the decision to combine the sentences had been adopted (on 30 November 2000), the relevant Spanish law, taken as a whole, including the case-law, had been formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to discern to a reasonable degree the scope of the penalty imposed and the manner of its execution (see paragraph 55 of the Chamber judgment, with a reference, by contrast, to Kafkaris v.

As a result of this change of approach the thirty-year term fixed by the decision of 30 November 2000, of which she had been notified the same day, had ceased to be treated as a new, independent and/or final sentence and the various sentences imposed on her between 1988 and 2000 (totalling over 3,000 years’ imprisonment) in eight trials had, in a manner of speaking, been restored.

In the applicant’s submission the judgment concerned had resulted in the application to her case of the criminal policy behind the new Criminal Code of 1995, in spite of the fact that the intention of the drafters of the Code had been to keep the remissions of sentence provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973 in place for anyone who had been convicted under that Code."

In the applicant’s submission, the Criminal Code of 1973 was ambiguous in that it did not specify whether the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment was a new, independent sentence, whether the individual sentences continued to exist once they had been combined together, and to which sentence the remissions of sentence for work done should be applied. Judgment no. 197/2006 had not clarified the question of sentencing as the Supreme Court had not expressly set aside its order of 25 May 1990 according to which the combining of sentences provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 was the means of determining the sentence.",

The present case should be distinguished from cases concerning discretionary measures of early release or measures that did not result in a redefinition of the penalty (the applicant referred to Hogben, cited above, Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996; Grava, cited above; and Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005).

In any event, it was clear from Kafkaris that the “quality of law” requirement applied both to the scope of the penalty and to the manner of its execution, particularly when the substance and the execution of the penalty were closely linked."

They submitted that the different judgments convicting the applicant had been based on the Criminal Code of 1973, which had been in force at the times when the offences had been committed and which gave a very clear definition of the different offences and the penalties they entailed. Five of the judgments by which the applicant had been convicted, as well as the decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, had expressly informed the applicant that, in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code, the total duration of the prison sentence she would have to serve was thirty years. They also pointed out that on 15 February 2001, the date of the Audiencia Nacional ’s decision setting 27 June 2017 as the date on which the applicant would have finished serving her sentence, the applicant had already accrued over four years’ remission of sentence for work done in detention.

The sole purpose of combining and placing an upper limit on the sentences had been to fix the duration of the actual term to be served as a result of all the sentences imposed in the different sets of proceedings. Besides, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 made it just as clear that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were to be applied to the “sentence imposed”, in other words to each of the sentences imposed until the maximum term had been reached."

While it was true that prior to the adoption by the Supreme Court of judgment no. 197/2006 the Spanish prisons and courts had tended, in practice, to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention to the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment, that practice did not concern the determination of the penalty, but rather its execution. Furthermore, that practice had no basis in the case-law of the Supreme Court in the absence of any established principle as to the manner of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. The sole judgment delivered on this issue by the Supreme Court in 1994 did not suffice to set an authoritative precedent under Spanish law. The Supreme Court’s case-law in the matter had not been settled until its Criminal Division had adopted judgment no. 197/2006. What is more, the Government argued, that case-law had been endorsed by the full Constitutional Court in several judgments delivered on 29 March 2012, containing numerous references to the Court’s case-law concerning the distinction between a “penalty” and its “execution”."

Remissions of sentence continued to be applied, but to each of the sentences individually, until the maximum term had been reached. Only in the case of the most serious crimes, such as those committed by the applicant, would the thirty-year limit be reached before the remissions of sentence granted for work done in detention had significantly reduced the sentences imposed. Similarly, the Chamber had mistakenly considered that the Supreme Court had retroactively applied the policy behind the legislative reforms of 1995 and 2003. It was plain to see that the reforms in question made no mention of the means of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the Criminal Code of 1995 having done away with them.

In Kafkaris, the Court had acknowledged that a prison-law reform which was applied retroactively, excluding prisoners serving life sentences from earning remissions of sentence for work done in detention, concerned the execution of the sentence as opposed to the “penalty” imposed (§ 151). In the present case the Government submitted that there had been no change in prison law. The only effect of Supreme Court judgment no. 197/2006 concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention had been to prevent the date of the applicant’s release being brought forward nine years, not to increase the penalty imposed on her."

The disputed measure concerned remissions of sentence or “early release”, not the maximum term that could be served in respect of the sentences imposed, which had not changed. Remissions of sentence for work done in detention did not pursue the same aims as the penalty as such, but were measures relating to its execution in so far as they allowed prisoners to be released before all their sentences had been served, provided that they demonstrated a willingness to return to the social mainstream through work or other paid activities. That being so, remissions of sentence for work done in detention could not be likened to measures imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”; instead, they were measures relating to the prisoner’s conduct while serving the sentence. In any event there was no question of any “severity” as they always benefited the prisoner concerned by bringing forward the date of release."

As remissions of sentence for work done in detention were purely a prison matter, the Supreme Court could not be criticised for having departed from previous practice with regard to the application of remissions of sentence, as the change had had no effect on the rights enshrined in Article 7. The Court had never held that the foreseeability requirement extended to the exact length of the sentence to be served taking into account sentence adjustments, remissions, pardons or any other factors affecting the execution of the sentence.

It argued that where changes to the law or the interpretation of the law affected a sentence or remission of sentence in such a way as to seriously alter the sentence in a way that was not foreseeable at the time when it was initially imposed, to the detriment of the convicted person and his or her Convention rights, those changes, by their very nature, concerned the substance of the sentence and not the procedure or arrangements for executing it, and accordingly fell within the scope of the prohibition of retroactivity. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that certain legal provisions classified at domestic level as rules governing criminal procedure or the execution of sentences had serious, unforeseeable effects detrimental to individual rights, and were by nature comparable or equivalent to a criminal law or a penalty with retroactive effect.

The Court notes in this connection that, by a decision adopted on 30 November 2000 on the basis of section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act and Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, the Audiencia Nacional fixed the maximum term of imprisonment the applicant should serve in respect of all her prison sentences at thirty years (see paragraph 14 above). It further notes that, after having deducted from that thirty-year maximum term the remissions of sentence granted to the applicant for work done in detention, on 24 April 2008 the Murcia Prison authorities proposed 2 July 2008 to the Audiencia Nacional as the date for the applicant’s final release (see paragraph 16 above). On 19 May 2008 the Audiencia Nacional asked the prison authorities to change the proposed date and calculate a new date for the applicant’s release based on the new approach – the so-called “Parot doctrine” – adopted by the Supreme Court in judgment no. 197/2006 of 28 February 2006, according to which any applicable adjustments and remissions of sentence should be applied successively to each individual sentence until such time as the prisoner had finished serving the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment (see paragraphs 17, 18 and 39-42 above). Lastly, the Court observes that in application of this new case-law the Audiencia Nacional fixed the date of the applicant’s final release at 27 June 2017 (see paragraph 20 above).",

It is true that when the applicant committed the offences, Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 referred to a limit of thirty years’ imprisonment as the maximum term to be served ( condena ) in the event of multiple sentences (see paragraph 24 above). There thus seems to have been a distinction between the concept of the “term to be served” ( condena ) and the individual sentences ( penas ) actually pronounced or imposed in the various judgments convicting the applicant. At the same time, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973, on remission of sentence for work done, established that in discharging the “sentence imposed” the detainee was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days’ work done (see paragraph 24 above). However, that Article contained no specific guidance on how to apply remissions of sentence when multiple sentences were combined as provided for under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code and a maximum total term of imprisonment was fixed, as in the applicant’s case, where sentences totalling 3,000 years’ imprisonment were reduced to thirty years in application of that provision. The Court observes that it was not until Article 78 of the new Criminal Code of 1995 was introduced that the law expressly stated, with regard to the application of sentence adjustments, that in exceptional cases the total duration of the sentences imposed could be taken into account, rather than the maximum term provided for by law (see paragraph 32 above)."

It notes that, as the Government have acknowledged, prior to the Supreme Court’s judgment no. 197/2006, when a person was given several prison sentences and it was decided to combine them and fix a maximum term to be served, the prison authorities and the Spanish courts applied the remissions of sentence for work done in detention to the maximum term to be served under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The prison and judicial authorities thus took into account the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment when applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In a judgment of 8 March 1994 (its first ruling on this question – see paragraph 36 above), the Supreme Court referred to the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment as a “new, independent sentence” to which the possibilities of adjustment provided for by law, such as release on licence and remission of sentence, should be applied. The Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court, took the same approach when comparing the sentences to be served respectively under the Criminal Code of 1995 and the previous Code, taking into account any remissions of sentence already granted under the previous Code, in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law (see paragraphs 37, 41 and 48 above). Lastly, until the Supreme Court’s judgment no. 197/2006 this approach was applied to numerous prisoners convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973, whose remissions for work done in detention were deducted from the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 41 above)."

Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that in spite of the ambiguity of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973 and the fact that the Supreme Court did not set about clarifying them until 1994, it was clearly the practice of the Spanish prison and judicial authorities to treat the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), that is to say the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, as a new, independent sentence to which certain adjustments, such as remissions of sentence for work done in detention, should be applied."

That being so, while she was serving her prison sentence – and in particular after the Audiencia Nacional decided on 30 November 2000 to combine her sentences and fix a maximum term of imprisonment – the applicant had every reason to believe that the penalty imposed was the thirty-year maximum term, from which any remissions of sentence for work done in detention would be deducted. Indeed, in its last judgment convicting the applicant, on 8 May 2000, delivered before the decision to combine the sentences was taken, the Audiencia Nacional took into account the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the same Code, in determining which Criminal Code – the one in force at the material time or the Criminal Code of 1995 – was the more favourable to the applicant (see paragraph 11 above). In these circumstances, contrary to what the Government have suggested, the fact that the applicant did not challenge the decision of the Audiencia Nacional of 15 February 2001 fixing the date on which she would have finished serving her sentence ( liquidación de condena ) at 27 June 2017 is not decisive, as that decision did not take into account the remissions of sentence already earned and was therefore unrelated to the question of how remissions of sentence should be applied."

The Court further notes that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were expressly provided for by statutory law (Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), and not by regulations (compare Kafkaris, cited above). Moreover, it was in the same Code that the sentences were prescribed and the remissions of sentence were provided for. The Court also notes that such remissions of sentence gave rise to substantial reductions of the term to be served – up to a third of the total sentence – unlike release on licence, which simply provided for improved or more lenient conditions of execution of the sentence (see, for example, Hogben and Uttley, both cited above; see also the dissenting opinion of Judge A. Asua Batarrita appended to judgment no. 40/2012 of the Constitutional Court, paragraph 53 above). After deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention periodically approved by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( Juez de Vigilancia Penitenciaria ), the sentence was fully and finally discharged on the date of release approved by the sentencing court. Furthermore, unlike other measures that affected the execution of the sentence, the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not subject to the discretion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences: the latter’s task was to fix the remissions of sentence by simply applying the law, on the basis of proposals made by the prison authorities, without considering such criteria as how dangerous the prisoner was considered to be, or his or her prospects of reintegration (see paragraph 53 above; compare Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, §§ 98-99, ECHR 2012, and Macedo da Costa v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 26619/07, 5 June 2012). It should be noted in this connection that Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 provided for the automatic reduction of the term of imprisonment for work done in detention, except in two specific cases: when the prisoner escaped or attempted to escape, and when the prisoner misbehaved (which, according to Article 65 of the 1956 Prison Regulations, meant committing two or more serious or very serious breaches of discipline; see paragraph 26 above). Even in these two cases, remissions of sentence already allowed by the judge could not be taken away retroactively, as days of remission of sentence already granted were deemed to have been served and formed part of the prisoner’s legally acquired rights (see paragraphs 26 and 45 above). The present case should be distinguished in this respect from Kafkaris, where the five years’ remission of sentence granted to life prisoners at the beginning of their incarceration was conditional on their good conduct (see Kafkaris, cited above, §§ 16 and 65)."

The Court also considers it significant that, although the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with remissions of sentence for work done in detention for people convicted in the future, its transitional provisions authorised prisoners convicted under the old Criminal Code of 1973 – like the applicant – to continue to enjoy the benefits of the scheme if it was to their advantage (see paragraph 30 above). Law no. 7/2003, on the other hand, introduced harsher conditions of release on licence, even for prisoners convicted before its entry into force (see paragraph 34 above). The Court infers from this that in opting, as a transitional measure, to maintain the effects of the rules concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention and for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law, the Spanish legislature considered those rules to be part of substantive criminal law, that is to say of the provisions which affected the actual fixing of the sentence, not just its execution."

Relying on the “Parot doctrine” established in judgment no. 197/2006, given by the Supreme Court on 28 February 2006 – well after the offences had been committed, the sentences combined and a maximum term of imprisonment fixed – the Audiencia Nacional moved the date back to 27 June 2017 (see paragraph 20 above). The Court notes that in judgment no. 197/2006, the Supreme Court departed from the interpretation it had adopted in a previous judgment of 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The majority of the Supreme Court considered that the new rule by which remissions of sentence for work done in detention were to be applied to each of the individual sentences – rather than to the thirty-year maximum term as previously – was more in conformity with the actual wording of the provisions of the 1973 Criminal Code, which distinguished between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena )."

For example, in its decision applying the Supreme Court’s “Parot doctrine”, the Audiencia Nacional did not change the quantum of the remissions of sentence granted to the applicant for work done in detention. The decision did not concern whether she deserved the remissions, for example in view of her conduct or circumstances relating to the execution of her sentence.

That being so, it remains to be determined whether the new interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973, long after the offences were committed and the applicant convicted – and even after the decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – was reasonably foreseeable for the applicant, that is to say whether it could be considered to reflect a perceptible line of case-law development (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, § 43, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, § 41, both cited above). To establish that, the Court must examine whether the applicant could have foreseen at the time of her conviction, and also when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – if need be, after taking appropriate legal advice – that the penalty imposed might turn into thirty years of actual imprisonment, with no reduction for the remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973.",

The Court observes in this connection that the only relevant precedent cited in that judgment was a judgment of 8 March 1994 in which the Supreme Court had taken the opposite approach, namely that the maximum prison term of thirty years was a “new, independent sentence” to which all the remissions of sentence provided for by law were to be applied (see paragraph 36 above). In the Court’s view, the fact that a single judgment does not serve as an authority under Spanish law (see paragraph 40 above) cannot be decisive. What is more, as the dissenting judges observed in the judgment of 28 February 2006, an agreement adopted by the plenary Supreme Court on 18 July 1996 had established that remissions of sentence granted under the Criminal Code of 1973 were to be taken into account when comparing the sentences to be served under the new and the old Criminal Codes respectively (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above). Following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, the Spanish courts were required to use this criterion, on a case-by-case basis, to determine which Criminal Code was the more lenient, taking into account the effects on sentencing of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention."

In addition, as indicated above (see paragraph 102), the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code of 1995 were intended to maintain the effects of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention set in place by the Criminal Code of 1973 in respect of people convicted under that Code – like the applicant – precisely so as to comply with the rules prohibiting retroactive application of the more stringent criminal law.

That “law” – in the substantive sense in which the term is used in the Convention, which includes unwritten law or case-law – had been applied consistently by the prison and judicial authorities for many years, until the “Parot doctrine” set a new course.

In this connection, while the Court accepts that the States are free to determine their own criminal policy, for example by increasing the penalties applicable to criminal offences (see Achour, cited above, § 44), they must comply with the requirements of Article 7 in doing so ( Maktouf and Damjanović v.

Having regard to the French text, the word “conviction”, for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (a), has to be understood as signifying both a finding of guilt after it has been established in accordance with the law that there has been an offence (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, § 100, Series A no. 39), and the imposition of a penalty or other measure involving deprivation of liberty (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24 June 1982, § 35, Series A no. 50)."
            ],
            [
                "124. Furthermore, the word “after” in sub-paragraph (a) does not simply mean that the detention must follow the “conviction” in point of time: in addition, the “detention” must result from, “follow and depend upon” or occur “by virtue of” the “conviction”. In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the two (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Kafkaris, cited above, § 117; and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 88). However, with the passage of time the link between the initial conviction and the extension of the deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40). The causal link required under sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release, or to redetain a person, was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court, or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. Where that was the case a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (see Weeks, cited above, § 49, and Grosskopf v. Germany, no. 24478/03, § 44, 21 October 2010)."
            ],
            [
                "125. It is well established in the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 that all deprivation of liberty must not only be based on one of the exceptions listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) but must also be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 116, and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90). The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III; M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90; and Oshurko v. Ukraine, no. 33108/05, § 98, 8 September 2011). Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the domestic law define clearly the conditions for detention (see Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, § 120, 23 February 2012)."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that although Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention does not guarantee, in itself, a prisoner’s right to early release, be it conditional or final (see Kalan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 73561/01, 2 October 2001, and Çelikkaya v. Turkey (dec.), no. 34026/03, 1 June 2010), the situation may differ when the competent authorities, having no discretionary power, are obliged to apply such a measure to any individual who meets the conditions of entitlement laid down by law (see Grava, cited above, § 43; Pilla v. Italy, no. 64088/00, § 41, 2 March 2006; and Şahin Karataş v. Turkey, no. 16110/03, § 37, 17 June 2008).",

The Court observes first of all that as the applicant rightly pointed out, the distinction made for the purposes of Article 7 of the Convention between the “penalty” and the “execution” of the penalty is not decisive in connection with Article 5 § 1 (a). Measures relating to the execution of a sentence or to its adjustment can affect the right to liberty protected by Article 5 § 1, as the actual duration of deprivation of liberty depends on their application, among other things (see, for example, Grava, cited above, §§ 45 and 51, and, concerning the transfer of prisoners between States, Szabó v. Sweden (dec.), no. 28578/03, ECHR 2006-VIII). While Article 7 applies to the “penalty” as imposed by the sentencing court, Article 5 applies to the resulting detention."

In the present case the Court has no doubt that the applicant was convicted by a competent court in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention. Indeed, the applicant did not dispute that her detention was legal until 2 July 2008, the date initially proposed by the prison authorities for her final release. The Court must therefore establish whether the applicant’s continued detention after that date was “lawful” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

            [
                "129. The Court notes that in eight different sets of proceedings the Audiencia Nacional found the applicant guilty of various offences linked to terrorist attacks. In application of the Criminal Code in force at the time when the offences were committed, the applicant was given prison sentences totalling over 3,000 years (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In most of those judgments, as well as in its decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, the Audiencia Nacional indicated that the applicant was to serve a maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The Court notes that the applicant’s detention has not yet attained that maximum term. There is clearly a causal link between the applicant’s convictions and her continuing detention after 2 July 2008, which resulted respectively from the guilty verdicts and the maximum thirty-year term of imprisonment fixed on 30 November 2000 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris, § 120)."

                "130. However, the Court must examine whether the “law” authorising the applicant’s continuing detention beyond 2 July 2008 was sufficiently foreseeable in its application. Compliance with the foreseeability requirement must be examined with regard to the “law” in force at the time of the initial conviction and throughout the subsequent period of detention. In the light of the considerations that led it to find a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, the Court considers that at the time when the applicant was convicted, when she worked in detention and when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, she could not have foreseen to a reasonable degree that the method used to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention would change as a result of a departure from case-law by the Supreme Court in 2006, and that the new approach would be applied to her."

Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years ’ imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years ’ imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years ’ imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that “[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent [ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality”."

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court ’ s judgment, pointing out that the latter court ’ s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un - amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case was thirty years."

The possible meaning of the text of the legislation sets the outer limits, which cannot be overstepped by other methods of interpretation ...

Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009). In its judgment in the case of Gouarré Patte v. Andorra the Court extended the guarantees of Article 7 concerning the retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law to the possibility of retrospective revision of the final sentence if domestic law provided for such a possibility ( see Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, no. 33427/10, §§ 33 to 36, 12 January 2016).",

                "50. The Court observes that between 17 September 2004 and 16 June 2009 the applicant was convicted by three different judgments concerning different criminal offences. He was sentenced to prison terms of four years, thirty years and five months respectively (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). The second and the third judgment concerned offences committed before the applicant had started serving the term of imprisonment of four years imposed by the first judgment and the courts were therefore required under domestic law to determine one overall sentence for all three criminal offences (see paragraphs 13 and 22 above ). As they had not done so, the applicant, on 28 November 2011, applied to have an overall sentence determined under the provisions concerning the so - called irregular reopening of proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). On the basis of his application the court, on 13 January 2012, delivered a new judgment which modified the previously imposed sentences by determining one overall sentence of thirty years (see paragraph 13 above)."

They however maintained that the penalty had had sufficient legal basis and had not violated the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law (see paragraphs 41 to 44 above)."

The Court, referring to the principles set out in Del Río Prada (§§ 81-90, cited above ) and noting that the new judgment modified the scope of the “penalty” imposed previously by the trial courts (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above), finds that Article 7 of the Convention applies to the present case."

The Court further observes that at the time of the commission of the offence of murder, which carried a thirty - year prison sentence, the rules on the determination of an overall sentence set the maximum term at thirty years ’ imprisonment (see paragraphs 10 and 21 above ). However, the law under which the overall sentence was later determined in the applicant ’ s case, that is to say the 2008 Criminal Code, provided a maximum limit for the overall sentence of twenty years ’ imprisonment, save for the situation where two or more sentences of thirty years had been imposed (see paragraph 22 above). There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was entitled to the determination of the overall sentence under the 2008 Criminal Code, which had been in force when his last conviction had become final as well as when the judgment imposing the overall sentence had been given (see paragraphs 13, 22 and 25 above). The dispute in the present case rather relates to the question whether the 2008 Criminal Code could be interpreted as setting the maximum overall sentence for the applicant ’ s multiple offences at thirty years, instead of the explicitly provided limit of twenty years."

The Court notes that it has acknowledged in its case-law that no matter how clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances ( see Kafkaris, cited above, § 141)."

            [
                "55. The Court however notes that the present case does not concern such an inevitable element of judicial interpretation but a situation where the legal provision relied on by the courts provided a deficient legal basis for the determination of the sentence. In particular, the application of the wording of Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code to the applicant ’ s situation led to contradictory results. While, according to the terms of this provision, the applicant should not have had an overall sentence of more than twenty years imposed on him, the overall sentence should exceed each individual sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case included a term of imprisonment of thirty years (see paragraph 22 above). The Court notes that this deficiency resulted from the legislature ’ s failure to regulate an overall sentence for a situation such as the applicant ’ s in the 2008 Criminal Code. It moreover notes that the resultant lacuna in the legislation pertained for three years (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 39 ) and that no special reasons have been adduced by the Government to justify it (see, by contrast, Ruban v. Ukraine, no. 8927/11, § 45, 12 July 2016 )."

The Court considers that the above situation, which was acknowledged by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 13, 16 and 26 above ) as well as the Government (see paragraph 42 above), contravened the principle of legality, by which the requirement that a penalty must be clearly defined in law is an essential part (see paragraphs 46 to 48 above). It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so. The Court notes in this connection that while the courts were certainly the best placed to interpret and apply domestic law, they were at the same time bound by the principle, embodied in Article 7 of the Convention, that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 105). It finds that the only way for the courts to have ensured the observance of this principle and to mitigate the effects of the law ’ s unpredictability in the present case would have been to interpret the deficient provision restrictively, that is to say to the advantage of the applicant."

In this regard, the Court observes that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code could be applied to the applicant by either disregarding the lower limit, pursuant to which the overall sentence should have exceeded each individual sentence, or by disregarding the upper limit, pursuant to which the overall prison sentence should not have exceeded the maximum ceiling of twenty years. It is clear from the foregoing that the more favourable to the applicant would have been the first option, which, most importantly, would have complied with the maximum limit on the overall sentence explicitly provided in the legislation (see paragraph 22 above) and thus avoided filling the legislative lacuna by way of extensive judicial interpretation."

In justifying their conclusion they had regard to, inter alia, other penalties set out in the 2008 Criminal Code; the overall sentence of thirty years ’ imprisonment set out in the ( then no longer valid ) 1994 Criminal Code; the purpose of the overall sentence; and the legislature ’ s intent which, in the Supreme Court ’ s view, had been later realised in the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 26. above)."

The Court therefore notes that the domestic courts interpreted the deficient legal provisions by resorting to different canons of interpretation and thereby coming to the conclusion that it should be understood as imposing a sentence of thirty years. They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention. It further finds that the overall penalty imposed on the applicant was in violation of both the principle that only the law can prescribe a penalty and the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law."

The Court is aware of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 6 June 2000 (see paragraph 82 above) in which the Supreme Court attached importance to the creation of danger as damage. However, it notes that no criteria had been developed for assessing such a risk. Moreover, in the present case the applicant actually acted under an obligation to conduct the privatisation of ER, having to balance risks relating to proceeding with the privatisation against those relating to withdrawal from the agreement. The Court considers that the applicant could not reasonably foresee that his acts would be deemed to amount to causing significant damage – on account of the alleged creation of a risk of damage – within the meaning of Article 161, as interpreted and applied in the present case."

In respect of the alleged causing of significant moral damage to the interests of the State, the Court considers that this assessment was made by the courts retroactively on the basis of their discretionary judgment and it was not susceptible of proof. Indeed, the applicant ’ s attempt to adduce evidence showing that the reputation of the State had not been damaged was turned down by the courts. It appears that the fact of an alleged violation of law by the applicant in itself served as an irrebuttable presumption that he had caused moral damage to the interests of the State. So broad an interpretation could, in principle, render any breach of law a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 161. Moreover, any such moral damage would have to be qualified as “ significant ”. The Court takes note in this context of the attempts in the Supreme Court ’ s case-law to lay down criteria for an assessment whether there existed in a given case any non-pecuniary damage and whether this damage was “ordinary, significant or large-scale” (see paragraph 80 and the following, above). However, in the Court ’ s view, the criteria used by the domestic courts in the present case to establish that the applicant had caused “significant” non-pecuniary damage – that he had been a high-ranking state official who had been working in a field attracting great public interest and that his acts had been incompatible with “the general sense of justice” – were too vague.

While it is true that the prosecuting authorities ’ reassessment of facts and reconsideration of their position in respect of the lawfulness of a certain course of action is not in itself at variance with the Convention, the Court notes that in the present case the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office radically changed its position within the space of a few days without any substantial change in the circumstances. Thus the Court finds force in the applicant ’ s argument that in proceeding with the process for the privatisation of ER he could legitimately rely on the prosecuting authorities ’ interpretation to the effect that his actions had been lawful, that opinion having also been shared by the other high-ranking participants in the privatisation proceedings. Even though the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office was not bound by its initial position, the radical change in the interpretation of the applicable law also demonstrates, in the circumstances, its insufficient clarity and foreseeability."

Considering the possible claims which had not been disclosed on the balance sheet of ER, the amount and validity of which were unclear, the parties to the privatisation agreement agreed on certain guarantees, formulated in section 9.1.1 (p) of the agreement. Under this provision, the State undertook to provide BRS with the opportunity to examine all circumstances concerning the claims and court cases in relation to AS Valga Külmvagunite Depoo and its insolvency proceedings. If BRS were to discover risks substantially and actually affecting the value of ER that it could not have evaluated at the time of the signing of the privatisation agreement, the parties undertook to solve such questions at the latest by 29 June 2001 in good faith and by mutual agreement. For example, it was possible that the State would give BRS by 29 June 2001 an additional warranty whereby the State would take partial and limited liability for the claims of AS Valga Külmvagunite Depoo against ER under certain conditions.

The existence or absence of non-pecuniary damage and also the quantitative dimension of non-pecuniary damage (whether it is ordinary, significant or large-scale non-pecuniary damage) has to be established by a court in each individual case.",

The extent of the damage can also be affected by factors such as the status of the official position ... of the person who had committed the act, the duration of the corrupt activity, whether it was a single instance or systematic, the number of persons affected by the unjustified or unlawful acts or decisions and their location at the local, national or international level, the type of the damage caused – the level of the ... authorities whose reputation was damaged, to what extent their credibility was damaged, whether there was interference in the normal functioning of the state authority and what that interference was, and so on.

In the explanatory memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Justice, it was stated that the purpose of repealing that Article was to limit the responsibility of an official for the misuse of his or her official position to cases where significant pecuniary damage had been caused to another person (a new offence of breach of confidence was proposed to that effect). It was stated in the memorandum that broad and vague definitions of the necessary elements of offences were in conflict with the general principle of legal certainty and the nulla poena sine lege principle laid down in the Constitution (Articles 13 § 2 and 23, respectively). It was reiterated that it had to be sufficiently clear to a person what kind of (lawful) conduct was expected from him or her and which circumstances determined his or her liability.

                "Another reason provided in the explanatory memorandum for repealing Article 289 of the Penal Code was that an assessment of the significance of non-pecuniary damage caused by misuse of official position made by a court retroactively constituted a discretionary decision. Accordingly, it could be difficult for an official to predict at the time of commission of the act whether the non-pecuniary damage caused by him or her could, based on the general principles of law, be regarded as “significant” for the purposes of the definition of misuse of official position. Hence, at the time of committing the act it might not be possible to predict with sufficient certainty whether the particular misuse of official position resulting in non-pecuniary damage was punishable as a criminal offence or not. Thus, according to the memorandum, it could be concluded that in the case of a vague definition of an offence, there was a risk that damage might be deemed to be caused merely on the ground that a breach of regulations had been committed, and this, in principle, made it possible to bring charges against an official for any kind of misuse of office.

In a decision of 28 June 2005 (case no. 3-1-1-24-05), the Criminal Law Chamber of the Supreme Court raised several important issues in connection with the application of the law in cases of misuse of official position under Article 161 of the Criminal Code. The criminal case concerned charges against a person who held an official position in a public limited company. The Criminal Law Chamber noted that in its earlier case-law it had explicitly accepted that non-pecuniary damage could be caused to legal persons in public law, first and foremost to the State (including a specific government agency) and to local government bodies. However, according to the case-law of the Civil Law Chamber of the Supreme Court, a legal person could not claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage. Accordingly, the Criminal Law Chamber referred the case to the plenary Supreme Court to obtain an authoritative ruling.",
                "The Criminal Law Chamber in the above case also raised the issue of whether, if a commercial company were to be able to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage, Article 161 of the Criminal Code was partially contrary to the Constitution. It noted that Articles 13 § 2 and 23 § 2 of the Constitution and Article 7 § 1 of the Convention embodied the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege certa ). It referred to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in which the Court had found that an offence had to be clearly defined in law and that this requirement was satisfied where the individual could know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions would make him criminally liable (see Veeber (no. 2), cited above, § 31 ). The Criminal Law Chamber noted that criminal liability for misuse of an official position under Article 161 of the Criminal Code was dependent on whether the damage caused was “significant”. While there existed criteria to assess whether the pecuniary damage was “significant”, there were no objective criteria to determine the extent of non-pecuniary damage. The latter was expressed in the opinion of the court, for the purposes of which the court would consider the general principles of law, the level of society ’ s general welfare and case-law.",
                "Accordingly, the Criminal Law Chamber observed, a court ’ s retrospective assessment of the significance of non-pecuniary damage caused by misuse of official position was a discretionary decision. Therefore, it could be difficult for an official to predict at the time of the commission of an act whether on the basis of the general principles of law the non-pecuniary damage caused by him or her would amount to “significant” damage within the meaning of the offence of misuse of official position. Thus, at least in cases not covered by earlier case-law, it was not necessarily predictable with sufficient certainty whether a particular act of misuse of official position causing non-pecuniary damage would be punishable as a criminal offence.",
                "However, by a judgment of 4 November 2005, the plenary Supreme Court acquitted the defendant in the above case on the grounds that the act committed by him had not corresponded to the elements of the offence under Article 161 of the Criminal Code.

The conclusion made in the bill of indictment that [the defendant] “[had] damaged fair competition as a basis of the market economy, and thus had damaged other persons ’ rights and interests”, did not make it clear who were the “other persons” referred to whose rights and interests [the defendant] had damaged, what change was caused in the situation of the legally protected interests of these persons by the alleged damage and what was the extent of the damage. Charges of causing significant damage, which do not specify the injured person or the facts on the basis of which one could render a legal opinion on the nature and extent of the alleged damage, are not specific enough and the courts are not able to establish the existence of significant damage as a necessary element of the criminal offence on the basis of such charges.",

It does not appear from the bill of indictment ... in whose eyes and to what extent the trust in the impartiality and integrity of the highest official of the executive body had been undermined as a result of the act committed by the defendant and what were the circumstances that had evidenced the undermining of the trust. In other words, the charges did not point to any facts which, if established, would have allowed the courts to conclude that [the defendant ’ s] act had actually undermined the credibility of state officials or to render a legal opinion as to whether such a consequence could be regarded as damage caused to a person and whether this damage was “significant” within the meaning of Article 300 of [the Penal Code]. Hence, the charges of causation of significant damage brought against [the defendant] were not specific enough in the part concerning the alleged casting of doubt on the integrity and credibility of the highest state officials either.",
                "21. ... [Contrary to the requirements of the criminal procedure law], the courts were not guided – in establishing the consequence as a necessary element of the offence – by evidence which would have proved that actual changes in the reputation of state officials had occurred in the real world and that these changes had been caused by the act [of the defendant] but, instead, they were merely guided by the legal assessment of the nature of the violation committed by [the defendant]. In other words, the County Court and the Court of Appeal eliminated the boundary between the act and the consequence, considering that the breach of a law was automatically also a consequence.",
                "22. ... [I]n criminal proceedings, none of the facts required to be proved, including consequence as a necessary element of an offence, can be established on the basis of a legal opinion. This is because a legal opinion says nothing about the changes that actually occurred or did not occur in the real world as a result of the act. A normative understanding according to which an unlawful act committed by the accused is of such a kind that it would undermine the trust of an “average person” in the integrity and impartiality of state officials cannot justify the conclusion that, in a specific case, there actually is a sufficient number of persons who are aware of this unlawful act and whose trust in the integrity and credibility of state officials is undermined as a result of this particular act.",

In connection with the charge against [the defendant] that he “created a situation where there was a real danger to the purposeful and economical use of the funds from the state budget in the amount of at least 17,661,017 kroons”, the Criminal Chamber wishes to make it clear that creation of a danger and causing damage are two different types of consequences that constitute necessary elements of an offence. Creation of a danger (emergence of a dangerous situation) can be regarded as an increase in the possibility of actual damage being caused, and it comprises a necessary element of an offence only in the case of a specific danger -creating delict [ ohudelikt ], that is if the definition of the offence mentions the creation of a danger as a consequence being one of the necessary elements of the offence .... If the definition of an offence mentions the causation of some kind of damage as a consequence being one of the necessary elements of the offence ... it is a delict consisting in the causation of material damage [ materiaalne kahjustusdelikt ]. The necessary elements of this type of offence are present only if actual damage – and not merely an increase in the possibility of damage being caused – has been caused as a result of the act. ...”",

He concluded that the rules on the basis of which he had been convicted were ambiguous and he had been held criminally responsible in a random way and within a vague framework. His prosecution for and conviction of causing moral damage to the Republic of Estonia with a reference to an abstract “general sense of justice” was totally incomprehensible."

He also emphasised that for the same reasons the interpretation of the creation of danger and causing damage had been completely changed by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 86 above). The fact that Parliament and the Supreme Court had only in 2007 come to the conclusion that the provisions and principles underlying the applicant ’ s conviction had been contrary to the Constitution and the Convention did not render his conviction in 2004 lawful – this had been at that time too contrary to the principle of nullum crimen sine lege."

Although the description of offences related to official position was inevitably characterised by a certain degree of abstraction, there existed a body of settled case-law which was published and accessible and the applicant had been able to foresee that his acts would constitute a criminal offence. On the basis of the case-law it must have been clear to the applicant that Article 161 was also applicable in cases of moral damage, that the danger of causing damage was sufficient to constitute an element of the offence and that the knowledge of the authorities about the misuse of the official position would not rule out the liability of an official.

The Court reiterates that the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 35, Series A no. 335 ‑ B, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 33, Series A no. 335 ‑ C ). Accordingly, it embodies, in general terms, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260 ‑ A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII; Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ ...; and Kafkaris v.

Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Kafkaris, cited above, §§ 139-140, with further references)."

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30, and Kokkinakis, cited above, § 40). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

The text of this provision did not mention the mere creation of a risk as comprising such damage. The Court is aware of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 6 June 2000 (see paragraph 82 above) in which the Supreme Court attached importance to the creation of danger as damage. However, it notes that no criteria had been developed for assessing such a risk. Moreover, in the present case the applicant actually acted under an obligation to conduct the privatisation of ER, having to balance risks relating to proceeding with the privatisation against those relating to withdrawal from the agreement. The Court considers that the applicant could not reasonably foresee that his acts would be deemed to amount to causing significant damage – on account of the alleged creation of a risk of damage – within the meaning of Article 161, as interpreted and applied in the present case."

In respect of the alleged causing of significant moral damage to the interests of the State, the Court considers that this assessment was made by the courts retroactively on the basis of their discretionary judgment and it was not susceptible of proof. Indeed, the applicant ’ s attempt to adduce evidence showing that the reputation of the State had not been damaged was turned down by the courts. It appears that the fact of an alleged violation of law by the applicant in itself served as an irrebuttable presumption that he had caused moral damage to the interests of the State. So broad an interpretation could, in principle, render any breach of law a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 161. Moreover, any such moral damage would have to be qualified as “ significant ”. The Court takes note in this context of the attempts in the Supreme Court ’ s case-law to lay down criteria for an assessment whether there existed in a given case any non-pecuniary damage and whether this damage was “ordinary, significant or large-scale” (see paragraph 80 and the following, above). However, in the Court ’ s view, the criteria used by the domestic courts in the present case to establish that the applicant had caused “significant” non-pecuniary damage – that he had been a high-ranking state official who had been working in a field attracting great public interest and that his acts had been incompatible with “the general sense of justice” – were too vague.

While it is true that the prosecuting authorities ’ reassessment of facts and reconsideration of their position in respect of the lawfulness of a certain course of action is not in itself at variance with the Convention, the Court notes that in the present case the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office radically changed its position within the space of a few days without any substantial change in the circumstances. Thus the Court finds force in the applicant ’ s argument that in proceeding with the process for the privatisation of ER he could legitimately rely on the prosecuting authorities ’ interpretation to the effect that his actions had been lawful, that opinion having also been shared by the other high-ranking participants in the privatisation proceedings. Even though the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office was not bound by its initial position, the radical change in the interpretation of the applicable law also demonstrates, in the circumstances, its insufficient clarity and foreseeability."

Moreover, they themselves had implemented or maintained that regime, by superimposing on the statutory provisions, published in the GDR’s Official Gazette, secret orders and service instructions on the consolidation and improvement of the border-protection installations and the use of firearms. In the order to fire given to border guards they had insisted on the need to protect the GDR’s borders “at all costs” and to arrest “border violators” or “annihilate” them (see paragraph 15 above). The applicants were therefore directly responsible for the situation which obtained at the border between the two German States from the beginning of the 1960s until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989."

Secondly, the Federal Court of Justice reclassified the offences according to the criminal law of the FRG and amended the charges against the two applicants to intentional homicide as indirect principals ( Totschlag in mittelbarer Täterschaft ) (Articles 25 and 212 of the StGB – see paragraph 44 below). The length of the sentences to which the applicants were liable remained unchanged. Like the Regional Court, the Federal Court of Justice joined the cases of the first and second applicants.",

The applicants knew that these orders would be obeyed and that fugitives had died at the border as a result of acts of violence. Like the Regional Court, the Federal Court of Justice held that the two applicants could not plead in justification section 27(2) of the State Borders Act. It ruled that section 27(2) and its interpretation by the GDR regime flagrantly infringed human rights and in particular the right to freedom of movement and the right to life enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty ratified by the GDR on 8 November 1974 (see paragraph 40 below). The fact that the GDR had not transposed those provisions into its domestic law did not alter its obligations under public international law. Lastly, the Regional Court’s decision had not contravened Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law ( Grundgesetz – see paragraph 43 below) since the applicants could not rely on a ground of justification ( Rechtfertigungsgrund ) which was contrary to higher-ranking legal rules.

The first, second and third appellants [Mr Hans Albrecht, who did not lodge any application with the Court, Mr Kessler and Mr Streletz] further submitted that they had been victims of the violation of a right guaranteed by Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law in that they had been convicted, pursuant to the law of the Federal Republic, as indirect principals [ mittelbare Täter ].",

                "1. (a) Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law is an expression of the principle of the rule of law ... This principle forms the basis for the use of civil rights and liberties, by guaranteeing legal certainty, by subjecting State power to statute law and by protecting trust. In addition, the principle of the rule of law includes, as one of the guiding ideas behind the Basic Law, the requirement of objective justice ... In the sphere of the criminal law, these concerns relating to the rule of law are reflected in the principle that no penalty may be imposed where there is no guilt. That principle is at the same time rooted in the human dignity and personal responsibility which are presupposed by the Basic Law and constitutionally protected by Articles 1 § 1 and 2 § 1 thereof, and to which the legislature must have regard when framing the criminal law ... It also underlies Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law ...",
                "Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law secures these aims by allowing conviction only for acts which, at the time when they were committed, were defined by statute with sufficient precision as criminal offences. It further prohibits the imposition of a higher penalty than the one prescribed by law at the time when the offence was committed. In the interests of legal certainty and justice, it provides that in the sphere of the criminal law, which permits extremely serious interference with personal rights by the State, only the legislature may determine what offences shall be punishable. Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law thus reinforces the rule of law by strictly reserving law-making to Parliament ... The citizen’s trust is earned by the fact that Article 103 § 2 gives him the assurance that the State will punish only acts which, at the time when they were committed, had been defined by Parliament as criminal offences, and for which it had prescribed specific penalties. That allows the citizen to regulate his conduct, on his own responsibility, in such a way as to avoid committing a punishable offence. This prohibition of the retroactive application of the criminal law is absolute ... It fulfils its role of guaranteeing the rule of law and fundamental rights by laying down a strict formal rule, and in that respect it is to be distinguished from other guarantees of the rule of law ...",
                "(b) Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law protects against retroactive modification of the assessment of the wrongfulness of an act to the offender’s detriment ... Accordingly, it also requires that a statutory ground of justification which could be relied on at the time when an act was committed should continue to be applied even where, by the time criminal proceedings begin, it has been abolished. However, where justifications are concerned, in contrast to the definition of offences and penalties, the strict reservation of Parliament’s law-making prerogative does not apply. In the sphere of the criminal law, grounds of justification may also be derived from customary law or case-law. Where grounds of justification not derived from written law, but nevertheless recognised at the material time, subsequently cease to be applied, the question arises whether and to what extent Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law likewise protects the expectation that they will continue to be applied. No general answer to that question need be given here, because in the instant case a justification – based partly on legal provisions and partly on administrative instructions and practice – has been advanced in circumstances that make it possible to restrict the absolute prohibition of retroactiveness in Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law.",
                "(aa) Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law contemplates as the normal case that the offence was committed and falls within the scope of the substantive criminal law of the Federal Republic of Germany, as shaped by the Basic Law, and that it is being judged in that context. In this normal case the criminal law, having been enacted in accordance with the precepts of democracy, the separation of powers and respect for fundamental rights, and therefore meeting in principle the requirements of objective justice [ materielle Gerechtigkeit ], provides the rule-of-law basis [ rechtsstaatliche Anknüpfung ] necessary for the absolute, strict protection of trust afforded by Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law.",
                "(bb) This principle no longer applies unrestrictedly in that, as a consequence of reunification, and as agreed in the Unification Treaty, Article 315 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, taken together with Article 2 of that Code, provides that GDR criminal law is to be applied when criminal proceedings are brought in respect of offences committed in the former GDR. That rule is a consequence of the Federal Republic’s assumption of responsibility for the administration of criminal justice in the territory of the GDR; it is accordingly compatible with Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law, since citizens of the former GDR are tried according to the criminal law that was applicable to them at the material time, the law of the Federal Republic in force at the time of conviction being applied only if it is more lenient. However, this legal situation, in which the Federal Republic has to exercise its authority in criminal matters on the basis of the law of a State that neither practised democracy and the separation of powers nor respected fundamental rights, may lead to a conflict between the mandatory rule-of-law precepts of the Basic Law and the absolute prohibition of retroactiveness in Article 103 § 2 thereof, which, as has been noted, derives its justification in terms of the rule of law [ rechtsstaatliche Rechtfertigung ] in the special trust reposed in criminal statutes when these have been enacted by a democratic legislature required to respect fundamental rights. This special basis of trust no longer obtains where the other State statutorily defines certain acts as serious criminal offences while excluding the possibility of punishment by allowing grounds of justification covering some of those acts and even by requiring and encouraging them notwithstanding the provisions of written law, thus gravely breaching the human rights generally recognised by the international community. By such means those vested with State power set up a system so contrary to justice that it can survive only for as long as the State authority which brought it into being actually remains in existence.",
                "In this wholly exceptional situation, the requirement of objective justice, which also embraces the need to respect the human rights recognised by the international community, makes it impossible for a court to accept such justifications. Absolute protection of the trust placed in the guarantee given by Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law must yield precedence, otherwise the administration of criminal justice in the Federal Republic would be at variance with its rule-of-law premisses [ rechtsstaatliche Prämissen ]. A citizen now subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the Federal Republic is barred from relying on such grounds of justification; in all other respects the principle of trust continues to apply, every citizen enjoying the guarantee that if he is convicted it will be on the basis of the law applicable to him at the time when the offence was committed.",
                "(cc) The Federal Republic has experienced similar conflicts when dealing with the crimes of National-Socialism.",
                "1. In that connection, the Supreme Court of Justice for the British Zone, and later the Federal Court of Justice, ruled on the question whether an act might become punishable retroactively if a provision of written law was disregarded on account of a gross breach of higher-ranking legal principles. They took the view that there could be provisions and instructions that had to be denied the status of law, notwithstanding their claim to constitute law, because they infringed legal principles which applied irrespective of whether they were recognised by the State; whoever had behaved in accordance with such provisions remained punishable ... The Federal Court of Justice pointed out that in such cases the conduct of the offenders was not being judged by criteria which had acquired general validity only later. Nor were the offenders being called upon to answer the charges against them on the basis of criteria not yet valid or no longer valid at the material time. It could not be supposed that the offenders were not already familiar at the material time with the relevant principles, which were indispensable to human coexistence and belonged to the inviolable core of the law ...",
                "2. The Federal Constitutional Court has so far had to deal with the problem of ‘statutory injustice’ [ gesetzliches Unrecht ] only in spheres other than that of the criminal law. It has taken the view that in cases where positive law is intolerably inconsistent with justice the principle of legal certainty may have to yield precedence to that of objective justice. In that connection it has referred to the writings of Gustav Radbruch [ Gustav Radbruch (1878-1949): German professor of law who considerably influenced the philosophy of law. Following the crimes of the Nazis, he formulated the principle, also known as “Radbruch’s formula” ( Radbruch’sche Formel ), that positive law must be considered contrary to justice where the contradiction between statute law and justice is so intolerable that the former must give way to the latter] ... and, in particular, to what has become known as Radbruch’s formula ... On that point it has repeatedly stressed that positive law should be disapplied only in absolutely exceptional cases and that a merely unjust piece of legislation, which is unacceptable on any enlightened view, may nevertheless, because it also remains inherently conducive to order, still acquire legal validity and thus create legal certainty... However, the period of National-Socialist rule had shown that the legislature was capable of imposing gross ‘wrong’ by statute ..., so that, where a statutory provision was intolerably inconsistent with justice, that provision should be disapplied from the outset ...",
                "2. The decisions challenged meet the constitutional criterion set forth under 1.",
                "(a) The Federal Court of Justice has since further developed its case-law when trying cases of so-called ‘government criminality’ [ Regierungskriminalität ] during the Socialist Unity Party regime in the GDR ... That case-law also forms the basis for the decisions challenged here. It states that a court must disregard a justification if it purports to exonerate the intentional killing of persons who sought nothing more than to cross the intra-German border unarmed and without endangering interests generally recognised as enjoying legal protection, because such a justification, which puts the prohibition on crossing the border above the right to life, must remain ineffective on account of a manifest and intolerable infringement of elementary precepts of justice and of human rights protected under international law. The infringement in question is so serious as to offend against the legal beliefs concerning the worth and dignity of human beings that are common to all peoples. In such a case positive law has to give way to justice.",
                "The Federal Court of Justice described the relationship between the criteria which together make up Radbruch’s formula and the human rights protected under international law as being that the criteria of Radbruch’s formula, which were difficult to apply because of their imprecision, had been supplemented by more specific assessment criteria, since the international human rights covenants provided a basis for determining when a State was infringing human rights according to the convictions of the world-wide legal community.",
                "(b) That assessment is in keeping with the Basic Law. It is also supported by this Court’s judgment of 31 July 1973 on the Basic Treaty [ Grundlagenvertrag ], which acknowledged that the GDR’s practice at the intra-German border was inhuman, and that the Wall, the barbed wire, the ‘death strip’ [ Todesstreifen ] and the shoot-to-kill order were incompatible with the treaty obligations entered into by the GDR ...",
                "(c) Against the finding that a ground of justification derived from State practice and purporting to allow ‘border violators’ to be killed must be disregarded as an instance of extreme State injustice, it cannot be objected by the appellants that the right to life and the right to freedom of movement are not unreservedly guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that even democratic States of the Western type, based on the rule of law, have adopted legal provisions which expressly provide for the use of firearms under certain circumstances, particularly in connection with the pursuit and arrest of criminals. Admittedly, the wording of the GDR’s legal provisions, in so far as they regulated the use of firearms at the intra-German border, corresponded to that of the Federal Republic’s provisions on the use of force [ unmittelbarer Zwang ]. But the findings in the impugned judgments show that, superimposed on those legal provisions, there were orders which left no room for limitation of the use of firearms according to the principle of proportionality, and which conveyed to the border guards on the spot the view of their superiors – and ultimately of the National Defence Council – that border violators were to be ‘annihilated’ if they could not be prevented from crossing the border by other means. Through that subordination of the individual’s right to life to the State’s interest in preventing border crossings, the written law was eclipsed by the requirements of political expediency. Objectively speaking, this constituted extreme injustice.",
                "(d) Nor can the appellants argue that, having accepted that a justification could be disregarded, the Federal Court of Justice had still not answered the question whether and in what circumstances the act thus held to be unlawful was punishable ... To establish punishability there is no need here for recourse to supra-positive legal principles [ überpositive Rechtsgrundsätze ]. Reference need only be made to the values which the GDR itself took as the basis for its criminal law. At the material time Articles 112 and 113 of the GDR’s Criminal Code absolutely prohibited the intentional taking of human life and marked the seriousness of such offences by prescribing severe punishment. If, for the reasons discussed above, there is no admissible ground of justification for a homicide, the definition of the offences in the above-mentioned provisions of criminal law makes such a homicide a punishable criminal offence.",
                "3. The first three appellants object that it was incompatible with Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law for the Federal Court of Justice, applying the law of the Federal Republic, to find them guilty of intentional homicide as indirect principals. That objection fails.",
                "The criminal courts established, on the basis of the provisions in force in the GDR at the material time, that the appellants had rendered themselves liable to punishment through their involvement in the killing of fugitives. The Federal Court of Justice expressly endorsed the Regional Court’s finding that according to those provisions the appellants were guilty of incitement to murder (Articles 2 § 2, sub-paragraph 1, and 112 § 1 of the GDR’s Criminal Code). Only at a second stage did the Federal Court of Justice apply the law of the Federal Republic of Germany, in one case on the basis of Article 315 § 4 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code taken together with Article 9 § 1 of the Criminal Code (the place-of-commission, or place-of-effect rule) and in the other cases under Article 315 § 1 of the Introductory Act taken together with Article 2 § 3 of the Criminal Code, the law of the Federal Republic being more lenient than that of the GDR. In neither case were those decisions contrary to Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law. Regarding the application of the place-of-commission rule, the Chamber [ Senat ] has already ruled on the issue in its decision of 15 May 1995 and it stands by that decision.",
                "In view of its protective purpose, Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law does not preclude the application of law more lenient than that applicable at the material time. The Federal Court of Justice, in agreement with academic writings ..., took the view that the more lenient law was the law which, on the basis of an overall comparison in the specific individual case, yielded a judgment more favourable to the offender, even if this or that criterion of assessment might appear to be less favourable than criteria laid down by the other law, the decisive factor being the legal consequences of the offence. That conclusion is compatible with the above-mentioned protective purpose of Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law and cannot be questioned on constitutional grounds.”",

The ex post facto interpretation of the GDR’s criminal law by the courts of reunified Germany was not based on any case-law of the GDR’s courts and would have been impossible for the applicants to foresee at the time of the events which gave rise to the charges. What had taken place, therefore, had not been a gradual development in the interpretation of GDR law but rather a total refusal to accept the justifications the applicants had pleaded, on the ground that these were contrary to the FRG’s Basic Law (Radbruch’s formula of “statutory injustice” – Radbruch’sche Formel des “gesetzlichen Unrechts” ).

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment.",

Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, § 52), Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ‘law’ Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see ... the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, § 37).",

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in ... the ... Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen.”",

This State practice was also in breach of the obligation to respect human rights and the other international obligations of the GDR, which, on 8 November 1974, had ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, expressly recognising the right to life and to the freedom of movement (see paragraph 40 above), regard being had to the fact that it was almost impossible for ordinary citizens to leave the GDR legally.

Moreover, they themselves had implemented or maintained that regime, by superimposing on the statutory provisions, published in the GDR’s Official Gazette, secret orders and service instructions on the consolidation and improvement of the border-protection installations and the use of firearms. In the order to fire given to border guards they had insisted on the need to protect the GDR’s borders “at all costs” and to arrest “border violators” or “annihilate” them (see paragraph 15 above).

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, both cited above, loc. cit. – paragraph 50). Admittedly, that concept applies in principle to the gradual development of case-law in a given State subject to the rule of law and under a democratic regime, factors which constitute the cornerstones of the Convention, as its preamble states (see paragraph 83 below), but it remains wholly valid where, as in the present case, one State has succeeded another."

However, once established, domicile is not lost by the mere loss of one of its constituent elements. For example, a person who is (temporarily) absent from the town where he or she has established his or her domicile will not lose that status if he or she wishes to live there permanently, that is, as long as he or she intends to return to it. Likewise, a person who has established his or her domicile in a particular town but no longer intends to (permanently) live there will not lose his or her domicile in that town while he or she still lives there, that is, as long as he or she does not actually move elsewhere."

In none of these opinions did the Customs Administration refer to the definition of domicile provided in either the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act or the General Tax Act. Rather, in one of the opinions (opinion of 31 May 2010) it cited the definition of habitual residence provided in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraph 32 above), whereas in four of the opinions (opinions of 22 November 2012 and of 3, 7 and 10 January 2013) it referred to the definition of habitual residence provided in the General Tax Act (see paragraph 31 above ). While in the first of the above-cited opinions (opinion of 19 December 2006 ) the Customs Administration held that persons having registered domicile in Croatia could not be considered to have habitual residence abroad, in another of the opinions it expressly stated that domicile was irrelevant for determining whether a person had habitual residence (opinion of 15 September 2011 )."

                "“The use of foreign goods in the customs territory of the Republic of Croatia, within the temporary importation procedure, is governed by sections 145-152 of the Customs Act and the corresponding provisions, that is, sections 260-297, of the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act, further to the International Convention on Temporary Admission.",
                "The basic rule in section 265 of the above - mentioned Decree is that motor vehicles registered outside the customs territory of the Republic of Croatia in the name of a person with habitual residence [ s uobičajenim boravištem ] outside the customs territory can be used (operated) in our country only by those persons who also have habitual residence [ uobičajeno boravište ] in another country (the notion of habitual residence implies permanent stay in a certain territory for at least 183 days in a year). In addition to foreign nationals residing in another country, Croatian nationals residing in a third country for work, study or other reasons who occasionally enter Croatia with their vehicles for a visit, holidays and the like may also benefit from this rule. In the case of customs control [aimed at] establishing whether the aforementioned conditions for the use of vehicles with foreign licence plates are met, it is necessary to provide as evidence a residence permit, residence registration [form] or [proof of] accommodation, employment, study or the like, abroad. ”",

                "The use of foreign goods in the customs territory of the Republic of Croatia, in particular cars with foreign licence plates, is permitted under the temporary importation procedure. In terms of the customs regulations, the temporary importation procedure, which is regulated by national legislation (sections 145-152 of the Customs Act and sections 260-297 of the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act) and by the International Convention on Temporary Admission (the Istanbul Convention), allows the temporary admission of goods with conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes ...",

                "That is why, for example, a motor vehicle with foreign licence plates may in the Republic of Croatia be driven exclusively by a foreign national with residence in the country of registration, another foreign national having residence in a third country, or by a Croatian national who has habitual place of residence abroad. [In those cases] the vehicle may altogether (that is, irrespective of the fact that it may occasionally leave the customs area of the Republic of Croatia) be present and used in ... Croatia for up to six months in a twelve-month period, after which the vehicle has to leave the customs area. A Croatian or foreign national who has habitual place of residence in ... Croatia, must not use a vehicle with foreign registration plates in Croatia, regardless of the fact he or she may possess a driving licence of the country of registration.",

In particular, in supervising the temporary admission of vehicles in accordance with Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission, during 2010 the Customs Administration carried out a total of 956 interventions [that is, spot-checks], of which in 302 cases it found irregularities, and [collected] customs debts in the total amount of HRK 5,664,943.11.”",

                "It follows ... that nationality alone, or even temporary residence granted to a person in a particular country, does not automatically entitle to or prohibit from the driving of cars with foreign licence plates in the customs territory of the Republic of Croatia. Rather, the persons in question have to prove their right to operate foreign vehicles by the available documents. This means that credible evidence has to be furnished that those persons ... do not live in the customs territory of the Republic of Croatia.",

Croatia ... is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of the available evidence, which the beneficiary of the temporary admission procedure has to obtain and present.”",

Yet, he had been convicted of the customs-related administrative offence specified in section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraphs 22-23 and 29 above). That was so only because the domestic authorities had misinterpreted the term “persons resident” in the Istanbul Convention as “persons having domicile”, which had a different meaning in the domestic legislation. He explained that the Istanbul Convention, in its official text, did not refer to “domicile” but to “living” abroad and that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements. Therefore, the fact that while living in Prague he could have, in the eyes of Croatian authorities, retained his domicile in Croatia was not relevant. What mattered for the application of the Istanbul Convention was whether he lived in the Czech Republic or in Croatia."

In the Government ’ s view, that meant that it was left to the States Parties to the Istanbul Convention to give meaning to that term themselves, that is, to interpret it independently, in accordance with their own legislation. The Croatian authorities had decided to interpret the term by equating it with the notion of domicile ( prebivalište ), which, according to the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act, is the place where a citizen has settled with an intention of permanently living there (see paragraph 32 above). Those authorities had considered the notion of domicile the most appropriate because it was the only one that denoted more permanent connection of Croatian citizens with their homeland."

Furthermore, section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act prescribed that treating goods which did not meet the conditions for temporary admission set forth in the Istanbul Convention as if they did was an administrative offence punishable by a fine (see paragraph 29 above). Given that at the time of the commission of the offence, that is, when the applicant had entered Croatia in his car with foreign licence plates without paying the relevant taxes, he had been a Croatian citizen and had his domicile in Croatia (see paragraph 6 above), he had not satisfied the conditions for temporary admission set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention. By the same token, his failure to pay the taxes due on the importation of his car had also made him liable for the administrative offence specified in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) of which he had eventually been convicted."

In particular, the applicant ’ s statement that he had entered Croatia with the intention of de - registering his domicile was (see paragraph 8 above), in the Government ’ s view, crucial evidence that he had known that having his domicile in Croatia made him ineligible for temporary admission and that by bringing his car to Croatia he had breached customs regulations. In fact, the Government argued, the applicant had never had the intention of de - registering his domicile. Rather, his real intention had been to continue living in Croatia, where he had accommodation and where his family lived, and to go only occasionally to the Czech Republic. He had de - registered his domicile in Croatia only to avoid paying the customs debt and escape liability for it. Thus, even though he had allegedly entered Croatia in order to de - register his domicile, he had not done so until 17 June 2008 (see paragraph 10 above), that is, six days after entering (see paragraph 8 above), and one day after the police had impounded his vehicle and the customs proceedings against him had commenced (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV ): (a) the classification of the offence under the domestic law, (b) the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

This follows from the fact that the fine imposed on the applicant was based on section 241(1) of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) and not on provisions of the Criminal Code; that such a fine is not entered in a person ’ s criminal record; and that its amount does not depend on income, as in criminal law.

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was not intended to serve as pecuniary compensation for unpaid customs duties but as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the purported customs-related administrative offence was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, §§ 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, § 38)."

                "“153. ... the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment ( ... ).",
                "154. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability ( ... ).",
                "155. The Court reiterates that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( ... ). ”"

Austria, no. 40825/98, § 90, 31 July 2008 ).

Under Article 7 the application of the provision of municipal penal law to an act not covered by the provision in question directly results in a conflict with the Convention, so that the Commission can and must take cognisance of allegations of such false interpretation of municipal law. The Commission ’ s supervisory function, therefore, consists in making sure that, at the moment when the accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted, there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable and that the punishment imposed does not exceed the limits fixed by that provision. ... [T]his supervisory function further consists in considering whether the national court, in reaching its decision, has not unreasonably interpreted, and applied to the applicant, the municipal law concerned.”"

Latvia, where it held that while it was primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, so that the Court ’ s role was confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation were compatible with the Convention, the position was different and the Court ’ s powers of review greater when it was not the domestic legislation but the Convention itself, in particular Article 7, which expressly referred to the domestic law, that is, required that there should be a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. In such cases, a failure to comply with the domestic legislation could in itself entail a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court had to have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law had been complied with as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, to accord it a lesser power of review would render Article 7 devoid of purpose. The Court also held that the same principle applied to situations where the domestic courts had applied international law (see Kononov v.

This inconsistency in translation indeed makes the meaning of the term in question ambiguous as it could mean either domicile or residence, it being understood that those terms legally do not have the same meaning not only under Croatian law (see paragraphs 31-32 above ) but also in a number of countries (see the relevant Council of Europe instrument in paragraph 60 above). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that, from a strictly linguistic point of view, the more accurate translation into Croatian of the English term “persons resident” or the French term “ personnes résidant ” appearing in the original versions of the Istanbul Convention is “ osobe s boravištem ” ( “ persons having residence ” ) rather than “ osobe s prebivalištem ” ( “ persons having domicile ” ). Croatian versions or translations of international or European law instruments that refer to the same or similar terms do not provide any assistance in this matter (see paragraphs 59 and 6 1 above).

In their view any ambiguity as to the meaning of the term “persons resident” had been dispelled by the fact that those authorities had uniformly and consistently interpreted it as “persons having domicile”, where the notion of domicile was construed in the light of the relevant domestic legislation, in particular with regard to the definition of domicile in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraphs 8 0 -8 1 above)."

The Court considers that this principle applies a fortiori in the context of Article 7 of the Convention ( see Matić and Polonia d.o.o., cited above, § 50 ), given that its object and purpose is to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see, among many other authorities, Vasiliauskas, cited above, § 153 ). No person should be forced to speculate, at peril of conviction, whether his or her conduct is prohibited or not, or to be exposed to unduly broad discretion of the authorities, in particular if it was possible, either by drafting legislation in more precise terms or through judicial interpretation, to specify the relevant provision in a way that would dispel uncertainty."

                "106. In conclusion, the Court reiterates that the wording of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention, and its Croatian translation in particular, gives rise to uncertainty and ambiguity (see paragraph 97 above), and that the interpretation of that provision by the domestic authorities was at the relevant time inconsistent (see paragraph 100-102 above) and therefore lacked the required precision. As a result thereof, the applicant was, even with informed legal advice, unable to distinguish between permissible and prohibited behaviour and thus unable to foresee, with the degree of certainty required by Article 7 of the Convention, that entering Croatia in his car, while arguably having a habitual residence in the Czech Republic, would constitute an offence (see paragraphs 93 and 104-105 above). By the same token, the room left to those authorities for the interpretation and application of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention was too wide to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 93 above).",

In particular, in reply to the Government ’ s non-exhaustion objection the applicant unequivocally stated:",

That being so, and given that the confiscation and sale of the applicant ’ s car occurred in the context of the administrative proceedings and not in the (administrative offence) proceedings actually complained of by the applicant, it follows that this complaint is inadmissible under Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention as manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4 thereof."
