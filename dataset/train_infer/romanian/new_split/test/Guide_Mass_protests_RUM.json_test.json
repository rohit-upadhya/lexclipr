The Court notes that the applicant considered his freedom of expression and of assembly to have been interfered with by the fact that the Cabinet of Ministers had adopted a negative decision regarding his application to acquire Latvian citizenship through naturalisation, thus punishing him for his views and having a chilling effect on the exercise of his freedoms. The Government distinguished between the decision not to grant citizenship through naturalisation and the right to freedom of expression, which could be freely exercised by the applicant with or without Latvian citizenship."

                "77. The applicant alleged that the refusal to grant him Latvian citizenship through naturalisation was a punitive measure in response to the views he had expressed at various demonstrations against the education reform. The Court observes, however, that the applicant had been able to express his views freely, which had been widely reported in the mass media at the time (see paragraphs 8, 15, 17 and 56 above). Besides, he continued to express his views on the education reform without any hindrance after his application for naturalisation was refused (see paragraphs 8 and 15 above). Furthermore, the applicant remained politically active and continued to express his views also on other matters of public interest (see paragraph 56 above). The Court notes that the availability or absence of a given civil status does not appear to have interfered with the applicant ’ s civic activities. Even though the applicant maintained that the decision regarding his naturalisation application had affected his courage to speak up and had, therefore, impeded his participation in debates on matters of public interest, the Government submitted ample evidence to the contrary (see paragraphs 8, 15, 17 and 56 above) and the applicant did not further substantiate his allegation or submit any proof in this connection. Nor is there any other information in the Court ’ s possession suggesting that the Government ’ s policy relating to citizenship may have generated a chilling effect for the applicant or those expressing similar views."

The applicant mentioned one tangible consequence of the refusal of naturalisation: he could not vote or stand for municipal and parliamentary elections, or elections to the European Parliament. However, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaint in the present case does not concern the rights laid down in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (contrast Ždanoka, cited above, § 73). Nor does the applicant allege a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of being unable to preserve his current civil status (contrast Kurić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], no. 26828/06, § 314, ECHR 2012). Above all, the Court ’ s decision on the admissibility of the present application determines the scope of the case currently before it and it does not include any complaints other than those under Articles 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention (see paragraphs 3 - 4 above)."

                "80. The Court will now assess whether the decision on naturalisation had any punitive character in relation to the exercise of the applicant ’ s freedom of expression and of assembly. In accordance with international law, decisions on naturalisation or any other form of granting of nationality are matters primarily falling within the domestic jurisdiction of the State; they are normally based on various criteria aimed at establishing a link between the State and the person requesting nationality (see paragraphs 37 - 38 above). While the European Convention on Nationality has not been widely ratified by the Council of Europe member States (see paragraph 39 above), as noted in its Explanatory Report, its definition relies on the traditional understanding of a bond of nationality as expressed by the ICJ in the Nottebohm Case (see paragraphs 40 - 41 above). The choice of the criteria for the purposes of a naturalisation procedure is not, in principle, subject to any particular rules of international law and the States are free to decide on individual naturalisation (see paragraph 38 above). In certain situations, however, the States ’ discretion may be limited by the principle of non-intervention, according to which a State is prohibited from interfering in the internal or foreign affairs of another State (see Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nicaragua v. United States of America ), Merits, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, paragraphs 202 ‑ 05). Nevertheless, such limitation cannot be considered of any relevance for the purposes of the present case."
            ],
            [
                "81. In this connection the applicant advanced two arguments to claim that the State ’ s discretion was not completely unfettered in matters relating to the granting of nationality. Firstly, he referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. However, as the Court has already noted above, under the Convention there is no “right to nationality” similar to that in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (see paragraph 73 above). The applicant ’ s reference to the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights is likewise misguided, since the American Convention on Human Rights, which is a regional instrument, explicitly provides for a right to nationality in its Article 20 (see paragraphs 43-45 above)."
            ],
            [
                "82. The applicant ’ s second argument was that the State ’ s discretion was limited by the obligation to reduce statelessness. The Court observes that the applicant belongs to a category of Latvian residents who were granted a specific civil status under domestic law – “permanently resident non-citizens” ( nepilsoņi ) – that is, citizens of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics who lost their Soviet citizenship following its dissolution but, while being so entitled, have not subsequently obtained any other nationality (see, for more details relating to categories of Latvian residents, Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, §§ 50-53, ECHR 2003-X, and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, §§ 46-47, ECHR 2007-I ). The applicant has not shown how the availability or not of a given status in domestic law would have affected his exercise of freedom of expression and of assembly."
            ],
            [
                "83. Turning now to the Convention system, the Court reiterates that in some circumstances it has ruled that arbitrary or discriminatory decisions in the field of nationality may raise issues in human rights law in general and under the Convention specifically (see the above-cited cases of Karassev; Riener, § 153; and Genovese, § 34). However, as noted above, neither the Convention nor international law in general provides for the right to acquire a specific nationality. The applicant has accepted this. The Court observes that there is nothing in the Latvian Citizenship Law to indicate that the applicant could unconditionally claim a right to Latvian citizenship (see paragraphs 20, 29 and 63 above) or that the negative decision of the Cabinet of Ministers could be seen as an arbitrary denial of such citizenship (contrast Genovese, cited above, § 34)."
            ],
            [
                "84. The issue whether or not the applicant has an arguable right to acquire citizenship of a State must in principle be resolved by reference to the domestic law of that State (see Kolosovskiy v. Latvia ( dec. ), no. 50183/99, 29 January 2004). Similarly, the question whether a person was denied a State ’ s citizenship arbitrarily in a manner that might raise an issue under the Convention is to be determined with reference to the terms of the domestic law (see Fehér and Dolník v. Slovakia ( dec. ), nos. 14927/12 and 30415/12, § 41, 21 May 2013). The choice of criteria for the purposes of granting citizenship through naturalisation in accordance with domestic law is linked to the nature of the bond between the State and the individual concerned that each society deems necessary to ensure. In many jurisdictions, acquisition of citizenship is accompanied by an oath of allegiance whereby the individual pledges loyalty to the State. The Court has addressed the issue of loyalty, albeit in a slightly different context of electoral rights, and drawn a distinction between loyalty to the State and loyalty to the government (see Tănase, cited above, § 166)."
            ],
            [
                "85. The Court notes that the assessment of loyalty for the purposes of the naturalisation decision in the present case does not refer to loyalty to the government in power, but rather to the State and its Constitution. The Court considers that a democratic State is entitled to require persons who wish to acquire its citizenship to be loyal to the State and, in particular, to the constitutional principles on which it is founded. The applicant did not contest this. The Court agrees with the applicant that, in exercising his freedom of expression and of assembly, he is free to disagree with government policies as long as that critique takes place in accordance with the law; it is also true that the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. However, this is an entirely different matter from the issue of the criteria laid down for naturalisation and the corresponding procedure, which are both determined by domestic law. The requirement of loyalty to the State and its Constitution cannot be regarded as a punitive measure capable of interfering with freedom of expression and of assembly. Rather, it is a criterion which has to be fulfilled by any person seeking to obtain Latvian citizenship through naturalisation."

The Education Law, which took effect on 1 June 1999, provided that the only language of instruction in all State and municipal schools in the Republic of Latvia would be the State language, that is, Latvian. It also provided that the language of instruction might be different in private schools, in State and municipal schools implementing national minority curricula and in other educational establishments as provided by law. As regards the State and municipal schools implementing national minority curricula, it was for the Ministry of Education to set out specific subjects to be taught in the State language (section 9(1) and (2)) and the Minister for Education was to ensure that the relevant regulations were submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers ( Ministru kabinets ) by 1 September 1999 (transitional provisions, paragraph 3).

Furthermore, nationality has its most immediate, its most far-reaching and, for most people, its only effects within the legal system of the State conferring it.

It may be said to constitute the juridical expression of the fact that the individual upon whom it is conferred, either directly by the law or as the result of an act of the authorities, is in fact more closely connected with the population of the State conferring nationality than with that of any other State. Conferred by a State, it only entitles that State to exercise protection vis-à-vis another State, if it constitutes a translation into juridical terms of the individual ’ s connection with the State which has made him its national.",

The classic doctrinal position, which viewed nationality as an attribute granted by the state to its subjects, has gradually evolved to the point that nationality is today perceived as involving the jurisdiction of the state as well as human rights issues.

Another instrument, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ... provides the following [text of Article 15].",

Two aspects of this right are reflected in Article 20 of the Convention: first, the right to a nationality established therein provides the individual with a minimal measure of legal protection in international relations through the link his nationality establishes between him and the state in question; and, second, the protection therein accorded the individual against the arbitrary deprivation of his nationality, without which he would be deprived for all practical purposes of all of his political rights as well as of those civil rights that are tied to the nationality of the individual.",
                "35. Nationality can be deemed to be the political and legal bond that links a person to a given state and binds him to it with ties of loyalty and fidelity, entitling him to diplomatic protection from that state. In different ways, most states have offered individuals who did not originally possess their nationality the opportunity to acquire it at a later date, usually through a declaration of intention made after complying with certain conditions. In these cases, nationality no longer depends on the fortuity of birth in a given territory or on parents having that nationality; it is based rather on a voluntary act aimed at establishing a relationship with a given political society, its culture, its way of life and its values.",
                "36. Since it is the state that offers the possibility of acquiring its nationality to persons who were originally aliens, it is natural that the conditions and procedures for its acquisition should be governed primarily by the domestic law of that state. As long as such rules do not conflict with superior norms, it is the state conferring nationality which is best able to judge what conditions to impose to ensure that an effective link exists between the applicant for naturalization and the systems of values and interests of the society with which he seeks to fully associate himself. That state is also best able to decide whether these conditions have been complied with. Within these same limits, it is equally logical that the perceived needs of each state should determine the decision whether to facilitate naturalization to a greater or lesser degree; and since a state ’ s perceived needs do not remain static, it is quite natural that the conditions for naturalization might be liberalized or restricted with the changed circumstances. It is therefore not surprising that at a given moment new conditions might be imposed to ensure that a change of nationality not be effected to solve some temporary problems encountered by the applicants when these have not established real and lasting ties with the country, which would justify an act as serious and far-reaching as the change of nationality.”"

He submitted that the Advisory Opinion of the Permanent Court of International Justice on Nationality Decrees Issued in Tunisia and Morocco and the Nottebohm Case, both cited above, reflected the situation of international law in 1923 and 1955, respectively, and not at the present time. He argued that there was an emerging international consensus that nationality laws and practice had to be consistent with general principles of international law, in particular human rights law. State discretion in granting nationality was not completely unfettered; referring to Article 15 § 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the applicant argued that decisions concerning nationality were to be examined in the light of human rights. He cited paragraphs 32 and 140, respectively, of two relevant cases before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (see paragraphs 43 - 44 above). The applicant alleged that the Inter-American approach was also confirmed in Europe, relying on Article 4 of the European Convention on Nationality and its Explanatory Report. The applicant described his status as a “non-citizen” and considered himself a “privileged” stateless person in terms of international law. He also referred to the Nottebohm Case, cited above, and explained that he had been born in Latvia, his habitual residence and centre of interests were in Latvia, and his wife and two daughters lived in Latvia.

Finland (( dec. ), no. 31414/96, ECHR 1999 ‑ II) and argued that arbitrary denial of citizenship might in certain circumstances raise an issue under Article 8 of the Convention because of the impact on the rights of an individual. He further referred to the case of Genovese v. Malta (no. 53124/09, § 45, 11 October 2011), where the Court had found a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 concerning access to citizenship. The applicant argued that it had been found in other international fora that national competence for the establishment of rules on citizenship was not exclusive; he referred to the above-cited Janko Rottmann case before the Court of Justice of the European Union as an example. He also argued that for the purposes of the present case the obligation to reduce statelessness limited State discretion and, relying on Andrejeva v.

The applicant conceded that he did not have a right to acquire Latvian citizenship under the Convention; his argument was that his rights under Articles 10 and 11 had been breached during the naturalisation process. Nothing in the Court ’ s case-law suggested that only issues under Articles 8 and 14 could arise. It was his view that “arbitrary denial of citizenship” could also raise issues under Articles 10 and 11. The applicant argued that there was a sufficient causal link between his participation in activities against the introduction of the State language of the Republic of Latvia in schools which had the Russian language as their language of instruction and the subsequent decision of the Cabinet of Ministers to refuse his naturalisation. He considered that “the denial of citizenship” was a punitive measure used against him in response to his activities and statements."

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 64, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The refusal to grant him Latvian citizenship had had a number of immediate consequences. He mentioned one such example: the fact that he could not stand for the municipal elections held in 2005 because he could reapply for naturalisation only after one year had passed (section 12(6) of the Citizenship Law). Such a consequence had not been foreseeable given the positive opinion of the security police. The applicant remained a “non-citizen” and was excluded from fully-fledged participation in the political process.

More generally, the applicant submitted that the measures taken by the domestic authorities were capable of discouraging the participation of “non-citizens” in debates over matters of legitimate public concern (he cited Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

The applicant further alleged that the Government had not provided evidence as to his alleged calls to overthrow the government, to use violence and to trigger an international scandal. The applicant was surprised that the Government had referred to media reports in order to substantiate the allegations, when more objective evidence could have been found. He referred to the positive opinion by the security police and mentioned that he had been punished only once with a written warning for participation in a demonstration and that no criminal sanctions had ever been imposed on him; media reports only reflected the opinions of their authors. He relied on the same statements from the media (see paragraph 17 above) to argue that his protests had been staged only against the particular government led by the Prime Minister, and the ruling coalition, not against any legitimate government whatsoever; that he had not wished to use any violence; his invitation “to a boxing contest in a police sports club” had been made to avoid any violence on the streets.

In addition, they mentioned that in 2012 the applicant had been one of the organisers of a collection of signatures to initiate a referendum on citizenship for “non-citizens”. In the same year, the applicant had participated in establishing a body called “the Congress of Non-Citizens”, and within it, on 1 June 2013, he had been elected as a member of a self-proclaimed “Parliament of the Unrepresented”.

In the present case, however, the refusal to grant citizenship had only had one immediate consequence – the inability at a given moment in time to obtain Latvian citizenship.

By contrast, the refusal of Latvian citizenship through naturalisation in the present case did not irreversibly entail any difficulties for the applicant as he could reapply for Latvian citizenship.

Firstly, the Naturalisation Board carried out the administrative task of receiving and reviewing individual applications to determine whether or not they met the criteria laid down by law, and its decision was amenable to judicial review pursuant to section 17(3) of the Citizenship Law. Secondly, the Cabinet of Minister ’ s task was one of a discretionary nature, among other things to take account of political considerations including the person ’ s loyalty to the Republic of Latvia.

While acknowledging that in principle Article 10 of the Convention protected the right to express oneself in a way which offended, shocked or disturbed, the Government also noted that a person exercising his freedom of expression undertook duties and responsibilities, the scope of which depended on the particular situation (they referred to Handyside, cited above, § 49). In the Government ’ s view, the applicant had a duty to choose the means by which he wished to achieve his goals and refrain from provocative statements regarding the possibility of using violence, thus undermining the fundamental values of democratic society.

Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position. Pluralism and democracy must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 128, ECHR 2014, with further references ). Respect by the State of the views of a minority by tolerating conduct which is not per se incompatible with the values of a democratic society or wholly outside the norms of conduct of such a society, far from creating unjust inequalities or discrimination, ensures cohesive and stable pluralism and promotes harmony and tolerance in society (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan v.

Every time a State intends to rely on the principle of “a democracy capable of defending itself” in order to justify interference with individual rights, it must carefully evaluate the scope and consequences of the measure under consideration, to ensure that the aforementioned balance is achieved (see Ždanoka v.

While the European Convention on Nationality has not been widely ratified by the Council of Europe member States (see paragraph 39 above), as noted in its Explanatory Report, its definition relies on the traditional understanding of a bond of nationality as expressed by the ICJ in the Nottebohm Case (see paragraphs 40 - 41 above). The choice of the criteria for the purposes of a naturalisation procedure is not, in principle, subject to any particular rules of international law and the States are free to decide on individual naturalisation (see paragraph 38 above). In certain situations, however, the States ’ discretion may be limited by the principle of non-intervention, according to which a State is prohibited from interfering in the internal or foreign affairs of another State (see Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nicaragua v. United States of America ), Merits, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, paragraphs 202 ‑ 05). Nevertheless, such limitation cannot be considered of any relevance for the purposes of the present case."

            [
                "81. In this connection the applicant advanced two arguments to claim that the State ’ s discretion was not completely unfettered in matters relating to the granting of nationality. Firstly, he referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. However, as the Court has already noted above, under the Convention there is no “right to nationality” similar to that in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (see paragraph 73 above). The applicant ’ s reference to the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights is likewise misguided, since the American Convention on Human Rights, which is a regional instrument, explicitly provides for a right to nationality in its Article 20 (see paragraphs 43-45 above)."
            ],
            [
                "82. The applicant ’ s second argument was that the State ’ s discretion was limited by the obligation to reduce statelessness. The Court observes that the applicant belongs to a category of Latvian residents who were granted a specific civil status under domestic law – “permanently resident non-citizens” ( nepilsoņi ) – that is, citizens of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics who lost their Soviet citizenship following its dissolution but, while being so entitled, have not subsequently obtained any other nationality (see, for more details relating to categories of Latvian residents, Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, §§ 50-53, ECHR 2003-X, and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, §§ 46-47, ECHR 2007-I ). The applicant has not shown how the availability or not of a given status in domestic law would have affected his exercise of freedom of expression and of assembly."
            ],
            [
                "83. Turning now to the Convention system, the Court reiterates that in some circumstances it has ruled that arbitrary or discriminatory decisions in the field of nationality may raise issues in human rights law in general and under the Convention specifically (see the above-cited cases of Karassev; Riener, § 153; and Genovese, § 34). However, as noted above, neither the Convention nor international law in general provides for the right to acquire a specific nationality. The applicant has accepted this. The Court observes that there is nothing in the Latvian Citizenship Law to indicate that the applicant could unconditionally claim a right to Latvian citizenship (see paragraphs 20, 29 and 63 above) or that the negative decision of the Cabinet of Ministers could be seen as an arbitrary denial of such citizenship (contrast Genovese, cited above, § 34)."
            ],
            [
                "84. The issue whether or not the applicant has an arguable right to acquire citizenship of a State must in principle be resolved by reference to the domestic law of that State (see Kolosovskiy v. Latvia ( dec. ), no. 50183/99, 29 January 2004). Similarly, the question whether a person was denied a State ’ s citizenship arbitrarily in a manner that might raise an issue under the Convention is to be determined with reference to the terms of the domestic law (see Fehér and Dolník v. Slovakia ( dec. ), nos. 14927/12 and 30415/12, § 41, 21 May 2013). The choice of criteria for the purposes of granting citizenship through naturalisation in accordance with domestic law is linked to the nature of the bond between the State and the individual concerned that each society deems necessary to ensure. In many jurisdictions, acquisition of citizenship is accompanied by an oath of allegiance whereby the individual pledges loyalty to the State. The Court has addressed the issue of loyalty, albeit in a slightly different context of electoral rights, and drawn a distinction between loyalty to the State and loyalty to the government (see Tănase, cited above, § 166)."
            ],
            [
                "85. The Court notes that the assessment of loyalty for the purposes of the naturalisation decision in the present case does not refer to loyalty to the government in power, but rather to the State and its Constitution. The Court considers that a democratic State is entitled to require persons who wish to acquire its citizenship to be loyal to the State and, in particular, to the constitutional principles on which it is founded. The applicant did not contest this. The Court agrees with the applicant that, in exercising his freedom of expression and of assembly, he is free to disagree with government policies as long as that critique takes place in accordance with the law; it is also true that the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. However, this is an entirely different matter from the issue of the criteria laid down for naturalisation and the corresponding procedure, which are both determined by domestic law. The requirement of loyalty to the State and its Constitution cannot be regarded as a punitive measure capable of interfering with freedom of expression and of assembly. Rather, it is a criterion which has to be fulfilled by any person seeking to obtain Latvian citizenship through naturalisation."

Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 38-42, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII ). The Court also reiterates that the Contracting States can impose limitations on holding a demonstration in a given place for public security reasons (see Disk and Kesk v. Turkey, no. 38676/08, § 29, 27 November 2012). Nevertheless, although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (ibid.)."

Russia, no. 4493/04, § 96, 25 October 2007). At the same time, the standard of “speediness” is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 § 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are not so much concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid. ).",

Having regard to the above findings, the Court also held, under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, that while the ensuing period of detention had been carried out on the order of a judge who was in principle competent to take the decision in issue, the judge had exercised his authority in manifest opposition to the procedural guarantees provided for by the Convention.

The accused ’ s right to a public hearing is not only an additional guarantee that an endeavour will be made to establish the truth but also helps to ensure that he is satisfied that his case is being determined by a tribunal whose independence and impartiality he may verify. The public character of proceedings before judicial bodies protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts, superior and inferior, can be maintained.

At the same time, it is noted that the administrative offence record indicates that the applicant committed the offence under Article 19.3 of the CAO because she held a non-authorised demonstration. By a court decision the applicant was found liable for “non-compliance with a lawful order by a police officer”. In describing the circumstances of the offence the court stated that the applicant had failed to end an unlawful demonstration and to comply with a lawful order by police officers (to show an identity document and to follow the police to the police station)."

Having regard to the context of the present case, the dispersal of the demonstration, the findings made by the domestic authorities and the penalty imposed on the applicant, the Court considers that the relevant facts disclose an interference which was sufficiently linked to the applicant ’ s exercise of her right to freedom of peaceful assembly under Article 11 of the Convention, considered in conjunction with her freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.",

The parties disagreed as to whether the interference was prescribed by law and served a legitimate aim. However, the Court decides to dispense with ruling on the issue of lawfulness because, in any event, the interference fell short of being necessary in a democratic society, for the reasons set out below (see, for a similar approach, Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that the expression “necessary in a democratic society” in Article 10 § 2 or 11 § 2 of the Convention implies that the interference corresponds to a “pressing social need” and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Court also notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 or 11 § 2 is not synonymous with “indispensable”, it remains for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of “necessity” in this context (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24). When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 or 11 the decisions that they delivered. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine, after having established that it pursued a “legitimate aim”, whether it was proportionate to that aim and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I)."

In fact, both the findings of the national courts and the Government ’ s observations before the Court contain contradictory submissions as to the nature of the actions held against the applicant in the administrative offence proceedings (see paragraphs 35, 39, 42 and 123 - 125 above). The arrest record referred to the alleged refusal to comply with orders given by the police (Article 19.3 of the CAO) whereas the administrative offence record indicated that the applicant had committed the offence under Article 19.3 of the CAO because she held a non-authorised demonstration. As already mentioned, the court described the circumstances of the offence stating that the applicant had failed to end an unlawful demonstration and to comply with a lawful order by police officers (to show an identity document and to follow the police to the police station). As stated above in the context of Article 6 of the Convention, for its part, the appeal court found it pertinent to amend the description of the circumstances, stating that the applicant had held an unlawful demonstration and held a banner containing a very negative assessment of the professional activity of high-ranking public officials. It was also noted in the appeal decision that the applicant had refused to comply with lawful orders to end the violation of the public order and threatened police officers with prosecution, thereby committing the offence of resisting a lawful order by the police."

As to the first ground, it is noted that the domestic decisions do not contain any clear findings that, as suggested by the respondent Government before the Court, the applicant had breached the requirements of the Public Gatherings Act, for instance on account of the notification by telegram, her alleged omission to provide sufficient contact details, or whether the demonstration had indeed taken place in the area expressly prohibited by section 8 of the Act, that is, in the “immediate vicinity” of “court buildings”. The appeal court merely mentioned this provision, without drawing any conclusions relating to the circumstance of the applicant ’ s case under Article 19.3 of the CAO (see paragraph 42 above). Nor do the domestic decisions contain any findings that the above alleged breaches justified the dispersal of the demonstration. While these issues were relevant, the courts did not take any clear stance on them in the administrative offence proceedings."

Therefore, the Government ’ s arguments concerning the alleged non-compliance with the notification requirements of the Public Gatherings Act cannot weigh in the Court ’ s proportionality analysis in the present case (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III, and Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012 ). In any event, the Court reiterates that there may be circumstances in which the formal unlawfulness of a peaceful public assembly is not sufficient to justify its dispersal (see Bukta and Others, cited above, §§ 35-36, and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 38-42, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII ). The Court also reiterates that the Contracting States can impose limitations on holding a demonstration in a given place for public security reasons (see Disk and Kesk v. Turkey, no. 38676/08, § 29, 27 November 2012). Nevertheless, although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (ibid.)."

For the Court, it is difficult to conceive that such an event could have generated the gathering of a significant crowd warranting specific (for instance, security) measures on the side of the authorities. Also, it is not without interest that the proceedings against the other two participants in the demonstration were discontinued, inter alia, because no related violations were established."

Furthermore, the Court cannot deal with the Government ’ s argument suggesting that the demonstration had to be dispersed in order to put an end to unsubstantiated accusations in respect of judges and in order to protect their reputation and honour. This justification was never mentioned in the domestic proceedings and did not justify the interference with the applicant ’ s rights."

As to the second ground mentioned in paragraph 134 above, even accepting that the applicant had indeed failed to comply with a lawful order concerning her identity document, the national authorities themselves linked, in practice, the administrative case against the applicant to her exercise of her freedom of assembly. In that context, it had to be convincingly shown that the immediate dispersal of the peaceful demonstration (which is presumed to be lawful for the reasons stated above) and the applicant ’ s arrest and prosecution were necessary."

The domestic courts did not assess this issue in any noticeable way.

The applicants ’ names were not mentioned in the list of organisers of the demonstration. The principal aims of the demonstration were to criticise the work of the head of the local administration, Mr A., to denounce corruption and the misuse of public funds by the local administration, and to draw attention to the inactivity of the law-enforcement agencies vis-à-vis abuses committed by Mr A. and his colleagues.

He further explained that at some time after 10 a. m. on 25 April 2006, his men had stopped a large group of protesters who had been trying to enter Usukhchay. Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

Although subsequently the charges against two of them were dropped for want of sufficiently strong incriminating evidence, this fact alone does not mean that the original suspicion was not “reasonable” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c). There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202).

His allegation that he had been arrested in order to prevent him from participating in the demonstration of 25 April 2006 has no support in the materials of the case. In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v.

The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

The Court reiterates its finding above that the first and the third applicants had not been amongst the organisers of the demonstration and hence had no standing to complain about the decision of 17 April 2006 as such. That being said, in assessing the events of 25 April 2006 and the actions of the police on that day the Court cannot disregard the reasons adduced by the district administration in the decision of 17 April 2006. After all, when on 25 April 2006 the police blocked the village of Usukhchay, it did so in order to implement the decision of 17 April 2006 and prevent the unauthorised gathering. Therefore, the Court will start its analysis of the events of 25 April 2006 with the examination of the reasons adduced by Mr A. ’ s, the head of the district administration, in his decision of 17 April 2006.",

                "121. The Court recalls that Article 11 establishes a three-tier test: an interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims. A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration. The Court has to analyse each of them, by applying the three-tier test, in order to see whether any of those objections could have justified the banning of the demonstration."
            ],
            [
                "122. First, Mr A. argued that the notice was lodged outside of the time ‑ limit set by the Public Gatherings Act. On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."
            ],
            [
                "123. The present case raises two questions related to the “duty of notification”. First, the parties disagreed as to whether the organisers had submitted the notice within the time-limits provided for in the Public Gatherings Act. Secondly, even if they did not comply with the time-limits, the question is whether their failure to do so was by itself sufficient to make the upcoming event “unlawful” and what legal consequences it should have entailed."
            ],
            [
                "124. On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."
            ],
            [
                "126. Next, the Court notes that the law provided for a very short time ‑ slot when the notification could have been “lodged”. Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."
            ],
            [
                "127. The Court also notes that the delay in “lodging” the notice, if any, was insignificant. Mr A. decided not to allow the demonstration on the same day the notice was received. From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

                "128. In the Court ’ s opinion, in the circumstances Mr A. ’ s refusal to allow the demonstration with reference to the allegedly belated “lodging” of the notice did not have a firm basis in the domestic law and was, in addition, not sufficient to justify the interference complained of.",

                "129. The second reason for the refusal to allow the demonstration was the allegedly insufficient capacity of the park. The first and the third applicants did not argue that Mr A. was wrong in his assessment of the capacity, and there is nothing in the case materials to refute his assessment. In such circumstances, the Court is prepared to accept that the park was, indeed, too small to host all the demonstrators."
            ],
            [
                "130. In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the domestic law permitted the authorities to regulate the manner, timing and location of public events, depending on the characteristics of the specific area at issue."
            ],
            [
                "131. That being said, the Court does not consider that the size of the park was sufficient reason for a total ban on the demonstration. The situation in the present case is comparable to that in the case of Barankevich v. Russia ( no. 10519/03, § 33, 26 July 2007 ), where the Court found that “instead of considering measures which could have allowed the ... assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of ... assembly ”. The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers. However, the head of the district administration decided to take the “most radical measure”. Thus, a fair balance between the legitimate aim and the means for attaining it was not attained.",

Thus, in his reply to the organisers ’ written notice, Mr A. stated that all allegations of corruption, embezzlement and tampering with official records were false and had been refuted by numerous official investigations and audits."
            ],
            [
                "133. The Court is not aware of the details of the local political debate and does not need to assess the veracity of the accusations; it is sufficient to note that the demonstrators ’ “message” undeniably concerned a serious matter of public concern and related to the sphere of political debate. Furthermore, it is clear that the accusations against the district administration officials related to some factual circumstances which had already given rise to a number of domestic inquiries."
            ],
            [
                "134. The Court reiterates that it has been its constant approach, under Article 10, to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political speech or serious matters of public interest (see, with necessary changes made, Karman v. Russia, no. 29372/02, § 36, 14 December 2006; Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001- VIII; and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV)."
            ],
            [
                "135. The approach under Article 11 must be the same: public events related to political life in the country or at the local level must enjoy strong protection under that provision, and rare are the situations where a gathering may be legitimately banned in relation to the substance of the message which its participants wish to convey. The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong. It is especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering, as in the case at hand. Content-based restrictions on the freedom of assembly should be subjected to the most serious scrutiny by this Court, and in the present case the Government did not forward any convincing argument which would justify such a restriction."

The above finding, however important it may be, does not suffice to conclude that all subsequent actions of the police on 25 April 2006 were automatically contrary to the Convention. In many cases the dispersal of a demonstration can be regarded as a direct consequence of the authorities ’ decision not to allow it, but in the present case the Court considers that the dispersal must be examined in its own right. Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments. The situation in the present case evolved very quickly, and the actions of the police must be assessed not only in the light of the decision of 17 April 2006 but also taking into account the situation as it stood on 2 5 April 2006."

The dividing line between them lies at around 1 p.m., when the demonstrators, including the first and third applicants, approached the village of Miskindzha and blocked the federal road with stones and other objects. The first phase, which took place in or near Usukhchay village, was relatively peaceful, whereas the second phase, which took place on the federal road near Miskindzha, culminated in a clash between the forces of order and the protesters. The Court will first assess the first phase of the demonstration, namely the events of the morning of 25 April 2006. The central question is whether any new circumstances, not mentioned in the decision of 17 April 2006, could have justified the actions of the authorities, and, in particular, the blockade of the village by the police.",

The Court ’ s approach to the establishment of the facts depends on a number of factors. One is the character of the complaint made under the Convention. The Court observes that, as a result of the dispersal of the demonstration, some of the protesters were seriously wounded and one, Mr Ng ., died. As follows from the intermediate conclusions of the criminal investigation ( case no. 668459 ), the casualties were in part explained by the fact that unidentified police officers did not respect the instructions and fired tear ‑ gas grenades directly at the crowd."

However, in the present case the Court has not received complaints from those who were wounded during the dispersal of the demonstration or from the relatives of the late Mr Il.

The first reason was invoked by the district authorities during the negotiations with the leaders of the demonstration in the morning of 25 April 2006: they claimed that if a considerable number of people were to gather near the premises of the district administration, the crowd would risk blocking the main road adjacent to the square."

Although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (see Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116- 1 17, and Bukta and Others, cited above, § 37).

Thus, the alternative proposal made by the administration was, in the Court ’ s opinion, inappropriate ( contrast with Berladir and Others, cited above, § 56).

Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 40, 24 July 2012, with further references). In the same case the Court analysed the existence of a “ demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance” ( § 47).

Although the link between the two incidents – of 19 April and of 25 April 2006 – is not entirely clear, the relation between those incidents cannot be ruled out. It follows that the authorities ’ forecast as to the possible scenario for the demonstration of 25 April 2006 was not groundless, and was based on a very recent episode. Furthermore, the intensity of violence on 19 April 2006 was not insignificant.

The demonstration was originally intended to be peaceful. At least, it was so stated by the organisers in the notice sent to the district administration on 10 April 2006. The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons. The behaviour of the demonstrators in the morning of 25 April 2006 was non ‑ violent as well. The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40). Furthermore, it was not disputed that despite the dispatch of over 180 policemen to the area the police were seriously outnumbered."

                "160. The Court cannot exclude that the authorities may have been partly responsible for what happened on the road near Miskindzha. Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

Moreover, there is no strong evidence that the first and third applicants were personally involved in any violent act: thus, although the first applicant was originally suspected of having incited the protesters to block the road and oppose the police “with the use of firearms”, the accusations against him were finally dropped. As to the third applicant, he has never been suspected of any violent behaviour during the events of 25 April 2006; his arrest and subsequent prosecution were related to his role in the incident of 19 April 2006 near Kamsumkent and Khiv."

A considerable number of demonstrators overstepped the boundary of peaceful protest, attacked policemen with stones, sticks, rods and knives and seriously injured some of them (see paragraph 66 above ). Against this background, the use of the special equipment and even firearms by the police does not seem to be unjustified. Even if some of the police officers acted unprofessionally and in defiance of the rules on the use of gas grenade launchers (ibid. ), there is no evidence that the firearms had been used deliberately to kill or to wound the protesters."

                "164. Finally, the Court turns to the first applicant ’ s complaint about his arrest on 29 April 2006. This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. In this respect, they first contended that the applicant had not raised his grievance under Article 11 before the domestic authorities.

Taking into account the provisions of Law no. 6459, on 20 June 2013 the Adana Assize Court also suspended the execution of the prison sentence he had been given following his criminal conviction under Article 314 of the Criminal Code, and later on 5 November 2013 quashed that criminal conviction."

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

                "46. The Court notes that it has already examined an almost identical grievance in the case of Işıkırık v. Turkey ( cited above, §§ 55-70) and found a breach of Article 11 of the Convention. In that case, having examined the application of Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code alone and in connection with Article 220 § 6 of the same Code, the Court firstly found that when applied in connection with Article 220 § 6, the criteria for a conviction under Article 314 § 2 were extensively applied to the detriment of the applicant ( ibid., § 66). It also observed that the array of acts that potentially constituted a basis for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code, were so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, did not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (ibid., § 67). The Court further observed that on account of Mr Işıkırık ’ s conviction, for acts which fell within the scope of Article 11 of Convention, there remained no distinction between him, a peaceful demonstrator, and an individual who had committed offences within the structure of the PKK. For the Court, such an extensive interpretation of a legal norm could not be justified when it had the effect of equating mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. It considered that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and, thereby, the foundations of a democratic society, had been undermined when Mr Işıkırık had been held criminally liable under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code for the mere fact of attending a public meeting and expressing his views therein (ibid., § 68). Noting that when demonstrators faced the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risked an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, the Court found that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on those who were found criminally liable on re ‑ exercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, the provision in question would also have a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (ibid., § 69). The Court as a result concluded that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code had not been “foreseeable” in its application since it did not afford the applicant the legal protection against arbitrary interference with his right under Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., § 70)."

She further submitted that, in the period following the 2003 presidential election, both the police and the courts were acting upon the instructions of the authorities and doing all that was possible to punish the opposition activists in conditions lacking transparency. The police as a rule were looking for their “victims” not at a demonstration but at a later hour and at a different location. Often the public and close relatives became aware of the conviction only after the court decision had been taken and the convicted person had already been placed in the detention facility. The accused were normally not ill-treated at police stations but were, nevertheless, subjected to various methods of psychological pressure aimed at forcing them to sign documents containing false accusations. In order to conceal the fact that these cases were fabricated, the authorities were not allowing lawyers to participate and were holding hearings at late hours, thus effectively excluding the possibility for them to be public."

The actions which led to a penalty being imposed on the applicant, according to the judge’s findings, were the “obstruction of street traffic” and the “loud noise” she made during this demonstration which, in the Court’s opinion, were the direct result of her participation in it.

Furthermore, the authorities never attempted to disperse the demonstration or to order its participants, including the applicant, to leave on account of it being illegal or unauthorised or obstructing traffic (ibid., § 101). It is true that, in the present case, the police report stated that the applicant had participated in an unauthorised march heading from the Research Institute towards the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 10 above). However, first of all, this allegation was not confirmed in the course of the court proceedings since the applicant was not convicted for her participation in an allegedly unauthorised march, but for certain actions committed at the demonstration on the Mashtots Avenue located in front of the Research Institute (see paragraph 17 above). Secondly, it is not clear on what grounds such an allegation was made by the reporting police officer taking into account that at the material time there was no legal act applicable in Armenia containing rules for organising and holding rallies and street marches, including the rules for authorising such events (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, § 43, 11 January 2007). The Court further notes that the Government did not allege that the demonstration was unauthorised or unlawful either. There is therefore nothing in the materials of the present case that would prompt the Court to depart from the findings made in the case of Galstyan.

When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction’s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

Furthermore, any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, and where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman v.

It has been further established that the street traffic was suspended beforehand by the traffic police with the intention of facilitating the conduct of the demonstration and the authorities did not make any attempts at any point to disperse the demonstration on account of unlawful obstruction of traffic (ibid., § 116). The Court notes that there is nothing in the materials of the present case that would prompt it to depart from these findings. It follows that the “obstruction of street traffic”, which the applicant was found guilty of, similarly amounted to her physical presence at the demonstration. As to the loud noise made by the applicant, there is similarly no suggestion that this noise involved any obscenity or incitement to violence.

No further details of these allegations were provided, such as the actual obscenities involved, who they were addressed at and in which circumstances, the manner in which the applicant had allegedly used any violence and whether anybody had been injured. No evidence was taken from any victims or witnesses, other than the arresting police officers, and these findings were made following a trial which lasted not more than five minutes. The Court further notes that the materials of the applicant’s administrative case contain no further factual details either. The charge against her simply stated that she had “made a loud noise with a group of people, and randomly insulted and hit passers-by” and even the police report did not provide any substantial details of the applicant’s allegedly reprehensible behaviour. In spite of this, these materials were relied upon by the domestic court when convicting the applicant, while her submissions made in court in her defence did not find any reflection in the court’s findings.

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among numerous authorities, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 114, 15 November 2007 ). This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. The essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no. 11002/05, § 37, 27 February 2007 ). Accordingly, where the State does intervene, such interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims."

When the applicant approached the exit a big group of policemen rushed over to block his way and there had been a minute ’ s pause when a crowd began to build up against the cordon, blocking the passage. Then one person was arrested, and about thirty seconds later someone else, and then the applicant. T. saw the applicant ’ s arrest as he was filming it from a distance of about five or six metres. He was separated from the applicant by several rows of people, of which two rows consisted of policemen. The recording began a few minutes before the arrest and continued without any interruption until the applicant had been put in the police van. He specified that the applicant had not put up any resistance to the officers arresting him. He identified on the photograph the officer wearing a fur hat, who had arrested the applicant, and explained that that person had taken the applicant out of the crowd and then passed him on to another policeman in order to put the applicant into the police van. He also stated that the applicant had not shouted any slogans or insults. The applicant had repeated “ Easy, easy” to the policemen while being escorted to the van.

A policeman addresses the citizens through a loudspeaker with a request to disperse and not to block the passage, but Mr Nemtsov remains standing in one place addressing the gathered citizens. The video operator is at such a distance from the applicant that he is separated from him by several rows of people, including the gathered citizens and the riot police, and it is impossible to understand what these citizens and the applicant are saying. Subsequently the recording of the applicant is interrupted as the camera points away onto the policemen putting the first arrested person, and then another one, into the police vans.

From about 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. the applicant took part in an authorised and peaceful public demonstration at Triumfalnaya Square. The place designated for the meeting was cordoned off by the riot police, and the only exit from the meeting was at Tverskaya Street; the exit was heavily guarded by the riot police. During the meeting the applicant addressed the participants with a speech expressing strong political views that could have been seen by the officials as controversial and even provocative. Having finished his speech he headed towards the exit, accompanied by his daughter and her friend. The applicant was arrested at the exit to Tverskaya Street before he could leave the restricted area. The time between the moment when the applicant, his daughter and her friend reached the police cordon in front of the exit to Tverskaya Street and the applicant ’ s arrest did not exceed one or two minutes. This time-frame, stated by the applicant ’ s daughter and her friend at the trial and not challenged at any stage, appears to constitute common ground between the parties.

It follows from the witness testimonies that the people gathered at the cordon were the participants of the authorised meeting who were willing but unable to leave the restricted area. The official account also sits at odds with the time-frame established above, as such a sequence of actions and the arrest would have had to have been carried out within one or two minutes.

On the basis of all evidence submitted by the parties it finds that the applicant had arrived at the police cordon and found himself in a crowd of people willing to leave the meeting but unable to do so because the exit had been blocked or narrowed down by the riot police.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. The essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no. 11002/05, § 37, 27 February 2007 ).

The Court notes that the legal basis for the applicant ’ s arrest and the subsequent administrative charges brought against him was Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, which prescribed an administrative penalty for disobeying the lawful orders of a police officer. However, the reference to this provision was contested by the applicant on the grounds that the underlying events had not, in fact, taken place, and the Court has upheld this view (see paragraph 71 above). In particular, it has found above that the authorities had not proven that the applicant had received an order from the police, or that it was lawful, or that the applicant had disobeyed it (ibid.). On the contrary, it found that the applicant had arrived at the police cordon and was arrested after having shouted out that Article 31 of the Constitution guaranteed freedom of assembly, without having received any orders or having disobeyed them. The Court therefore concludes that the arrest and the ensuing administrative liability were imposed on the applicant without any connection with the intended purpose of the legal provision for disobeying lawful orders of the police. The interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107)."

An order to stop those actions – had they truly occurred – required strong justification in order to be lawful. The courts dispensed with those considerations. The administrative proceedings against the applicant and his ensuing detention had the effect of discouraging him from participating in protest rallies or indeed from engaging actively in opposition politics."

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case ‑ by ‑ case basis.

In this connection, mere mistakes are to be distinguished from a flagrant denial of justice undermining not only the fairness of a person ’ s trial, but also the lawfulness of the ensuing detention. According to the Court ’ s case-law, detention following a conviction imposed in manifestly unfair proceedings amounting to a flagrant denial of justice is unlawful and automatically implies a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Stoichkov v.

Austria, 21 June 1988, § 32, Series A no. 139 ).

As a preliminary point, the Court considers that these principles are also applicable with regard to demonstrations and processions organised in public areas ( see Djavit An, cited above, § 56). It notes, however, that it is not contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a priori, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation and regulates the activities of associations ( see Djavit An, cited above, §§ 66 ‑ 67 )."

Having regard to the domestic legislation, the Court observes that no authorisation is required for the holding of public demonstrations; at the material time, however, notification was required seventy-two hours prior to the event. In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as it is protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility; this being so, it is important that associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force."

However, it points out that an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III). In the instant case, however, notification would have enabled the authorities to take the necessary measures in order to minimise the disruption to traffic that the demonstration could have caused during rush hour. In the Court ’ s opinion, it is important that preventive security measures such as, for example, the presence of first-aid services at the site of demonstrations, be taken in order to guarantee the smooth conduct of any event, meeting or other gathering, be it political, cultural or of another nature."

Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court notes that criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicants based on the fact that they had shouted slogans in support of an armed, illegal organisation. Although all four of the applicants were convicted as charged and each was sentenced to three years and six months'imprisonment, following recent amendments in the criminal law system the proceedings were reopened and are still pending in respect of two of the applicants, Mr Ercan Gül and Mr Erkan Arslanbenzer. As a result, although there is no final conviction in respect of two of the applicants, having regard to the fact that all of the applicants were found guilty under Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and that the criminal proceedings which were initially commenced in 1999 have not yet been terminated, there has been an interference with the applicants'right to freedom of expression. The Court further notes that the interference was prescribed by law, namely Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and Section 7 § 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act on disseminating the propaganda of an illegal, armed organisation through incitement to use violent methods. As to the legitimacy of the aims pursued, the Court observes that the authorities sought to protect national security and public order.

The law also applies to those who, despite being aware of the aims pursued by the terrorist organisation, provided shelter, food, weapons, ammunition or any other kind of assistance. An important feature of the rehabilitation law is that it provides the possibility of reducing the sentences of those who wish to take advantage of the law by providing relevant information and documents on the structure and activities of the terrorist organisation.",

Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court notes that criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicants based on the fact that they had shouted slogans in support of an armed, illegal organisation. Although all four of the applicants were convicted as charged and each was sentenced to three years and six months'imprisonment, following recent amendments in the criminal law system the proceedings were reopened and are still pending in respect of two of the applicants, Mr Ercan Gül and Mr Erkan Arslanbenzer. As a result, although there is no final conviction in respect of two of the applicants, having regard to the fact that all of the applicants were found guilty under Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and that the criminal proceedings which were initially commenced in 1999 have not yet been terminated, there has been an interference with the applicants'right to freedom of expression. The Court further notes that the interference was prescribed by law, namely Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and Section 7 § 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act on disseminating the propaganda of an illegal, armed organisation through incitement to use violent methods. As to the legitimacy of the aims pursued, the Court observes that the authorities sought to protect national security and public order. It therefore remains to be determined whether the interference complained of was “necessary in a democratic society”."

France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999-I). Furthermore, the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, Yarar v.

In this connection, it must, with due regard to the circumstances of each case and the State's margin of appreciation, ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the individual's fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic society's legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organisations (see Zana, cited above, § 55)."

The Court observes that, taken literally, some of the slogans shouted (such as “Political power grows out of the barrel of the gun”, “It is the barrel of the gun that will call into account”) had a violent tone (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that these are well-known, stereotyped leftist slogans and that they were shouted during lawful demonstrations – which limited their potential impact on “national security” and “public order” – they cannot be interpreted as a call for violence or an uprising. The Court stresses, however, that whilst this assessment should not be taken as an approval of the tone of these slogans, it must be recalled that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, Karataş v. Turkey [GC], no. 23168/94, § 49, ECHR 19 99 ‑ IV). The Court also reiterates that, according to its well-established case-law, paragraph 2 of Article 10, is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” which are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see, Sürek and Özdemir v.

In the latter case, the slogan shouted by the applicant had clearly amounted to an apology for terrorism and, furthermore, at the end of the proceedings, he was sentenced to twenty - five days'imprisonment. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with freedom of expression (see Yarar v. Turkey, no. 57258/00, § 41, 19 December 2006 ). In the instant case the Court notes that although, following recent amendments in domestic legislation, the criminal proceedings against the applicants were re - opened, initially all of the applicants had been sentenced to three years and nine months'imprisonment. However, the Court finds that this sentence and the lengthy criminal proceedings were disproportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Koç and Tambaş v. Turkey, no. 50934/99, § 39, 21 March 2006)."

XXXVI of 2013 on Electoral Procedure, and Article 2 § 1 of the Fundamental Law. Relying on previous Guidelines issued in 2014, it held that voters could not treat ballot papers as their own [property], and therefore could neither take them out of the polling booths nor take a photograph of them. It held that taking photographs of ballot papers could lead to electoral fraud. Furthermore, although the principle of secrecy did not create any obligation on the voters’ side, it nevertheless did not entitle them to abuse their situation, bearing in mind that voting secrecy could be maintained only with their cooperation.

The decision contained the following passages:",
                "The petitioner has lodged a petition for review of the decision of the National Election Commission, requesting that the decision be set aside and the complaint be overturned. In its view, the decision violates Articles 2 § 1 and IX § 1 of the Fundamental Law and section 2(1)(e) of the Electoral Procedure Act.",
                "The petitioner pointed out that it was for the complainant to prove that the application was illegal, and that since he had failed to do so, the complaint should have been rejected without examination on the merits. The NEC did not examine the application, basing its findings on press releases. The petitioner attached the application on an external device and argued that neither it nor the developer of the application could have access to the personal data of the users; the data transferred could not be linked to a user and therefore did not constitute personal data. The Guidelines [of the National Election Commission] did not have binding force and could not constitute a legal basis for the decision. According to the petitioner’s reasoning, its conduct in providing publicity for the application and calling on voters to use the application fell on the one hand within the sphere of protection of freedom of expression, and on the other hand called on voters to exercise their right to freedom of expression, protected by Article IX § 1 of the Fundamental Law. The right to freedom of expression was not an unlimited fundamental right. However, regard being had to a number of Constitutional Court judgments, it could only be restricted in so far as necessary and proportionate in relation to another fundamental right or constitutional principle, and any restriction should be capable of achieving the stated aim. The secrecy of the vote had not been infringed by the application since the content of the vote could not be linked to the voter. The secrecy of the vote entailed the right for voters to ensure that no one could gain knowledge of how they had voted, but it did not create an obligation for voters not to share details of their vote with others. Irrespective of the above, the application, which provided a forum for voters to share the content of their vote with others, was incapable of infringing the secrecy of the vote. Therefore, in the petitioner’s view, the application did not infringe Article 2 § 1 of the Fundamental Law or section 2(1)(a) and (e) of the Electoral Procedure Act. ...",

The subject-matter of the review is the decision of the NEC coming within the scope of the petition for review, that is, the decision finding that calling on voters to upload and publish photographs of ballot papers from the national referendum on a mobile application infringed the secrecy of voting, the fairness of the voting and the bona fide exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose.",
                "The complainant attached to his complaint as evidence the information about the application published on the petitioner’s website and on the websites hvg.hu and index.hu. The reviewing court thus finds that the complainant fulfilled his obligation to adduce the requisite evidence in support of his complaint. The NEC adequately clarified the underlying facts, and did not violate section 43(1) of the Electoral Procedure Act.",
                "The Kúria emphasises at the outset that the Guidelines do not constitute a legislative act and do not have binding legal force under section 51(2) of the Electoral Procedure Act; thus, they are irrelevant for the legal assessment of the present case. Although the NEC relied on the Guidelines in taking its decision, the latter should be assessed on its own, applying the relevant provisions of the Fundamental Law and the Electoral Procedure Act to the facts of the present case.",
                "Pursuant to Article 2 § 1 of the Fundamental Law, Members of the National Assembly are elected by universal and equal suffrage in a direct and secret ballot, in elections which guarantee the free expression of the will of the voters in a manner laid down in a cardinal Act. In the view of the reviewing court, the secrecy of voting (voting rights) as regulated by Article 2 § 1 means, firstly, that the right of all voters to a secret vote – not detectable by anybody –- must be secured. Secondly, a system must be developed that does not make it possible to establish how a voter has cast his or her ballot. The Kúria does not agree with the reasoning of the impugned decision according to which the application and its functions – and in particular the uploading of photographs, the sending of messages, the participation in voting, and the sending of notifications by voters – were openly aimed at infringing the secrecy of the vote and the referendum. The provisions of the Act on Initiating Referenda, the European Citizens’ Initiative and the Referendum Procedure, and of the Electoral Procedure Act, as well as the procedural rules on voting, clearly ensure that voters cast a secret ballot. The application attached to the present petition does not allow access to the personal data of the users, and is thus incapable of linking a cast ballot to a voter. The NEC reached the same conclusion. In the light of the above, the secrecy of the ballot was not infringed by the application or by the use thereof, and the NEC’s decision to uphold the complaint in that respect was unlawful.",
                "According to section 2(1) of the Electoral Procedure Act, the following principles shall prevail in the application of the rules of electoral procedure:",
                "(a) the protection of the fairness of the election;",
                "(e) the exercise of rights in good faith and in accordance with their purpose.",
                "The provisions relevant to voting are contained in sections 168-186 of the Electoral Procedure Act. Under section 180(1) of the Act voters must be provided with a polling booth in which to mark their ballot papers. Under section 182(1), the voter must put the ballot paper in an envelope and place it in a ballot box. Section 186(1) states that a valid vote can be given only to the candidates or lists whose names are printed on the official ballot paper.",
                "In the Kúria’s opinion – contrary to the reasoning of the NEC – the taking of photographs of ballot papers in the polling booth does not infringe the secrecy of voting and elections. There is no legislative act that forbids the taking of such photographs and the NEC was likewise unable to name any such provision. As stated above, the exercise of secret voting is twofold, and the taking of photographs does not infringe the secrecy of ballots and does not allow a cast ballot to be linked to a voter.",
                "The next question to be decided in the present case is whether calling on voters to upload their ballot photographs to the application and managing that application infringed the secrecy of the ballot and the bona fide exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose. According to the established case-law set out in Kúria decision no. Kvk.IV.37.359/2014/2, the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose is an obligation emanating from the principle of civil law concerning the prohibition of abuse of rights, to be applied in the whole legal system. This means that rights are to be exercised by their holders in conformity with their aim and content. Only such exercise of rights is protected by law, where besides the formal entitlement the real content of the right can be recognised. Thus, an infringement of the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose amounts to more than establishing an infringement of rights: the intention to abuse the content of a legal institution under the guise of lawful conduct must be recognisable.",
                "The reviewing court attaches particular importance to the role and use of ballot papers in the electoral process. A ballot paper clearly serves the purpose of allowing voters to express their opinion on a question put to the vote; any use of ballot papers contrary to this purpose infringes the principle of the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose. Accordingly, the application in question and the petitioner’s conduct in calling on voters to take photographs and publish them through the application also constitute an infringement of that principle.",
                "Under Article IX § 1 of the Fundamental Law everyone has the right to freedom of expression. The Constitutional Court established in its decision no. 30/1992 (V.26) AB that the State may have recourse to the restriction of fundamental rights if the exercise of another fundamental right or freedom or the protection of any constitutional value cannot be achieved by other means. Thus, it is not enough that the restriction is imposed in order to protect another fundamental right or freedom or for any other constitutional aim; it is also necessary for the restriction to be proportionate, that is, for the importance of the intended aim and the gravity of the violation of the fundamental right to be in balance with each other. The legislature must choose the least restrictive measure that is adequate to achieve the intended aim. Any restriction of a right that does not serve a pressing need or is arbitrary, or any restriction that is disproportionate to the aim, will be unconstitutional.",
                "The reviewing court emphasises that its reasoning regarding the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose does not infringe voters’ right to freedom of expression. In the present case the right of voters to freedom of expression in the context of voting is twofold. Firstly, they express their opinion on the question put to a vote by casting their ballot; secondly, they have the option to share the way they have voted with others orally, in writing, or in any other way, for example on social media or other websites. The Kúria finds that the application is in breach of the principle of the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose not because it enables voters – without them being individually recognisable – to publicise the way they have voted, but rather because of the manner in which it enables them to publicise it, namely through the taking and uploading of ballot photographs.",
                "The petitioner’s conduct was therefore in breach of the exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose. However, the breach was not of a degree of gravity that would entail an infringement of the principle of protection of fair elections as set forth in section 2(1)(a) of the Electoral Procedure Act. The breach had no material impact on the fairness of the national referendum.",
                "The Kúria also examined whether the petitioner’s conduct infringed the principle of the bona fide exercise of rights. In this context it emphasises that developing the application and calling on voters to use it does not infringe the principle of the bona fide exercise of rights. No malicious intent of the petitioner has been proven and the decision of the NEC does not contain any substantive argument in this regard.",
                "The Kúria does not agree with the NEC’s reasoning according to which the application is particularly liable to shake people’s confidence in the IT and tallying system for voting. The NEC did not provide any substantive argument in this regard. Likewise, in the Kúria ’s view, there is no aspect of the application or of the call to voters to use the application that would be capable of shaking public confidence in the work of the electoral bodies. Taking ballot photographs does not enable electoral fraud.",

Since the Kúria had already found that the finding of unlawfulness in NEC decision no. 118/2016 was erroneous, no such unlawfulness could be established in the present case either. In the petitioner’s view, the method it used to express an opinion was not unlawful to an extent that would justify the imposition of a fine. The fact that it did not comply with NEC decision no. 118/2016 could not serve as the basis for a fine, since the decision was not final or legally binding.",

                "Based on the above, developing and providing voters with a mobile application encouraging them to cast an invalid ballot is likely to influence voters’ choice. Under section 140 of the Electoral Procedure Act, campaign material is any material that is likely to influence, or attempts to influence, voters’ choice; this is true also of the present mobile application. Under section 141 of the Electoral Procedure Act campaigning activity is any activity using campaign material during the campaign period, and any other activity likely to influence or attempting to influence voters’ choice during the campaign period. The NEC rightly established that the petitioner carried out campaigning activity during the campaign period as provided for in section 139 of the Electoral Procedure Act.",

It does not share the observation of the applicant in relation to campaign activities to the effect that in the present case no fine could be imposed for the manner in which an opinion had been expressed. The applicant in the present case was not fined solely because of the manner in which an opinion had been expressed. The campaigning activity had been carried out contrary to the principle of exercise of rights in accordance with their purpose as enshrined in section 2(1)(e) of the Electoral Procedure Act.

Nowadays, it is common for citizens to express their experiences, thoughts and opinions by sharing photographs taken with their mobile telephones on various websites (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, blogs). In the course of elections this manifests itself by citizens taking ballot photographs and sharing them with others on social media. In developing the application the complainant’s intention was to secure the possibility for voters to exercise their right to freedom of expression by anonymously sharing a photograph of their ballot papers (or, in the case of those who did not participate in the referendum, a photograph of the activity they were otherwise engaged in) and a related comment in a manner that did not allow the cast ballot to be linked to the voter him or herself. ...",

Given the features of social media, this type of photograph-sharing links the cast ballot with the voter, since the photograph appears under the name of the user. By contrast, the application in the present case explicitly provides a possibility for individuals to share ballot photographs, and the content of their vote, with others without revealing their identity; therefore it is even less liable to breach the secrecy of the ballot than photographs shared on Facebook or other social media. If the development and advertising of the application were declared unlawful, this would result in voters sharing their ballot photographs on social media in a manner linking them with their vote, which would increase rather than decrease the hypothetical likelihood of electoral fraud.”"

This constitutional obligation is not conditional on necessity and proportionality, but on the realisation of the purpose of the right in question. ... Besides the obligation to respect and protect fundamental rights, the enforcement of the election principles also serves the interests of legal certainty, originating from the principle of the rule of law under Article 2 § 1 of the Constitution.

It means that entitled persons may avail themselves of legal institutions only in a manner which is in compliance with the purpose and content of those institutions. Only when exercised in that way do rights enjoy statutory protection and recognition corresponding to the true content – and not only the formal conditions – of the entitlement. Section 2(2) of Act no. IV of 1959 on the Civil Code provides that ‘the law shall ensure that everybody can exercise his or her right in compliance with the societal purpose of the right’.",

The examples which are provided of an exercise of rights not in accordance with their purpose and of an abuse of rights imply that the exercise of a right not in accordance with its purpose can be established if it entails negative consequences (for instance, the restriction or infringement of the rights of others).",

The latter is a basic principle of the electoral procedure under the Electoral Procedure Act. Given that, under section 2, the rules of the Electoral Procedure Act are applicable to national referendums, the basic principles governing elections are also applicable to referendums. The basic principles governing elections are applicable throughout the whole electoral process and to all actors in the process ...

The Constitutional Court held that the permissible restrictions on the broadcast media (television and radio) were broader, firstly because of the lack of available frequencies and secondly because of their special impact on society and public opinion. The decision of the Kúria finding that an editor’s freedom could be restricted on the basis of the general principles of the Electoral Procedure Act was connected to the obligation to provide objective information. In its decision no. 1/2007 (I.18) the Constitutional Court established that the requirement to provide balanced, unbiased and objective information could constitute a restriction on the editorial freedom of the broadcast media, but that these restrictions were relevant only for the specific characteristics of the broadcast media and were not applicable to the printed media. As regards the printed media, the starting-point of the Constitutional Court has always been the unlimited freedom of founding a newspaper; accordingly, the power of the media to influence cannot serve as a ground for restriction. In this sense the printed media cannot be penalised because of the nature and quality of the information they provide.",

The Constitutional Court emphasises that this requires the State first and foremost to recognise editorial freedom and respect the prohibition of interference with media content.

Thus, if a voter treats a ballot paper as his or her own and takes it out of the polling station or takes a photograph of it before placing it in the envelope or dropping it in the ballot box, he or she infringes the principle of the bona fide exercise of voting rights in accordance with their purpose. Taking ballot papers out of the polling station, or taking photographs, videos, and so forth of them, can also result in electoral fraud, the prevention of which [furthers] the public interest in protecting the fairness of elections.",

The secrecy of elections also encompasses the secrecy of ballot papers; thus, taking photographs of voting or of ballot papers is in breach of the principles of the Electoral Procedure Act. Voting secrecy serves not only the safe expression of voters’ will but also the realisation of the voting procedure in accordance with the rule of law and the principles of democracy. Thus, its importance goes beyond the conduct of individual voters. Obviously, voting secrecy does not create an obligation of confidentiality on the part of voters, but the obligation to exercise rights in accordance with their purpose means that voters should not abuse the fact that voting secrecy can be only partially achieved without their cooperation.",

In its case-law the Court has established that Article 10 applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of dissemination, since any restriction imposed on the latter necessarily interferes with the right to receive and impart information (see, inter alia, Ahmet Yıldırım v. Turkey, no. 3111/10, § 50, ECHR 2012). In respect of the printed media, the Court has found that publishers, who do not necessarily associate themselves with the opinions expressed in the works they publish, participate in the exercise of freedom of expression by providing authors with a medium (see Öztürk v. Turkey [GC], no. 22479/93, § 49, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI). In the context of new media, the Court has previously held that a Google service designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of websites within a group constituted a means of exercising freedom of expression (see Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 49). Similarly, a video-hosting website represented an important means of exercising the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas. The blocking of these services was found to have deprived users of a significant means of exercising their right to freedom to receive and impart information and ideas (see Cengiz and Others v.

The Court sees no reason to call into question the domestic authorities’ interpretation of the MKKP’s conduct. It considers that the MKKP was seeking not only to provide a forum for voters to express their opinion, but also to convey a political message itself.

Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 120, ECHR 2015, with further references). The notion of “quality of the law” requires, as a corollary of the foreseeability test, that the law be compatible with the rule of law; it thus implies that there must be adequate safeguards in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82, and Olsson v.

As regards the requirement of foreseeability, the Court has repeatedly held that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable a person to regulate his or her conduct. That person must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. While certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Delfi AS, cited above, § 121, and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 141, ECHR 2012). The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference be laid down in the substantive law itself, and the requirement of “lawfulness” can be met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of substantive law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes (see Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-VIII). A law which confers a discretion is thus not in itself inconsistent with the requirement of foreseeability, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Gillow v. the United Kingdom, 24 November 1986, § 51, Series A no. 109)."

In this connection the Court reiterates that free speech is essential in ensuring “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”. For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds be permitted to circulate freely (see Orlovskaya Iskra v. Russia, no. 42911/08, § 110, 21 February 2017). This is especially true when the freedom of expression at stake is that of a political party. As the Court has repeatedly stated, political parties play an essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy. Restrictions on their freedom of expression therefore have to be made the subject of a rigorous supervision (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, §§ 87-88 and 100, ECHR 2003 ‑ II).

A rigorous supervision here not only serves to protect democratic political parties from arbitrary interferences by the authorities, but also protects democracy itself, since any restriction on freedom of expression in this context without sufficiently foreseeable regulations can harm open political debate, the legitimacy of the voting process and its results and, ultimately, the confidence of citizens in the integrity of democratic institutions and their commitment to the rule of law.",

CPT delegations continue to receive credible allegations of detained juveniles being ill-treated. The allegations often concern kicks, slaps, punches or blows with batons at the time of apprehension (even after the juvenile concerned has been brought under control), during transportation or subsequent questioning in law-enforcement establishments.

They claimed to have been victims of degrading treatment. They further complained that the investigation into their complaints had been ineffective, incomplete, biased and excessively long. They relied on Articles 3, 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention, the first of which reads as follows:",

Reiterating that the Court was master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case and finding that these complaints covered the same ground, the Chamber found it appropriate to examine the applicants’ allegations solely under Article 3 of the Convention. The Grand Chamber agrees with this approach. It will therefore proceed in the same manner."

            [
                "56. In its judgment the Chamber referred to the principles emerging from the Court’s case-law on Article 3 of the Convention. It referred in particular to the principle that where the events in issue lay wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact would arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. It was then for the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. The Chamber also referred to the principle that where an individual was deprived of liberty or, more generally, was confronted with law-enforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which had not been made strictly necessary by the person’s own conduct diminished human dignity and was in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. It further referred to the principle that in order for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 it had to attain a minimum level of severity. Furthermore, some forms of violence, although they might be condemned on moral grounds and also very broadly under the domestic law of the Contracting States, would not fall within Article 3. The Chamber further noted that the Government had disputed the fact that the applicants had been slapped by police officers, and had submitted that the medical certificates provided did not establish that the injuries recorded had been caused by such slaps. It nevertheless found it pointless to rule on the veracity or otherwise of the applicants’ allegations, considering that, even supposing that they were proved, the acts complained of by the applicants would not, in the circumstances of the case, constitute treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Chamber concluded as follows (§ 51):",
                "“... [E]ven supposing that the slapping took place, in both cases it was an isolated slap inflicted thoughtlessly by a police officer who was exasperated by the applicants’ disrespectful or provocative conduct, without seeking to make them confess. Moreover, there was apparently an atmosphere of tension between the members of the applicants’ family and police officers in their neighbourhood. In those circumstances, even though one of the applicants was only 17 at the time and whilst it is comprehensible that, if the events really took place as the applicants described, they must have felt deep resentment, the Court cannot ignore the fact that these were one-off occurrences in a situation of nervous tension and without any serious or long-term effect. It takes the view that acts of this type, though unacceptable, cannot be regarded as generating a sufficient degree of humiliation or debasement for a breach of Article 3 of the Convention to be established. In other words, in any event, the above-mentioned threshold of severity has not been reached in the present case, such that no question of a violation of that provision, under either its substantive or its procedural head, arises.”"

                "57. As regards the substantive aspect of Article 3, the applicants complained that the Chamber had departed from the principles established by the Grand Chamber. They submitted that the Chamber had omitted to apply the presumptions of causality and severity involved in cases of violence against persons who had been deprived of their liberty or were under the control of the police. In such cases there was a presumption of a causal link between the marks left by blows and their imputability to the police, which could be rebutted by reasonable explanations from the alleged perpetrators. If that was not the case, the second presumption came into play where the victim was deprived of his or her liberty: since the use of physical force inherently infringed human dignity, any such act was presumed to be serious and incompatible with Article 3, although the alleged perpetrator could rebut that presumption by arguing that the use of force had been strictly necessary in the light of the victim’s behaviour. The applicants submitted that the Court could only examine the severity of the act “on a subsidiary basis” in determining whether it should be classified as “torture” or “inhuman or degrading treatment”."

They inferred from this that the presumption of causality applied and noted that the Government, like the police services at the domestic level, had provided no explanations capable of rebutting that presumption, confining themselves to denying that there had ever been any slaps. Furthermore, the use of force against them had been neither necessary nor proportionate. The applicants pointed out that no traces of blows had been found on the police officers who had slapped them, that they themselves had not put up any active physical resistance, that the police and the Belgian State – having always denied slapping the applicants – were unable to establish that the slaps had been necessary, and that consideration should be given to the context of police violence in Belgium. Moreover, the atmosphere of nervousness and disrespect and the conflict between the neighbourhood police and the Bouyid family were insufficient to establish the need for using force. The first applicant added that the identity check for which he had been stopped by the police had been unjustified, that the reasons for the check were obscure, that his jacket had been ripped during the incident, that he had been much more slightly built than the police officer who had slapped him, that he had been a minor at the material time, that the slap had left him in a state of shock, that his feelings of fear and stress had been increased by the fact that he had already had an eardrum perforated four years previously as a result of a blow inflicted by a police officer, and that he had been faced with the silence and corporatist spirit of the police.

Furthermore, in its report on its visit to Belgium from 18 to 27 April 2005, the CPT had pointed out that “the risk of a person being ill-treated by law-enforcement officers while in detention cannot be dismissed” (cited above, § 11). Moreover, in its final comments on the third periodic report of Belgium, the UN Committee against Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment had noted with concern the persistent allegations of unlawful use of violence by law-enforcement officials and recommended “thorough”, “independent” and “impartial” investigations (CAT/C/BEL/CO/3, 28 October-22 November 2013, § 13). The applicants also submitted that four complaints of police violence were posted every week on the website of the Observatory of Police Violence (OBSPOL) set up by the French-language section of the Belgian Human Rights League. They also had the impression that police officers systematically filed a complaint as soon as a complaint was filed against them, and that even where cases did come before a court, judgment was deferred more frequently than for the average member of the public.

They also accepted that the act in question was presumed to be serious where the person concerned was in custody, in which case the Court accepted de facto that the person’s dignity was undermined, although that presumption could be rebutted by proving that the use of force had been strictly necessary in the light of the victim’s conduct.

Furthermore, the officers in question had always vehemently denied having committed such acts, and none of the evidence gathered during the investigation had refuted their statements. The Government also observed that members of the Bouyid family had lodged several other complaints against officers from their local police station, each time against the background of a confrontation with the police after they had been stopped and questioned.

This third-party intervener noted that, in concluding that the severity threshold of Article 3 had not been reached, the Chamber had taken account of the applicants’ allegedly disrespectful or provocative conduct, the tense climate which had prevailed between the members of the applicants’ family and their local police officers, and the facts that the slaps had not been intended to extract confessions and that they had been isolated acts without any serious or long-term effects. It considered that in the light of the Court’s case-law, the first three of these four factors were irrelevant. Although it deemed the fourth factor valid, it submitted that there was one criterion to which cardinal importance must be attached in determining whether the severity threshold had been reached in relation to an act committed against a person deprived of his liberty by the police, namely the fact of the police officers abusing their power vis-à-vis persons who were completely under their control. In such cases the severity threshold should be lowered. With reference to Salman v. Turkey ([GC], no. 21986/93, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII), Denis Vasilyev v. Russia (no. 32704/04, 17 December 2009) and Valiulienė v. Lithuania (no. 33234/07, 26 March 2013), the third-party intervener pointed out that the Court considered that persons in police custody were in a vulnerable position and that Article 3 imposed a duty on States to protect the physical well-being of persons who were in such a position, and that it took account of the victim’s feeling of fear and helplessness in assessing whether the Article 3 threshold had been reached. The third-party intervener took the view that the same applied even more so to minors deprived of their liberty, given their particular vulnerability. In this context, a mere slap could have serious psychological repercussions which were incompatible with the requirements of Article 3, especially as such a slap could be taken as a threat of more severe violence in the event of refusal to cooperate, or even as a punishment."

This third-party intervener stressed that international human rights law only allowed the use of physical force by law-enforcement officials to the extent that it was necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. It referred to Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, General Comment No. 20 of the UN Human Rights Committee, the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the European Code of Police Ethics (cited above) and the European Prison Rules (to which the Court and the CPT referred in their work), as well as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Guidebook on Democratic Policing. It derived the following principles from those texts: everyone had the right not to be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment specified that these terms should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses; non-violent means should be attempted first; force should be used only when strictly necessary, and solely for lawful law-enforcement purposes; in their relations with persons in detention, law-enforcement officials should not use force, except when strictly necessary for the maintenance of security and order within the institution, or when personal safety was threatened; no exceptions or excuses should be allowed for unlawful use of force; the use of force was always to be proportionate to lawful objectives; restraint should be exercised in the use of force; damage and injury should be minimised; a range of means for differentiated use of force should be made available; all law-enforcement officials should be trained in the use of the various means for differentiated use of force; and all officers should be trained in the use of non-violent means."

The third-party intervener stated that the principle established by the Court to the effect that any recourse to force by a State agent against a person deprived of his liberty which had not been made strictly necessary by that person’s conduct diminished human dignity and was in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. This principle was also enshrined in the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (it referred to Loayza-Tamayo v. Peru (merits), judgment of 17 September 1997, § 57, Series C No. 33). Furthermore, the Court had specified that where the absence of such strict necessity had been established, there was no need to assess the severity of the suffering caused in order to find a violation of Article 3 (it referred to Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, § 113, ECHR 2001 ‑ III); where such necessity had been established, all the decisive factors were taken into account, including the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim, as well as his or her particular vulnerability; and detained persons were vulnerable because they were under the absolute control of the police or prison staff. The third-party intervener added that in a judgment of 2 June 2010 (no. 543/2010) the Spanish Supreme Court, taking into account this vulnerability, had ruled that a slap administered by a police officer to a detainee had been humiliating and degrading despite the lack of any visible injury. This approach had also been adopted by the previous Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism, the CPT and the UN Human Rights Committee."

With reference to the UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the work of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the third-party intervener added that it was well established that the use of force against children was prohibited save for a very limited number of purposes. That applied to all forms of violence, including non-physical or unintentional violence, whatever their frequency or severity, and even where they were not motivated by intent to harm. Like the CPT in its ninth general activity report, it condemned in particular the “pedagogical use of force” (especially “pedagogical slaps”), which consisted in using force in response to a refusal to cooperate or bad behaviour, while the CPT also noted that police stations were the places where young people ran the greatest risk of deliberate ill-treatment."

On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Salman, cited above, § 100; Rivas v. France, no. 59584/00, § 38, 1 April 2004; and also, among other authorities, Turan Cakir v. Belgium, no. 44256/06, § 54, 10 March 2009; Mete and Others v.

In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see, among other authorities, El-Masri, cited above, § 152).

Further factors include the purpose for which the ill-treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it (compare, inter alia, Aksoy v.

In 1973 the European Commission of Human Rights stressed that in the context of Article 3 of the Convention the expression “degrading treatment” showed that the general purpose of that provision was to prevent particularly serious interferences with human dignity (see East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, nos. 4403/70 and 30 others, Commission’s report of 14 December 1973, Decisions and Reports 78-A, p. 56, § 192). The Court, for its part, made its first explicit reference to this concept in the judgment in Tyrer (cited above), concerning not “degrading treatment” but “degrading punishment”. In finding that the punishment in question was degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court had regard to the fact that “although the applicant did not suffer any severe or long-lasting physical effects, his punishment ­ – whereby he was treated as an object in the power of the authorities – constituted an assault on precisely that which it is one of the main purposes of Article 3 to protect, namely a person’s dignity and physical integrity” (ibid., § 33). Many subsequent judgments have highlighted the close link between the concepts of “degrading treatment” and respect for “dignity” (see, for example, Kudła v.

That is particularly true when the slap is inflicted by law-enforcement officers on persons under their control, because it highlights the superiority and inferiority which by definition characterise the relationship between the former and the latter in such circumstances. The fact that the victims know that such an act is unlawful, constituting a breach of moral and professional ethics by those officers and – as the Chamber rightly emphasised in its judgment – also being unacceptable, may furthermore arouse in them a feeling of arbitrary treatment, injustice and powerlessness (for consideration of this kind of feeling in the context of Article 3 of the Convention, see, for example, Petyo Petkov v.

The authorities are consequently under a duty to protect them (see paragraphs 83-84 above). In inflicting the humiliation of being slapped by one of their officers they are clearly disregarding this duty."

The Grand Chamber therefore departs from the Chamber’s approach on this point. As the Court has previously pointed out, even under the most difficult circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (see paragraph 81 above). In a democratic society ill-treatment is never an appropriate response to problems facing the authorities. The police, specifically, must “not inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances” (European Code of Police Ethics, § 36; see paragraph 51 above). Furthermore, Article 3 of the Convention establishes a positive obligation on the State to train its law-enforcement officials in such a manner as to ensure their high level of competence in their professional conduct so that no one is subjected to torture or treatment that runs counter to that provision (see Davydov and Others, cited above, § 268)."

He was therefore a minor at the material time. Ill ‑ treatment is liable to have a greater impact – especially in psychological terms – on a minor (see, for example, Rivas, cited above, § 42, and Darraj v. France, no. 34588/07, § 44, 4 November 2010) than on an adult. More broadly, the Court has on numerous occasions stressed the vulnerability of minors in the context of Article 3 of the Convention. That was the case, for instance, in Okkalı v. Turkey (no. 52067/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII); Yazgül Yılmaz v. Turkey (no. 36369/06, 1 February 2011) and Iurcu v. the Republic of Moldova (no. 33759/10, 9 April 2013).

I asked an approaching policeman, who was dressed in a helmet and black uniform and was holding a truncheon and a shield, to help me stand up. Instead of helping me, the policeman hit me over my right eye with the truncheon. I held my eye crying, and when I said to him: “What have I done to you that you hit me?”, I saw him raising his arm to hit me again. At this point I felt that some other policemen standing nearby said something to him, and then all of them went away from me. I could not see any rank insignia on their shoulders. I would not be able to recognise the policeman who hit me and the policemen who were near him. It is possible that some of the civilians who were nearby saw [this incident], but I do not know specifically who witnessed it. I stood up by myself and while I was hobbling in the direction of Pharmacy no. 259, an unknown old man took me by the arm and accompanied me to the pharmacy so that I could get medical aid. That man left after we arrived at the pharmacy. The pharmacy was all covered with blood, [and] there were several injured civilians inside. At this point some soldiers approached the pharmacy and started knocking on the window, and a grey -haired old woman who was an employee of the pharmacy [admonished them]. At the same time, when I.G., whom I recognised because he used to be a television journalist, tried to open the door of the pharmacy [from inside], one of the soldiers [who was standing outside] tried to hit him with a truncheon but missed. The reason [I.G. wanted to open the door and go outside] was that he wanted to call an ambulance for the injured ... After a while an ambulance took us to a hospital ... In the hospital, I received stitches on my wounded eyebrow, and the next day I was transferred to the Institute of Eye Diseases ... There I underwent an operation which lasted about 3 hours ...

Greece, no. 17060/03, § § 46-47, 24 May 2007; Kurnaz and Others v. Turkey, no. 36672/97, § § 53-55, 24 July 2007; Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, § § 60-61, 24 July 2008; Saya and Others v.

In the present case, the very fact that the injuries resulted from the use of force by the police is in dispute (compare with Stoica v. Romania, no. 42722/02, § § 48 and 66, 4 March 2008 )."

                "108. However, the Court considers that the applicant has been able to produce sufficiently strong evidence supporting her version of the incident and giving rise to a prima facie case of ill-treatment at the hands of the police. In particular, her medical records of 16 and 17 October 2003 confirm the allegation that she sustained serious injuries on 16 October 2003 in the course of the disorder at Azadliq Square. She also produced two witness statements which directly corroborated her allegation that the injury had resulted from a blow by a police truncheon (see paragraphs 51-52 above), and another statement which indirectly corroborated her allegation and was consistent with her version of the incident (see paragraph 50 above). The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the statements of A.A. and G.G. were inconsistent with each other and with the applicant ’ s allegations. Specifically, both of these witnesses clearly and repeatedly stated that they had seen a police officer hit the applicant in her face with a truncheon. In this respect, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency with the main thrust of the applicant ’ s allegation – namely, that the injury was inflicted by the police. Even if there are some variations in the witnesses ’ recollection of the part of the events that followed the alleged blow by the truncheon, they are not mutually exclusive and are so insignificant that, on their own, they are incapable of rendering these testimonies unreliable and should not affect the overall assessment of evidence. Taking into account the fact that these witnesses testified before the domestic authorities several months after the incident, the Court notes that the passage of time inevitably takes a toll on a witness ’ s capacity to recall events with great detail and accuracy (compare with İpek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, § 116, ECHR 2004 ‑ II (extracts) ). In any event, at no time have these witnesses ’ independence and credibility been questioned at the domestic level and it has never been established that any of these witnesses committed perjury in court (see also paragraph 122 below). In such circumstances, the Court finds no reasons why their testimonies should not have been accepted."

Moreover, in the particular circumstances of the present case, special importance should be attached to the fact that the injury was sustained while the applicant was within the area in which the law ‑ enforcement authorities were conducting an operation during which they resorted to the use of force for the purpose of quelling mass unrest. In this connection, the Court notes that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force in certain well-defined circumstances. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Kurnaz and Others, cited above, § 52, and Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, § 63, 12 April 2007 ). Recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by a person ’ s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention."

Having regard to the materials in the case file and publicly available sources describing the events of 16 October 2003 (see paragraphs 71-77 above), the Court notes, first of all, that the information available is rather scant and lacks great detail, as a result of which it is difficult to reconstruct an exact and detailed sequence of events. However, certain facts can be discerned to the extent sufficient for the purposes of the analysis in the present case. In particular, it appears that a number of protesters had indeed vandalised public and private property and attacked those police units which had already been deployed in the area. The Court accepts that such behaviour may well quickly degenerate into a riot, necessitating an intervention by the security forces. Nevertheless, it also appears that a number of protesters were uninvolved in the hostilities and did not resist the authorities or engage in other acts of violence. The latter observation is supported by the reports that, out of the estimated thousands of protesters, around 600 were arrested and ultimately around 125 were brought to trial on criminal charges in connection with the violence (see paragraphs 72 and 76-77 above)."

It also appears that the authorities brought in reinforcements and allowed the protesters to gather at Azadliq Square before surrounding them and commencing the operation to quell the disorder. Thus, when the authorities resorted to the use of force, their operation was essentially confined to this limited area of the city. The Court also observes that the operation involved not only riot police, but also military forces. All of them were fully equipped with helmets, shields, truncheons and other special equipment. The authorities were able to deploy them in large numbers (several thousands, according to various reports) within a fairly short period of time. The Court considers that the authorities ’ ability to intervene in such a manner required a certain degree of preparation. Moreover, having regard to the fact that some protests and skirmishes between the protesters and the police had already begun on the night before the events of 16 October, the authorities must have had some prior warning of impending difficulties and a possible escalation of violence. It therefore does not appear that the authorities were called upon to react in a completely random and unprepared manner (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 72, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ) and should have been able to anticipate any developments and take at least some measures to evaluate and avoid unnecessary risks and to refrain from applying force in an indiscriminate and disorderly manner."

Judging by the sheer numbers of people involved and injured, it is undeniable that on 16 October 2003 there occurred a particularly large-scale confrontation between a large number of protesters and law-enforcement officers, which involved a high degree of violence on both sides. Therefore, the situation called for a particularly thorough scrutiny of the actions of not only those protesters who acted violently, but also of the law-enforcement authorities. However, in their observations the Government merely stated that force had to be used against the protesters, without providing any explanation or documentation which could shed light on the exact nature and scale of the force used. They have not submitted any evidence to show that any monitoring of the authorities ’ actions was ever carried out at the domestic level. They have not produced any official reports on the incident, setting out in detail the sequence of events, assessing the necessity and proportionality of the force used, and analysing the possibility (or impossibility) of utilising less violent or non-violent means. While a criminal investigation was formally instituted to investigate the violent actions of the protesters, it is unclear from the materials submitted by the parties whether any such formal inquiry was made into the actions of the law-enforcement authorities.

In particular, as to the cause of injury, the report stated that it was due to a “trauma suffered by her”, without explaining the cause of such trauma. Furthermore, in reply to the specific question as to whether the specific injury to her eye could have been caused by a police truncheon, it offered the rather vague answer that “no damage typically attributable to a police truncheon [had] been discovered on [the applicant ’ s] person”. However, the report offered no substantiation for such an answer and left it unsupported by any analysis or argumentation based on forensic science.

In the present case, the applicant was neither a suspect nor an accused, so the argument appears to be misplaced. The Court also notes that, in support of this argument, the Government has not submitted any evidence or documents showing the practical availability at the relevant time of the necessary facilities for such “alternative expert examination” and, more importantly, any examples where conclusions of such an examination had been admitted by the prosecution authorities to the criminal file as valid forensic evidence.

                "32. Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it, and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities; and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."

                "34. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."

                "35. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time, to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."

Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20)."

The measures taken against her had not, therefore, pursed any legitimate aim. Lastly, the applicant submitted that the refusal to approve her public event, her arrest and conviction had not been “necessary in a democratic society ”. In the applicant ’ s opinion, the authorities had given all the suitable locations to the United Russia party to make the opposition protest illegal. The aim of the event she had organised had been to raise an important issue of public interest: corruption of high-ranking public officials. It had been peaceful and had not caused any disturbances of public order or of traffic, or any material damage. No calls for violence or insulting statements had been made during the meeting. The applicant had been arrested and detained for more than four hours, and sentenced to a fine and twenty hours of community work for the sole reason that she had organised a public event which the authorities had unlawfully refused to approve before that.

The judicial review remedy under former Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Judicial Review Act available at the material time suffered from two defects which rendered it ineffective under Article 13. Firstly, it did not allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve the location, time or the manner of conducting a public event before its planned date. Secondly, its scope was limited to examining the lawfulness of the proposal to change a public event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted, and did not include any assessment of its “necessity in a democratic society” and “proportionality”."

The Court notes that, since the facts prompting the applications joined in Lashmankin and Others arose, a new Code of Administrative Procedure (“the CAP”) reforming the applicable judicial review procedures entered into force on 15 September 2015. It provides, in particular, that complaints against the authorities ’ decisions concerning changes to the purposes, location, type or manner of conduct of a public event are to be examined by a district court, and if possible any appeal is also to be examined, before the planned date of the event. If the court allows the complaint, it requires the authority or official to remedy the breach of the complainant ’ s rights – in particular by determining the specific steps which need to be taken – and sets out a time ‑ limit. The judicial decision is subject to immediate enforcement (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 289 - 94 and 297 ). The Court considers that those developments in the domestic law have corrected the first defect identified in Lashmankin and Others, by henceforth allowing an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve a public event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted before its planned date."

The District Court found that the refusal had been unlawful. That decision was subject to immediate enforcement. However, as later explained by the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic, “the judicial decision finding [the town administration ’ s] failure to act unlawful did not amount to an unconditional approval of the location and time of the public event ... The above [judicial decision] did not therefore transform an unauthorised public event into an authorised one” (see paragraph 25 above). Further action by the town administration was accordingly necessary to make the applicant ’ s public event legal. However, the District Court did not order any remedial action, although it had powers to do so under the CAP (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 297, and paragraph 36 above).

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 66, ECHR 1999 ‑ II; Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 152, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII; and V.K. v. Croatia, no. 38380/08, §§ 112-17, 27 November 2012 ). For the Court, it would be inconceivable that Article 13 provided the right to have a remedy, and for it to be effective, without protecting the implementation of the remedies afforded. To hold the contrary would lead to situations that were incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see V.K. v Croatia, cited above, § 114)."

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

                "84. The Court reiterates that it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 65 in fine, Series A no. 30). In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by “campaigning” for participation in a public event that had not been duly approved is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with her freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to sentence her to a fine, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case."

The Court notes in this connection that the message published by the applicant criticised the authorities for not allowing a public event demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Medvedev, suspected of large-scale corruption. The issues raised in that Internet post were a matter of public concern and the applicant ’ s comments therein contributed to an on-going political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that under its case-law, expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection (see Perinçek, cited above, § 230). There is therefore little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on expression on matters of public interest ( see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV) and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions ( see Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § 47, with further references)."

There was no reason to believe that the event in question, although not duly approved, would not be peaceful. Indeed, the impugned Internet post did not contain any calls to commit violent, disorderly or otherwise unlawful acts during the public event."

            [
                "87. The Court also observes that the approval of the public event in question was refused on formal grounds, rather than because it presented a risk of disorder or crime, or posed a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Indeed, the only ground for the refusal was that the locations chosen by the applicant would be occupied by other public events. It is important to note that the authorities did not claim that there was a risk of clashes between the two events or that, in view of the size of the venue and the expected number of participants, holding the two events simultaneously would jeopardise participants ’ safety. The Court has previously found that a refusal to approve the venue of a public assembly solely on the basis that it was due to take place at the same time and location as another public event and in the absence of a clear and objective indication that both events could not be managed in an appropriate manner through the exercise of policing powers, was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 422). It is also significant that the refusal to approve the location of the applicant ’ s event was later found to be unlawful by the domestic courts."

                "88. Lastly, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated in her message that the authorities had refused to approve the event, that she considered that refusal to be unlawful and that she had therefore lodged a judicial review complaint against it. She did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in an approved event. She also tried to minimise possible inconvenience to non-participants by proposing to hold the event in a park at a specially designated location for public events where there was no traffic. In view of the event ’ s location and peaceful character, and in the absence of any identified risk of clashes with other public events, there was no reason to believe that it would be necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee the event ’ s smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by. The breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events in the present case did not, therefore, result in any risk of hindrance of the rights of others."

            [
                "89. It follows that the only reason for the interference in the present case was the need to punish unlawful conduct. Given that the breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events was minor and did not create any real risk of public disorder or crime, and had no potential to lead to harmful consequences for public safety or the rights of others, that reason is not sufficient to justify the applicant ’ s conviction for making calls to participate in an event on a topical issue of public interest (see, for similar reasoning, Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 255 01/07 and 4 others, § 199, 26 April 2016).

The domestic courts had not collected the evidence for the prosecution: the evidence had been collected and submitted to the courts by competent officials and by the defence; the courts ’ role had been limited to assessing that evidence. Given that administrative-offence cases were usually simple, it was not necessary for the prosecutor to participate in the oral hearings.

In his defence the applicant argued that his company could not purchase gas directly from the producers, because the minimum quantity which the producers agreed to sell exceeded his company ’ s needs for a period of five years. Therefore, it was impossible for his company to purchase the amounts of gas needed directly from the producers. Moreover, the producers only accepted 100% pre-payment and his company did not have the available funds. He submitted that all national gas importers used the same method of importing gas and that the price of the gas purchased by his company was lower than that on the free national market. He further argued that the difference in price between that of the producers and that paid by his company was explained by transportation costs, certification, handling, insurance and other factors.

Whether the mere persistence of suspicion suffices to warrant the prolongation of a lawfully ordered detention on remand is covered, not by paragraph 1 (c) as such, but by paragraph 3: it is essentially the object of the latter, which forms a whole with the former, to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, § 44, with further references)."

                "100. The need to further elaborate the case-law appears to stem from the fact that the period during which the persistence of reasonable suspicion may suffice as a ground for continued detention under the second limb is subject to a different and far less precise temporal requirement – “a certain lapse of time” (as developed in the Court ’ s case-law) – than under the first limb – “promptly” (as provided in the text of the Convention) – and that it is only after that “certain lapse of time” that the detention has to be justified by additional relevant and sufficient reasons. It is true that in some instances the Court has held that “[t]hese two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked” (see, most notably, McKay, cited above, § 31; and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 119, ECHR 2010 – the latter being concerned only with the first limb). However, it should be noted that in each context the period will start to run from the time of arrest, and that the judicial authority authorising the detention is required to determine whether there are reasons to justify detention and to order release if there are no such reasons. Thus, in practice, it would often be the case that the application of the guarantees under the second limb would to some extent overlap with those of the first limb, typically in situations where the judicial authority which authorises detention under the first limb at the same time orders detention on remand subject to the guarantees of the second limb. In such situations, the first appearance of the suspect before the judge constitutes the “crossroads ” where the two sets of guarantees meet and where the second set succeeds the first. And yet, the question of when the second applies to its full extent, in the sense that further relevant and sufficient reasons additional to reasonable suspicion are required, is left to depend on the rather vague notion of “ a certain lapse of time”."

The Court further notes that, according to the domestic laws of the great majority of the thirty - one High Contracting Parties to the Convention covered by the comparative law survey referred to in paragraph 54 above, the relevant judicial authorities are obliged to give “relevant and sufficient” reasons for continued detention if not immediately then only a few days after the arrest, namely when a judge examines for the first time the necessity of placing the suspect in pre-trial detention. Such an approach, if transposed to Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, would not only simplify and bring more clarity and certainty into the Convention case-law in this area, but would also enhance the protection against detention beyond a reasonable time."

A systematic reading of the Convention shows that mere restrictions on the liberty of movement are not covered by Article 5 but fall under Article 2 § 1 of Protocol No. 4. However, the distinction between the restriction of movement and the deprivation of liberty is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting point must be the concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Guzzardi v.

In particular, it appears clearly from the facts of the case that the idea behind the applicant ’ s seeking to be placed in house arrest was to avoid the continuation of his detention in custody after the courts had dismissed his habeas corpus requests on numerous occasions. It also transpires that his state of health considerably deteriorated during his remand in custody and that he was ready to make concessions in order to put an end to it (see paragraphs 14, 2 4 and 29 above). This is understandable behaviour for a person who had previously suffered a heart attack and a cerebral stroke and who was seeing his health deteriorating. In the Court ’ s view, the applicant was under a clear state of duress when he was placed under house arrest.

That is the case because detention in custody requires integrating the individual into a new and sometimes hostile environment, sharing of activities and resources with other inmates, observing discipline and being subjected to supervision of varying degrees by the authorities twenty-four hours a day. For example, detainees cannot freely choose when to go to sleep, when to take their meals, when to attend to their personal hygiene needs or when to perform outdoor exercise or other activities. Therefore, when faced with a choice between imprisonment in a detention facility and house arrest, as in the present case, most individuals would normally opt for the latter."

It further reiterates that in Lavents (cited above), where the Court was called upon to examine the relevance and sufficiency of reasons for depriving the applicant of liberty pending trial for a considerable period of time, the respondent Government had unsuccessfully argued that different criteria ought to apply to the assessment of the reasons for the impugned restriction on liberty as the applicant had been detained not only in prison but also been held in house arrest and in hospital. The Court dismissed the argument, stating that Article 5 did not regulate the conditions of detention, referring to the approach previously adopted in Mancini (cited above) and other cases cited therein. The Court went on to specify that the notions of “degree” and “intensity” in the case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, referred only to the degree of restrictions to the liberty of movement, not to the differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court proceeded to apply the same criteria for the entire period of deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained."

Such justifications should, on the contrary, be assessed according to criteria that are practical and effective in maintaining an adequate level of protection under the Article 5 without running a risk of diluting that protection.

While the latter reason is normally invoked in the context of the risk of absconding, the national court considered that the danger of absconding along with the risk of influencing witnesses and the risk of the applicant ’ s tampering with evidence had not been substantiated by the prosecutor and were implausible."

In such circumstances, the Court sees no merit whatsoever in this argument. Furthermore, it notes that the Court of Appeal failed to give an answer to this objection raised by the applicant. There is no indication in the judgments that the courts took into account such an important factor as the applicant ’ s behaviour, between the beginning of the investigation in July 2006 and the moment when first ordering his remand in custody."

This time the courts invoked other reasons, namely the danger of absconding and the risk of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence (see paragraphs 20 and 25 above). In this regard, the Court notes that these were the same reasons as had been invoked by the prosecutor in the initial application for placing the applicant in detention on remand but which both the first - instance court and the Court of Appeal had dismissed as being unsubstantiated and improbable (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). There is no explanation in the court decisions prolonging the applicant ’ s detention as to why those reasons became relevant and sufficient only later (see, for instance, Koutalidis v. Greece, no. 18785/13, § 51, 27 November 2014), for instance whether anything in the applicant ’ s behaviour had prompted the change.

A “Memorandum on detentions in connection with the international match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009”, prepared by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander for the event, was submitted to the City Court. It stated that the police had received intelligence reports that hooligan groups from both countries were set on fighting each other on the match day. The risk of fighting was increased by the fact that the match would not start until 8 p.m., leaving considerable time for each group to consume alcoholic beverages beforehand. In order to prevent such clashes, the plan was to start engaging in proactive dialogue from 12 noon, when the first fans/spectators appeared, and in the event of clashes, first to arrest the instigators under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act and charge them or, if that was not possible, to detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. Since detention under the latter provision, as far as possible, should not exceed six hours, the memorandum specifically stated that it was preferable to avoid detaining anyone too early during the day, since they would then have to be released during or after the game, with the possibility that they would head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls. At 3.41 p.m. the first big fight started between Danish and Swedish supporters at Amagertorv Square, on Strøget in the centre of Copenhagen, resulting in five or six individuals being detained, including the second and third applicants. Subsequently, elsewhere, other supporters were detained, including the first applicant. Up until the start of the match, further individuals who instigated and directed fights were detained, but the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of supporters behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. After the match, another large brawl started in the city centre, resulting in further detentions of a large group of Swedish and Danish supporters/hooligans."

                "“... that he was the strategic commander for the event and located in the control room in connection with the international football match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009. The police had received intelligence reports of intentions among various club factions from Denmark and Sweden to initiate hooligan brawls in connection with the match. The police were therefore prepared for it not to be the usual audience of festive Danish and Swedish supporters. This information had come from police ‘spotters’ in different networks of football fans. They had received information that Danish and Swedish groups had planned to collaborate ... Police preparations had targeted different locations in Copenhagen. It was the intention to locate the various groups, talk to them to calm them down and accordingly dampen tempers before they reached the national stadium. The police had already deployed forces and divided them into groups at around 2 p.m. on the basis of intelligence that the spectators would arrive early to go partying. They had managed to locate the groups of fans by means of their spotters, and it had turned out that the fans were divided into a Swedish and a Danish group. They had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish hooligans at around 3.40 p.m. The fight had occurred in the central part of Strøget, the pedestrian shopping street, outside bar D, where the Swedish group had settled down. Prior to the fight, they had located the Danish groups in the central courtyard of Boltens Gård. According to the intelligence, the Danish people involved were supporters of the football clubs of Brøndby, Lyngby [Copenhagen] and AGF [Aarhus]. This intelligence had been collected by police officers in the home towns of these clubs. Those police officers had come to Copenhagen to assist, and they had recognised supporters.",
                "The fight had taken the police somewhat by surprise, but they had managed to segregate the Swedish supporters at the bar D, and guide the Danish participants down Valkendorffsgade, a small side street off the pedestrian shopping street. It was a group of about fifty to sixty Danish fans altogether. He did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty or sixty persons on either side. A fight of this kind causes a lot of uncertainty.",
                "He himself had been in the control room, but had had regular contact with people at the scene of the incident. He was the one who had made the decision to detain persons who could not be charged with an offence, that is, detention pursuant to the Police Act. It had been planned that only the instigators should be detained. To the extent possible, they had also intended to avoid detaining many people early in the day because those people would then have to be released during or right after the match and would then be able to head for the city centre again and resume fighting. He had made use of local [police] spotters to identify six leading members, who had then been detained. They had been identified on the basis of police officers’ prior knowledge of them, combined with their ongoing observations. The crucial factor had naturally been the individuals’ actual behaviour. They would not have been detained if they had not been acting as instigators ...",
                "The detainees had been released following an assessment of the situation in central Copenhagen. The police had started releasing the detainees after midnight, when the situation in central Copenhagen had calmed down and it had been assessed that there was no one with whom the newly released persons could start a fight. He was, of course, aware of the six-hour rule laid down in the Police Act, but it might be necessary to exceed this maximum period. They had done so deliberately that particular evening. Had there been no violence after the expiry of the six-hour period, there would have been no justification for not releasing the detainees. The purpose had definitely been to avoid confrontations and fights and situations causing uncertainty. They had made a continuous assessment during the period of detention.",

The control room team had included an investigator who had had regular contact with the Bellahøj police station regarding the detentions. The detainees who had been charged with an offence had been released after the match. As regards the persons detained under the Police Act, a comprehensive, general assessment had been made and then those persons had been released one by one when the danger had passed. He had been involved in the general assessment of the length of the detention periods, but not in the assessment of the individual cases. The control room had been closed down shortly after midnight, when the observers around the city had reported that things were quiet and that people were on their way home/back to their hotels. As already mentioned, it had been decided to release detainees on the basis of a general assessment made in the control room, but the actual releases had been effected at the Bellahøj police station. The police’s assessment had been that the detainees would meet up again and start new fights if released before the streets of the city centre had become quiet ...”"

They had received intelligence that hooligans from Aarhus would meet with other hooligans from Denmark to fight Swedish football fans. The Copenhagen Police had asked for help from the police of other districts in Denmark who were familiar with members of local factions. He and his colleagues had met at around 11 a.m. for a briefing. He and a colleague of his from the Police of Eastern Jutland had then moved around the city to look for any hooligans from Aarhus whom they might recognise. They had been told that people from Brøndby had gathered at a particular bar, and they had gone there. Among the people they had seen were [the first and second applicants]. [The second applicant] had been sitting together with A, the leader of South Side United (SSU), which is a local faction from Brøndby. There had been a good atmosphere, and no violence. The witness had remained standing outside for a short while and had talked to people from Aarhus. It had probably been around 1 p.m. He and his colleague and some other officers had then posted themselves opposite the bar to keep an eye on what was going on. They had received reports that Swedes and Danes were to meet and fight. At some point the Danish hooligans had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square [around 700 metres from the bar].",
                "[The witness] had worked in the special patrol for four years and had met [the first and second applicants] several times at previous fights in connection with football matches. He had seen them take part in fights and heard them shout ‘White Pride Hooligan’. He and his colleagues had followed the group and reported back to the control room. When they had come closer to Amagertorv Square, police personnel carriers had been parked crosswise to prevent the group from colliding with the Swedish football fans. The Danish hooligans had then been turned around and taken down a side street, where they had been registered and searched.",
                "They had been told by the control room to select two leading hooligans from Aarhus. He and his colleague had agreed on selecting [the second and third applicants]. It had happened in a calm manner. The reason why [the second applicant] had been taken to the police station was that they had indeed seen him talking to A, combined with their prior knowledge of him. [The third applicant] had also been taken to the police station because of their knowledge of him. [The witness] had written a report on the detentions a couple of hours later.",

The purpose of detaining those two persons had been to create calm and prevent clashes. This had apparently succeeded because he had been present during the international match himself, and it had been obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus had been missing someone to take control. When the group from the bar was being guided into the side street, a couple of people might have tried to disappear into the crowd, but the group had followed directions from the police.",
                "White Pride supporters were characterised by being highly structured. It was very clear that someone was in control. Directions were issued by the leaders, and the directions were obeyed. The three factions present at the bar had come from Aarhus, Brøndby and Lyngby and were not usually friends. They had come out together and walked in a group towards Amagertorv Square, where the Swedish hooligans were supposed to be.”"

He did not recall the name of this person, but it was the only person whom he had been involved in detaining. He and a colleague of his had been sitting observing in a car at Axeltorv Square, when a citizen, a man aged 40 to 45, holding his son of about five by the hand, had contacted them saying that three people, whom he had pointed out from a very short distance, were planning a fight as they had been calling various mates, telling them to meet up at the entrance to Tivoli Gardens and try to start a fight with some Swedish supporters.

                "On the relevant evening he had been assisted by two leaders, each of whom had assistance from two colleagues in carrying out body searches, and making photo recordings, of the detainees. Ten additional police officers were there to help. One of his tasks had been to make sure that the six-hour rule was observed. They had been faced with the issue that the six-hour period applicable to two of the persons detained under the Police Act expired at 9.50 p.m. He had contacted the control-room supervisor before the expiry of this period. Concurrently, clashes had been starting in the streets, and the control-room supervisor had decided not to let the relevant persons out. They had not wanted to add fuel to the fire. This decision had been made by the supervisors because he himself did not have the power to make such a decision. He had talked to the control room many times during that evening from 9.30 p.m. onwards. Very many detainees had been brought to the police station up until around 11 p.m., reaching a total of 136 detainees. Half of them had been detained under the Police Act. He had regularly asked when they should start releasing the detainees. He had not called and asked about specific names, but a general assessment had been made on an ongoing basis for all detainees from the time when the statutory six-hour periods started to expire. The radio communication had made it possible for him to keep updated about when things started calming down after the arrests of people in the Boltens Gård courtyard, and finally it had been confirmed that he could start releasing the persons detained under the Police Act. He did not keep a log of all telephone calls and was therefore unable to give the exact time. As far as he recalled, there had probably been one detainee under 18 years old who had been fetched by his parents before the end of the six-hour period, but otherwise no one else had been let out before the two initial detainees. It could very well have happened that some of his colleagues had started taking people out of the cells before the end of the six-hour period when they had received the information from the control room, because everybody was highly aware of the six-hour rule. If the persons concerned had subsequently been returned to their cells, the reason was an order from the control room saying that they should continue to be detained.”"

The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.",

It also appears from the preparatory notes on the same provision that normally the six-hour period can only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a considerable number of people, in which situations the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule.",

A detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act is outside the context of criminal proceedings (as opposed to an arrest under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act, see paragraph 35 below). The purpose of a detention under section 5(3) is not to bring the person before a judge, neither to assess the lawfulness of a continued detention. The lawfulness may, however, subsequently be subject to judicial review. According to the preparatory notes on the Police Act, detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act may not take place for the purpose of investigating or initiating criminal measures. The condition that the person must be causing a “risk or danger” implies that a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order or of danger to the safety of individuals or public security must have been ascertained. What is crucial is the probability that the risk or danger will occur if the police do not intervene. The fact that a person is a well-known troublemaker does not as such justify such measures. Prior knowledge of a person or a group of persons may, however, be taken into account, together with the current circumstances. Whether the risk or danger is sufficient to justify a measure depends on an assessment made by the police of the individual situation. As to the wording “should not extend beyond six hours where possible”, the preparatory notes point out that the period should be reckoned from the time when the detention is effected. Any time spent on transfer to a police station must therefore be included in the calculation of the detention period. The six ‑ hour period would normally only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a large number of persons, when the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule."

                "46. For the purposes of its examination of the present case, the Court deems it useful to refer to the judgment of 15 February 2017 of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, in which the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 (b) was found to be inconclusive. The four applicants in that case had been detained for up to five and a half hours to prevent an imminent breach of the peace during the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 29 April 2011. The police had argued that the detention was justified under both Article 5 § 1 (b) and Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Administrative Court found that the detention had complied with Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Court of Appeal agreed, but for other reasons. It concluded that the purpose of the applicants’ detention had been to bring them before the competent legal authority if that were to become necessary, so as to prolong their detention on a lawful basis. It declined to follow the majority view in Ostendorf v. Germany (no. 15598/08, 7 March 2013) that Article 5 § 1 (c) was incapable of authorising purely preventive detention, notwithstanding the existence of good grounds to believe an offence to be imminent, and that the person concerned must be suspected of having already committed a criminal offence.",
                "Finally, the Supreme Court, having analysed the Court’s case-law, and notably the divergent views expressed in the concurring opinion in Ostendorf (cited above), concluded that the detention was lawful under Article 5 § 1 (c). Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Mance, Lord Dyson, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath agreed) stated, in particular:",
                "“31. In this case there was nothing arbitrary about the decisions to arrest, detain and release the appellants. They were taken in good faith and were proportionate to the situation. If the police cannot lawfully arrest and detain a person for a relatively short time (too short for it to be practical to take the person before a court) in circumstances where this is reasonably considered to be necessary for the purpose of preventing imminent violence, the practical consequence would be to hamper severely their ability to carry out the difficult task of maintaining public order and safety at mass public events. This would run counter to the fundamental principles previously identified.",
                "32. There is, however, a difficult question of law as to how such preventive power can be accommodated within article 5. The Strasbourg case law on the point is not clear and settled, as is evident from the division of opinions within the Fifth Section in Ostendorf. Moreover, while this court must take into account the Strasbourg case law, in the final analysis it has a judicial choice to make.",
                "33. The view of the minority in Ostendorf, that article 5.1(c) is capable of applying in a case of detention for preventive purposes followed by early release (that is, before the person could practicably be brought before a court), is in my opinion correct for a number of reasons.",
                "34. In the first place I agree with the Administrative Court that the situation fits more naturally within the language of article 5.1(c) than 5.1(b). On its plain wording article 5.1(c) covers three types of case, the second being when the arrest or detention of a person ‘is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence.’",
                "35. There is force in the argument that the interpretation adopted by the majority in Ostendorf collapses the second into the first (‘reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’) and is inconsistent with Lawless [ Lawless v. Ireland (no. 3), 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3].",
                "36. It is accepted by the police that English courts should treat Lawless as authoritative, but in that case the court was not concerned with a situation in which the police had every reason to anticipate that the risk necessitating the person’s arrest would pass in a relatively short time and there was every likelihood of it ending before the person could as a matter of practicality be brought before a court. It would be perverse if it were the law that in such circumstances, in order to be lawfully able to detain the person so as to prevent their imminently committing an offence, the police must harbour a purpose of continuing the detention, after the risk had passed, until such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being bound over to keep the peace in future. This would lengthen the period of detention and place an unnecessary burden on court time and police resources.",
                "37. Some analogy may be drawn with Brogan, in which the court rejected the argument that at the time of the arrest the police must intend to take the arrested person before the court willy nilly, regardless of whether on investigation there was cause to do so.",
                "38. In order to make coherent sense and achieve the fundamental purpose of article 5, I would read the qualification on the power of arrest or detention under article 5.1(c), contained in the words ‘for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’, as implicitly dependent on the cause for detention continuing long enough for the person to be brought before the court. I agree therefore with Judges Lemmens and Jäderblom in para 5 of their judgment in Ostendorf (cited at para 25 above) that in the case of an early release from detention for preventive purposes, it is enough for guaranteeing the rights inherent in article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.",
                "39. I prefer to put the matter that way, rather than as the Court of Appeal did by inferring the existence of a conditional purpose ab initio to take the appellants before the court, although it makes no difference to the result. I have no disagreement with the Court of Appeal that the appellants would have been brought before a court to determine the legality of their continued detention, if it had been considered necessary to detain them long enough for this to happen. The case would then have been materially similar to Nicol and Selvanayagam, where the applicants’ initial detention was preventive and they were later kept in custody and brought before the court to be bound over. It would be contrary to the spirit and underlying objective of article 5 if the appellants’ early release placed them in a stronger position to complain of a breach of article 5 than if it had been decided to detain them for longer in order to take them before magistrates to be bound over.",
                "40. As to article 5.1(b), I am inclined to the same view as the minority in Ostendorf that the obligation has to be much more specific than a general obligation not to commit a criminal offence (or, in this case, a breach of the peace), and that such a general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of specificity by focusing narrowly on the particular facts or by the person concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. There are also practical considerations. The police may find it necessary to take action to prevent an imminent breach of the peace in circumstances where there is not sufficient time to give a warning. An example might be a football match where two unruly groups collide and the police see no alternative but to detain them, or the ringleaders on both sides, immediately for what may be quite a short time. In summary, I would be concerned that in stretching article 5.1(b) beyond its previously recognised ambit the majority found it necessary to impose limitations which in another case might leave the police effectively powerless to step in for the protection of the public.”"

The applicants had been subject to an obligation to refrain from committing criminal offences, including the obligation not to instigate fights or exhibit any other form of violent behaviour likely to disturb public order. This obligation followed from a number of provisions on punishable acts, including section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order (which is considered to define a criminal offence), and sections 134a, 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code. The obligation was specific and concrete, and the time and place of the imminent commission of the offence had been sufficiently specified, as well as its potential victims. The applicants had been aware of the large police presence in the city and it must have been clear to them that the police were there to prevent violence and disturbance in connection with the football match, notably as all three applicants had previously been detained in connection with similar events. In the Government’s view, it would have been futile for the police to have given the applicants explicit orders to disperse and refrain from arranging/taking part in brawls, as the applicants could simply have walked away from the police and engaged in hooligan brawls elsewhere. Likewise, it would have made little sense to escort them to the stadium and warn them of detention if they left the groups of hooligans, as the police had done in Ostendorf (cited above), since many of them, including the third applicant, had not even had a ticket for the match."

Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty. Three strands of reasoning in particular may be identified as running through the Court’s case-law: the exhaustive nature of the exceptions, which must be interpreted strictly, and which do not allow for the broad range of justifications under other provisions (Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention in particular); the repeated emphasis on the lawfulness of the detention, both procedural and substantive, requiring scrupulous adherence to the rule of law; and the importance of the promptness or speediness of the requisite judicial controls (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, § 84, ECHR 2016 (extracts), with further references)."

As regards the requirement to justify pre-trial detention under paragraph 3 of Article 5 in such cases, the Court has held that there must be relevant and sufficient reasons, and that the national authorities must display “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The Court has also held that justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities. When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative means of ensuring his or her appearance at trial (ibid.).

The condition that there should be no arbitrariness also demands that both the order to detain and the execution of the detention genuinely conform to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 § 1 (see Saadi, cited above, § 69). Where, for example, detention is sought to be justified by reference to the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) in order to bring a person before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, the Court has insisted upon the need for the authorities to furnish some facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence in question (see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09 and 2 others, § 193, 18 September 2012, and O’Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, §§ 34-35, ECHR 2001 ‑ X). Similarly, the Court is of the view that in order for a detention to be justified under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), the authorities must show convincingly that the person concerned would in all likelihood have been involved in the concrete and specific offence, had its commission not been prevented by the detention."

In respect of the first limb of sub-paragraph (c) the Court has found that the absence of any grounds in the judicial authorities’ decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Urtāns v. Latvia, no. 16858/11, § 28, 28 October 2014). Conversely, it has found that an applicant’s detention on remand could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention, unless the reasons given were extremely laconic and did not refer to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant’s detention (ibid.; see also Mooren, cited above, § 79, with further references).",

The Court answered the question in the negative (ibid., §§ 77-89), whilst expressing its awareness of the importance, in the German legal system, of preventive police custody in order to avert dangers to the life and limb of potential victims or significant material damage, in particular in situations involving the policing of large groups of people during mass events (ibid., § 88)."

From the Ostendorf judgment it appears that a decisive consideration for finding sub-paragraph (c) inapplicable was that it permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings and governed pre-trial detention (ibid., §§ 66-68). This interpretation was restated in different ways in the judgment, for instance in paragraph 82: “the second alternative of Article 5 § 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence”. In paragraph 86 the Court held that “detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 may be ordered, in particular, against a person having carried out punishable preparatory acts to an offence in order to prevent his committing that latter offence”. This interpretation was given with reference to the requirements under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 respectively that the person’s detention was to be effected “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority” and that the person was to “be brought promptly before a judge” and was “entitled to a trial within a reasonable time” under paragraph 3 (ibid., §§ 68, 82, 85 and 86), and also with reference to previous case-law (ibid., §§ 67-69) to the effect that sub-paragraph (c) permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings.

In the first place, starting with the aforementioned Lawless case, the first to come before the Court raising questions of interpretation of the provisions at issue, this concerned the Irish authorities’ internment of IRA members without trial. The applicant was detained for five months, without being brought before a judge, under legislation which gave ministers special powers of detention without trial, whenever the government published a proclamation that such powers were necessary to secure the preservation of peace and order. The Government argued that the applicant’s detention could be justified as being “necessary to prevent his committing an offence”, which did not also require “the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority”. The Court, however, rejected this argument, on the following grounds (emphasis added):",
                "“13. Whereas, in this connection, the question referred to the judgment of the Court is whether or not the provisions of Article 5, paragraphs 1 (c) and 3, prescribe that a person arrested or detained ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’ shall be brought before a judge, in other words whether, in Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent judicial (sic) authority [ devant l’autorité judiciaire compétente ]’ qualifies only the words ‘on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’ or also the words ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’;",
                "14. Whereas the wording of Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), is sufficiently clear to give an answer to this question; whereas it is evident that the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’ qualifies every category of cases of arrest or detention referred to in that sub-paragraph; whereas it follows that the said clause permits deprivation of liberty only when such deprivation is effected for the purpose of bringing the person arrested or detained before the competent judicial authority, irrespective of whether such person is a person who is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence, or a person whom it is reasonably considered necessary to restrain from committing an offence, or a person whom it reasonably considered necessary to restrain from absconding after having committed an offence;",
                "Whereas, further, paragraph 1 (c) of Article 5 can be construed only if read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of the same Article, with which it forms a whole; whereas paragraph 3 stipulates categorically that ‘everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge ...’ and ‘shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time’; whereas it plainly entails the obligation to bring everyone arrested or detained in any of the circumstances contemplated by the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) before a judge for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits; whereas such is the plain and natural meaning of the wording of both paragraph 1 (c) and paragraph 3 of Article 5;",
                "Whereas the meaning thus arrived at by grammatical analysis is fully in harmony with the purpose of the Convention which is to protect the freedom and security of the individual against arbitrary detention or arrest; whereas it must be pointed out in this connexion that, if the construction placed by the Court on the aforementioned provisions were not correct, anyone suspected of harbouring an intent to commit an offence could be arrested and detained for an unlimited period on the strength merely of an executive decision without its being possible to regard his arrest or detention as a breach of the Convention; whereas such an assumption, with all its implications of arbitrary power, would lead to conclusions repugnant to the fundamental principles of the Convention;"

Moreover, the requirement that the detention “be effected for the purpose of bringing [the person] before the competent [judicial] authority” applied in respect of each ground, as did the obligation to bring the person before a judge either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge, under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 of Article 5."

It is particularly noteworthy that the Court, relying heavily on the approach adopted in Steel and Others (cited above), examined the matter under both limbs of Article 5 § 1 (c) and, in doing so, reached separate partial conclusions in respect of each of those limbs (emphasis added):",

On the contrary, in the first and third of the above-mentioned British cases, the Court left open what part of the measures fell under the one or the other ground, and in the second case it clearly distinguished between them, specifying that the initial detention fell under the preventive ground. On the basis of this analysis, the line taken in the three British cases is in a sense reminiscent of that taken in Ireland v. the United Kingdom and Guzzardi (both cited above). The former left open to what extent the respective limbs applied to the case before the Court, whereas the latter identified more clearly the application of the second limb (see paragraph 107 above) in a manner that can be traced back to the clear distinction made between the two limbs in Lawless, consistent with the Report of the Conference of Senior Officials on Human Rights to the Committee of Ministers in relation to Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 of the second draft Convention (see paragraph 42 above)."

A strict interpretation may unduly prolong the detention, after the risk has passed and the detainee should be released, because the authorities would need a realistic amount of time to bring the detainee before a judge to examine the question of deprivation of liberty."

The police must be afforded a degree of discretion in taking operational decisions. Such decisions are almost always complicated and the police, who have access to information and intelligence not available to the general public, will usually be in the best position to take them (see Austin and Others, cited above, § 56)."

The Court is also mindful that it has gradually expanded its case ‑ law concerning the State’s obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to protect the public from offences. Thus, for example, in other contexts, States are required under Article 3 to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill ‑ treatment, including such treatment administered by private individuals (see, inter alia, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports 1998 ‑ VI; M.C. v.

In this regard, the Court considers that the question whether the purpose requirement has been complied with should depend on an objective assessment of the authorities’ conduct, in particular whether the detainee, as required by Article 5 § 3, is brought promptly before a judge to have the lawfulness of his or her detention reviewed or is released before such time.

As illustrated by the flexible approach adopted in Brogan and Others (described in paragraph 118 above), the Convention should be interpreted and applied in recognition of the need to deal specially with such serious challenges as are at issue in this case (see paragraph 94 above)."

Such flexibility is further circumscribed by the requirement that the arrest and detention be “reasonably considered necessary” (see paragraph 77 above and the further elaboration of this criterion affirmed in paragraph 161 below).

Article 5 § 3 includes a procedural requirement for the “judge or other officer authorised by law” to hear the individual brought before him or her in person, and a substantive requirement for the same officer to review the circumstances militating for or against detention – that is, whether there are reasons to justify detention – and to order release if there are no such reasons (see, for example, Buzadji, cited above, § 98, with further references). The initial automatic review of arrest and detention must be capable of examining lawfulness issues and whether or not the reasonable suspicion that the arrested person has committed an offence persists, or in other words, ascertaining that the detention falls within the permitted exception set out in Article 5 § 1 (c) (ibid., § 99)."

It follows directly from the wording of Article 5 § 3 that if the person is not “arrested or detained” but has been released, there is no obligation to bring him or her promptly before a judge. This understanding is supported by the reference in Lawless (cited above, § 14, quoted in paragraph 104 above) to two options when bringing a person before a judge: either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge. Moreover, as the Court pointed out in Brogan and Others (cited above, § 58):",
                "“the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3. No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released ‘promptly’ before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see the de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 25, § 52).

While promptness has to be assessed according to the special features of each case (see, among other authorities, Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ III), the strict time constraint imposed by this requirement leaves little flexibility in interpretation; otherwise there would be a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and a risk of impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision (see, for example, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 33, ECHR 2006 ‑ X)."

Thus, for example, in İpek and Others v. Turkey (nos. 17019/02 and 30070/02, §§ 36-37, 3 February 2009) and Kandzhov v. Bulgaria (no. 68294/01, §§ 66-67, 6 November 2008) the Court found that periods of three days and nine hours and three days and twenty-three hours respectively could not be considered “prompt”."

It is also relevant for the assessment of “promptness” to bear in mind that when bringing a detainee before the judge under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), the Court has held that the object of questioning during detention under this sub-paragraph is to further the criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest (see, for example, John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 55, Reports 1996 ‑ I). This implies that a certain period between the arrest and the prompt appearance before the judge may be necessary for the investigating authorities to obtain evidence to substantiate that there are reasons to justify the detention."

Such considerations do not come into play for a detainee under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) where there is no criminal investigation and no suspicion to confirm or dispel. The facts constituting the risk of committing an offence must already be established at the time when the person is detained in order to prevent his or her committing this offence. It therefore appears that the period needed between a person’s detention for preventive purposes and the person’s prompt appearance before a judge or judicial officer should be shorter than in the case of pre-trial detention in criminal proceedings. Whereas for a person deprived of his or her liberty “on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence” under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), any period in excess of four days is prima facie too long (see paragraph 131 above) a significantly shorter period might be required in order to be viewed as “prompt” in the case of a person deprived of his or her liberty outside the context of criminal proceedings “when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”."

It does not follow from the fact of resorting to preventive detention that the authorities have any intention of charging the person in question or carrying out further investigations in order to verify whether a charge can be brought. Where no criminal proceedings are initiated and no trial is to be held, the requirement in question cannot apply to preventive detention."

In view of the time-limit, they sought to avoid resorting to detention early in the day because any person so detained would otherwise have had to be released during or immediately after the match and would then have been able to head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls (see paragraph 20 above).

Turning next to the requirement in Article 5 § 1 (c) for the offence to be concrete and specific as regards, in particular, the place and time of its commission and its victim(s), the Court notes that section 5(1) and (3) of the Police Act did not specify any criminal acts which the applicants should refrain from committing."

However, as the Government pointed out in the context of hooligan brawls and the related risk of disturbance of public order and danger to the safety of individuals and public security, a number of provisions on punishable acts specified which criminal acts the applicant should refrain from committing. These included the obligation not to instigate fights or exhibit any other form of violent behaviour likely to disturb public order, as provided in section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order, a breach of which constituted a criminal offence punishable by a fine (see section 18 of the Executive Order). Moreover, Article 134a of the Penal Code set out the obligation not to take part in fights or become involved in other serious breaches of the peace in a public place where such actions took place by mutual consent or with several persons acting together; a breach of this provision was punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and six months. Finally, Articles 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code concerned, respectively, violence, aggravated violence, and the obligation to refrain from committing criminal damage."

The Court considers that the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts in the present case (see paragraphs 150-153 above) should be able to satisfy an objective observer that, at the time when the applicants were detained, the police had every reason to believe that they were organising a brawl between football hooligans in the centre of Copenhagen in the hours before, during or after the football match on 10 October 2009, which could have caused considerable danger to the safety of the many peaceful football supporters and uninvolved third parties present at the relevant time. Indeed, as it was considered that the second and third applicants and the first applicant respectively had been prevented from instigating or continuing to instigate a brawl between football hooligans at Amagertorv Square at 3.50 p.m. and in front of Tivoli Gardens at 4.45 p.m. on the relevant day, the place and time could be very precisely described. Likewise, the victims could be identified as the public present at those places at the times mentioned."

                "161. The necessity criterion that applies in respect of certain provisions of Article 5 § 1, including the first limb of sub-paragraph (c), has been mentioned in paragraph 77 above, notably the authorities’ obligation to consider “alternative means”. With a view to its examination of the preventive detention at issue in the present case, the Court considers it useful to elaborate on this criterion in respect of the second limb. In its view, less severe measures have to be considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. Preventive detention cannot reasonably be considered necessary unless a proper balance is struck between the importance in a democratic society of preventing an imminent risk of an offence being committed and the importance of the right to liberty. In order to be proportionate to such a serious measure as deprivation of liberty, the concrete and specific “offence” referred to under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) must also be of a serious nature, entailing danger to life and limb or significant material damage. It follows in addition that the detention should cease as soon as the risk has passed, which requires monitoring, the duration of the detention being also a relevant factor (on the latter point, see, for example, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 78)."

The Court further observes that according to the evidence given by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander of the police operation, to the City Court (see paragraph 21 above) the manoeuvre tactics to prevent such clashes had been to engage in proactive dialogue with the fans/spectators from 12 noon, when they started to arrive, and in the event of any clashes, to detain only the instigators. Moreover, although there were several fights up until the start of the match, the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of spectators behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. In his statement (see paragraph 22 above) Police Constable P.W. confirmed that at the beginning there had been a good atmosphere and no violence. He and a colleague had simply “kept an eye” on the Danish football fans in the bar. When they had received reports that Swedish and Danish fans were to meet and fight and the group had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square, approximately 700 metres away, where the first fight had broken out at 3.41 p.m., the police had followed the Danish group and had reported back to the control room. Chief Inspector B.O. stated that he did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty to sixty persons on either side."

Moreover, even when faced with the situation arising when a group of approximately fifty Danish football fans left the pub and went directly towards the fight at Amagertorv Square, the police initially attempted to apply less stringent measures to avoid a confrontation. They parked their personnel carriers crosswise to prevent the Danish group of football fans from colliding with the Swedish group. Thereafter, they turned the group of Danish football fans around and took them down a side street to register and search them."

As established by the national courts, it was at that moment of intense action, in the immediate vicinity of the on-going fight at Amagertorv Square, that the second and third applicants were considered inciting others to take part in the fighting. Those two applicants were therefore detained at 3.50 p.m., in full compliance with the manoeuvre tactics aimed at detaining only the instigators (see paragraph 163 above). According to Police Constable P.W. (see paragraph 22 above) the purpose of detaining those two applicants was to ensure calm and prevent clashes, an approach which apparently succeeded because it became obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus were missing someone to take control."

In the Court’s view, this shows that the police did not resort to excessive detentions, but took care to detain only those who, in their assessment, posed a risk of disturbance of public order and a danger to the safety of individuals and public security."

The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the correctness of the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.”"
