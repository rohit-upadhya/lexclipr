It reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, § 65, 15 May 2014). As such this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by the persons organising the gathering (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003-III; Ziliberberg v. Moldova ( dec. ), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004; and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, § 41, 5 March 2009)."

B.M. had been one of the leaders of the farmers ’ meeting on 16 May 2003, at which the farmers had decided to attempt to achieve their goals by organising protests next to major highways.

As a result, traffic had been blocked until 23 May 2003. The ensuing serious breach of public order had been deliberate and had to be characterised as a riot. The District Court dismissed B.M. ’ s claim that he and other farmers had acted out of necessity because the roadblock had been their last opportunity to draw the government ’ s attention to their problems. The farmers had had an alternative, namely, they could have brought complaints before the administrative courts. The farmers had themselves mentioned that alternative during the meeting of 16 May 2003 (see paragraph 14 above). The District Court further noted that a person who created a dangerous situation by his or her actions could only rely on the defence of necessity when a dangerous situation arose through negligence (Article 31 § 2 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 65 below ). However, the actions of B.M. had been deliberate and it was therefore appropriate to find him guilty of organising the riot."

The Regional Court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, public safety and public health, human dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers ’ actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order."

It noted that by driving tractors onto the highway, thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the State border - control service, and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road, the three applicants had seriously breached public order. The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness. The Regional Court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative - law offence such as a traffic violation. As to the applicants ’ argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer, A.D., had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation (see paragraph 49 above), the Regional Court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence."

On this issue, the Regional Court emphasised that the behaviour of B.M. and A.K., in guiding the actions of the other individuals involved in the protest, could not be regarded as a non-punishable expression of their opinion, because they had breached public order, thus engaging criminal liability."

In describing the scope of the offence, the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features: the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence, damaging property or otherwise breaching public order, or the commission of those actions during a gathering. For the Supreme Court, a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order, caused public violence, or damaged property. The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent ( kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia ).

France ( C ‑ 265/95, judgment of 9 December 1997 – “the Commission case” ), concerning serious incidents which occurred in the south of France. Agricultural products from Spain and Italy had been destroyed by French farmers and acts of violence and vandalism had been committed in the relevant wholesale and retail sectors. The ECJ emphasised that, in accordance with the EC Treaty, the European internal market was characterised by the abolition, between member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods. Article 30 of the Treaty prohibited, between member States, quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. Therefore, all barriers, whether direct or indirect, actual or potential, to flows of imports in intra-Community trade had to be eliminated. Article 30, read in conjunction with Article 5 of the Treaty, also applied where a member State abstained from adopting the measures required in order to deal with obstacles to the free movement of goods which were not caused by the State."

It was, however, clear that the acts of violence committed in France against agricultural products originating in other member States created obstacles to intra-Community trade in those products. The incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years; in certain cases the French authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers, the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism, committed by persons whose faces were often not covered, had been filmed by television cameras. In spite of this, only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. This was sufficient for the ECJ to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the French government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-Community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30, taken in conjunction with Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of French farmers could not justify a failure to apply Community Law correctly, as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the State could not cope. It was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might, in appropriate cases, justify non-intervention by the police; however, this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident, and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue.",

The case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the Austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the Brenner motorway, the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours. In conjunction with a pre-existing, national, generally applicable ban on holiday driving, this caused the Brenner motorway (an essential intra-Community transit route) to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days, with a short interruption of a few hours."

It went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified. It observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member State under the EC Treaty, only the objective pursued by the national authorities, namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, being relevant. Both the free movement of goods, one of the fundamental principles of the EC Treaty, and the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest.

Under these circumstances, Austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly, and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions. In this respect, the ECJ stated as follows.",

The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining the demonstration cannot as such take away that right ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 155 ).

In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v.

For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities. A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well. So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants, and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally ( see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 84, with further references )."

However, the applicants were subsequently convicted because of their role in the organisation and implementation of the roadblocks during the latter part of the demonstrations. As already indicated above, their conduct in this respect, albeit reprehensible, was not deemed to have been violent in character.

Experience shows, however, that it is impossible to attain absolute precision in the framing of laws, particularly in fields in which the situation changes according to the prevailing views of society (see, among other authorities, Ezelin, cited above, § 45). In particular, the consequences of a given action need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

In such circumstances, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should have prevailed over any resulting minimal disturbances to the free movement of goods.

Knowing that roadblocks were likely to occur, the police had prepared action plans and alternative itineraries in the vicinity of the demonstrations, thus reducing any possible disruption to the flow of goods. The farmers themselves had foreseen measures, which were fully implemented, to ensure that traffic was redirected onto secondary roads. According to the applicants, on the critical days the flow of traffic had been “even better than usual”. This was proven by the “data from posts where the roadblocks took place”.

On the contrary, the roadblocks had been symbolic and aimed at attracting the government ’ s attention. B.M. and A.K., who were respected by the farmers, had maintained order among the demonstrators. Moreover, during the roadblocks, selected representatives of the farmers were still negotiating with the government in order to reach a compromise on milk prices. The farmers had acted calmly and had taken no action that would require police special units or the army to intervene to restrain them. Their intention was not to breach public order, but to peacefully demonstrate for social justice. Only one lawsuit for civil damage, in the amount of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290), had been upheld by a court (see paragraph 45 above).

The fact that, several days before the demonstration, the Klaipėda regional police had accidentally learned about the demonstrators ’ intentions to block the roads could not be regarded as a “decent notification” allowing the authorities to take appropriate measures.

The absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11. Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what the public interest at stake was, and what risks were represented by the demonstration. The method used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 119). Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate, even though the Court acknowledged that the event could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 38-44 )."

The right to hold spontaneous demonstrations may override the obligation to give prior notification of public assemblies only in special circumstances, namely if an immediate response to a current event is warranted in the form of a demonstration. In particular, such derogation from the general rule may be justified if a delay would have rendered that response obsolete (see Éva Molnár, cited above, §§ 37-38, and Skiba, cited above)."

As indicated by the Government and not contested by the applicants, these were the country ’ s three major highways.

The Court further sees no reason to doubt the domestic courts ’ findings to the effect that the applicants were aware that the moving of the demonstration from the authorised locations onto the highways and the parking of the tractors on the Kaunas- Marijampolė - Suvalkai highway would provoke a major disruption to traffic. Having examined the material at their disposal, the domestic courts and the Kalvarija and Pasvalys police (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above) came to the conclusion that the roadblocks had created a significant inconvenience for the flow of goods vehicles and private cars, with ensuing traffic jams and long queues of vehicles. These lasted for more than forty-eight hours, as the roadblocks were lifted only on 23 May 2003. It is not normally within the province of the European Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, inter alia, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B; Vidal v.

The decision of the farmers to move onto the highways and to use the tractors could not but be an attempt to block or reduce the passage of vehicles and create chaos in order to draw attention to the farmers ’ needs. The intentional roadblocks could not but have been aimed at pressuring the government to accept the farmers ’ demands, as shown by the fact that they were lifted as soon as the demonstrators had been informed of the successful outcome of the negotiations (see paragraphs 22 and 28 above).

In Steel and Others ( cited above ) the first and second applicants had obstructed a hunt and had impeded engineering work for the construction of a motorway, respectively. In Drieman and Others (cited above ), Greenpeace activists had manoeuvred dinghies in such a way as to physically obstruct whaling, forcing the whalers to abandon their lawful exploitation of the living resources in Norway ’ s exclusive economic zone. In these two cases, the Court considered that the inflicting of sanctions ( in Steel and Others, forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment for the obstruction of the hunt and seventeen hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days ’ imprisonment for the protest against the construction of the motorway; in Drieman and Others, two days ’ detention on remand, fines convertible into imprisonment in case of default on payment and confiscation of a dinghy ) was a reaction proportionate to, inter alia, the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others. The Court considers that the same conclusion should a fortiori be reached in the present case, where the actions of the demonstrators had not been directly aimed at an activity of which they disapproved, but at the physical blocking of another activity (the use of highways by goods vehicles and private cars) which had no direct connection with the object of their protest, namely the government ’ s alleged lack of action vis-à-vis the decrease in the prices of some agricultural products."

The organisers of the demonstration ( A.K. and B.M. ) had been officially informed, in writing, of the wording of Article 283 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above), and could therefore have foreseen the possibility of being liable to prosecution if they blocked the roads.

It also reiterates that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law together with case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see the restatement of the relevant principles in Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 50, ECHR 2015). The Court further notes that in their observations before the Grand Chamber, the applicants did not specifically address the complaint that they had raised before the Chamber under Article 7 of the Convention.

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

Turkey, no. 29994/02, § 81, 7 March 2017 ). In that regard, the Court observes that on 12 July 2012, after the entry into force of Law no. 6352, the applicant was released from prison. Taking into account the provisions of Law no. 6459, on 20 June 2013 the Adana Assize Court also suspended the execution of the prison sentence he had been given following his criminal conviction under Article 314 of the Criminal Code, and later on 5 November 2013 quashed that criminal conviction."

Thus, he was deprived of his liberty for two years and eleven months within the context of the criminal proceedings brought against him. The decisions of 20 June and 5 November 2013 neither acknowledged nor afforded redress for the alleged breach of the applicant ’ s right to freedom of assembly in respect of his previous conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The Court therefore finds that, following the decisions of 20 June and 5 November 2013, the applicant did not lose his victim status to complain of a breach of Article 11 on account of his conviction (see Gülcü, cited above, § 100)."

He further asserted that the press declaration in question had aimed to criticise the conditions of detention of Abdullah Öcalan, and thus should be considered the use of freedom of expression.

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

                "46. The Court notes that it has already examined an almost identical grievance in the case of Işıkırık v. Turkey ( cited above, §§ 55-70) and found a breach of Article 11 of the Convention. In that case, having examined the application of Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code alone and in connection with Article 220 § 6 of the same Code, the Court firstly found that when applied in connection with Article 220 § 6, the criteria for a conviction under Article 314 § 2 were extensively applied to the detriment of the applicant ( ibid., § 66). It also observed that the array of acts that potentially constituted a basis for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code, were so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, did not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (ibid., § 67). The Court further observed that on account of Mr Işıkırık ’ s conviction, for acts which fell within the scope of Article 11 of Convention, there remained no distinction between him, a peaceful demonstrator, and an individual who had committed offences within the structure of the PKK. For the Court, such an extensive interpretation of a legal norm could not be justified when it had the effect of equating mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. It considered that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and, thereby, the foundations of a democratic society, had been undermined when Mr Işıkırık had been held criminally liable under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code for the mere fact of attending a public meeting and expressing his views therein (ibid., § 68). Noting that when demonstrators faced the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risked an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, the Court found that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on those who were found criminally liable on re ‑ exercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, the provision in question would also have a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (ibid., § 69). The Court as a result concluded that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code had not been “foreseeable” in its application since it did not afford the applicant the legal protection against arbitrary interference with his right under Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., § 70)."

In the light of these circumstances, the Court finds that its considerations in the above-mentioned case of Işıkırık also apply in the present case and that there is nothing in the case file that would require it to reach a different conclusion from the one reached in that case.

The applicant in reply tried to present the circumstances of the case, petitioned the judge to summon some witnesses and requested a lawyer.

[ One defendant], detained at the Yerevan City Police Department, stated that her three interrogators pointed out the lockup in the courtyard, said it was full of women, and that they would all be truncheoned that night:'Then they showed me black spots on the carpet and said it was blood. Through this kind of pressure they forced me to write that I took part in a rally and obstructed traffic.'In several cases, police did use violence: [one defendant] alleged she was hit on the head with a plastic bottle of water; [another defendant] recounted being hit with a pistol butt, then punched and kicked.",
                "In almost all cases, administrative court hearings against opposition activists were closed and cursory. Courts considered only police evidence, and did not give the defendant the opportunity to summon defence counsel or defence witnesses.",

In many cases, judges issued the harshest administrative sentence possible – fifteen days detention – to opposition activists. Some judges at [the Kentron and Nork-Marash District of Yerevan] were frank with defendants about their one-sentence-fits-all-policy. A judge told [one defendant]:'Those who took part in the rally – we are giving them all fifteen days .'When [another defendant] asked a judge to consider handing him a shorter sentence, the latter replied that:'his instructions were to put us all away for fifteen days – no less .'Judges'questioning of several defendants was blatantly political, such as:'Why do you play at opposition?'and,'Why do you bad-mouth the government?'They warned some not to participate in opposition rallies again.",

During the week of [22-28 February 2003 ], when [the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan] tried nearly one hundred [main opposition candidate] supporters,'Red Berets'– police commandos – sealed off the building to the public. The chairman of the court acknowledged that their deployment was an initiative of the police leadership on which the court was not consulted ...",

                "In the absence of public scrutiny or defence counsel, judges applied sloppy or arbitrary reasoning in their examination of cases, or none whatsoever.",
                "In most cases, hearings lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes, and the written judgments were pre-prepared. The judge started [one defendant's] hearing by reading out his sentence – fifteen days detention for having participated in an unauthorised march. When [the defendant] objected that he had not participated in the march, he related,'The judge just said,'It is proven'and called a policeman to take me away. '",
                "While some judges alluded to the existence of proof without feeling it necessary to present it, others floated hypotheses, such as:'You took part in an unauthorised rally, and you committed acts of hooliganism on Mashtots Avenue. You shouted or broke something, is that right?'In other hearings, judges did not advance any arguments. Two [opposition] party activists from the Shengavit district of Yerevan were each given three days'detention without learning what they were charged with, while a judge quelled [another defendant's] objection to the absence of stated information or grounds for his fifteen-day sentence with the comment:'Just say thank you that we didn't press a criminal charge.

On [22 February ] 2003 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan] handed out some administrative detention sentences without conducting hearings in the presence of defendants. At least one police van with several detained activists inside was seen to drive up to the court, where a court official emerged and reportedly handed prepared judgments to the escorting police officers. The van then drove away without the defendants having set foot in court ... ”",

            ],

                "33. The Government claimed that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies in respect of the decision of 7 April 2003, as required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. According to Article 286 of the CAO, the court's decision to impose an administrative penalty was final and not subject to appeal except for the cases prescribed by law. Such an exception in respect of cases concerning offences under Article 172 of the CAO was provided by Article 294 of the CAO. This Article prescribed two possibilities to have the court's decision quashed, either by requesting the prosecutor to lodge a protest or by lodging an appeal directly with the chairman of a superior court. Thus, if a party had applied to a prosecutor but the latter refused to lodge a protest, then this party was entitled to appeal to the chairman of a superior court. Moreover, a party was entitled to appeal immediately to the chairman of a superior court without having first applied to a prosecutor. The applicant was informed about this possibility, since the decision of 7 April 2003 stated that “it was subject to review by the Chairman of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal”. However, he used only the first of these two possibilities and did not apply to the Chairman."
            ],
            [
                "34. The applicant did not accept the Government's objection. First, he argued that it was not clear from the wording of Article 294 of the CAO to the chairman of which “ superior ” court he should, according to the Government, have applied, since the division of courts into superior and inferior was an inherent element of the Soviet court system and no longer existed in Armenia. Even assuming that the phrase “superior court” implied the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal, neither Article 294 nor any other article of the CAO prescribed a right of the convicted person to lodge an appeal against the court's decision imposing administrative detention. From the wording of Article 294 it might as well be inferred that the chairman of the superior court could review such decisions of his own motion, a procedure which was not uncommon to the Soviet court system. Had this Article afforded a right to appeal as opposed to a power of review, then such an appeal would have lain with the panel of three judges of a court of appeal rather than its chairman, if this procedure was to comply with the general procedural rules applied in Armenia in the context of both criminal and civil proceedings."

            [
                "35. Second, the applicant contended that Article 294 prescribed a review of a final decision either by the judge himself upon the prosecutor's protest or, whether or not such a protest was lodged, by the chairman of the superior court. These were two equal avenues of judicial protection and the aggrieved individual had the right to choose one of them and was not obliged to pursue both of them simultaneously or one after another. In any event, he was not obliged to exhaust remedies which were not effective and adequate according to the generally recognised rules of international law. An application to the chairman of the superior court under Article 294 would have not been such a remedy, since many similar applications lodged by other individuals who had been subjected to administrative penalties for participation in the rallies of protest in the period following the presidential election proved to be unsuccessful."

The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring a case against the State before an international judicial body to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system, thus dispensing States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria no. 24760/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-VIII)."

Furthermore, under Article 35 the existence of remedies which are available and sufficient must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, e.g., De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 19, § 39; and Vernillo v. France, judgment of 20 February 1991, Series A no. 198, pp. 11 - 12, § 27 ). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, p. 1211, § 68 )."

The Court further recalls its extensive case-law to the effect that an application for retrial or similar extraordinary remedies cannot, as a general rule, be taken into account for the purposes of applying Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see, e.g., R. v. Denmark, no. 10326/83, Commission decision of 6 September 1983, Decisions and Reports (DR) 35, p. 218; Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002; and Denisov v. Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004 ). Furthermore, remedies the use of which depend on the discretionary powers of public officials cannot be considered as effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention ( see Tumilovich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47033/99, 2 June 1999; Gurepka v. Ukraine, no. 61406/00, § 60, 6 September 2005 ). Nor can remedies which have no precise time-limits, thus creating uncertainty and rendering nugatory the six-month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which is closely interrelated with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (see Berdzenishvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, 29 January 2004; Denisov, cited above )."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that Article 286 of the CAO explicitly states that the court's (judge's) decision to impose an administrative penalty is “final and not subject to appeal”. Article 294 of the CAO further provides that it “can be quashed or modified by the judge himself upon a protest of the prosecutor and, whether or not such a protest is lodged, by the chairman of the superior court”. The Court considers first of all that, as regards the possibility of applying to a prosecutor with a request to lodge a protest, this is clearly not an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention since it is not directly accessible to a party and depends on the discretionary powers of a prosecutor."

            [
                "41. As regards the review carried out by the chairman of the superior court, the parties disagreed as to whether this review was carried out upon an appeal of an interested party or of the chairman's own motion. The Court notes from the outset that no further details of this procedure are provided by the CAO. It is true that Article 286 allows for exceptions. However, contrary to what the Government claim, nothing suggests that Article 294 can be considered as such exception. Indeed, the wording used in this Article, namely “can be quashed or modified by the chairman”, as opposed to “an appeal can be lodged against”, which is the wording used in Armenia in the context of both criminal and civil procedure, suggests that this Article provides for a power of review rather than a right to appeal. The Court further notes that the application of this procedure in practice also appears to be inconsistent : while the decision of 7 April 2003 states that “it is subject to review by the Chairman”, many other similar court decisions – copies of which were submitted by the applicant – state that they “are final and not subject to appeal” or “can be protested against by the prosecutor”. The Government, in their turn, failed to submit any evidence in support of their interpretation of Article 294. In such circumstances, the Court does not find the Government's interpretation to be convincing and considers that Article 294 of the CAO provided for a power of review by the chairman rather than a right of a party to appeal. Even assuming that a party – just as in the case of applying to a prosecutor – could solicit such a review, nothing suggests that the chairman was obliged to act upon the party's relevant request. Moreover, neither the CAO nor the decision of 7 April 2003 itself prescribed any time-limits for this review."

Furthermore, safeguards of the independence of judges, such as security of judge's tenure, their irremovability and freedom from outside instructions or pressure, were guaranteed by the Constitution and the implementing legislation. In the Court's opinion, these safeguards were sufficient to exclude the applicant's misgivings about the independence of the tribunal in his case."

The applicant was brought to the police station at 17 h 30, while the court hearing took place at 19 h 30. During this time he failed to avail himself of his procedural rights, despite all the efforts of the police officers. The applicant was familiarised with the materials of the case against him and informed about his right to lodge motions and challenges, which he failed to do. The applicant signed the record of an administrative offence voluntarily and, by doing so, he agreed with its content and in essence admitted his guilt. Taking into account that the applicant signed the record, refused to have a lawyer, did not lodge any motions and did not avail himself of other procedural rights, the police officers considered two hours to be sufficient for the preparation of the applicant's defence. Furthermore, the applicant had the right to request an adjournment of the examination of his case, which he also failed to do. By failing to request such an adjournment, the applicant admitted that he had had ample time to prepare his defence.

The police as a rule were looking for their “victims” not at the demonstration but at a later hour and at a different location. Often the public and close relatives became aware of the conviction only after the court decision had been taken and the convicted person had already been placed in the detention facility.

Despite the fact that the Government did not explicitly dispute this submission, the Court considers that compelling evidence would be required to convince it that a certain official document is a fake. It is true that the record was drawn up in a calligraphic handwriting, which prompts the Court to believe that it was possibly drafted – or at least re-drafted – at some point after the hearing. While this may raise some doubts as to the accuracy of the record, it is nevertheless not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the record is a fake. The Court will therefore proceed on the assumption that the trial was conducted in the manner described in this record, from which it appears that there was a court examination, even if a very brief one."

The applicant claimed that the court had based its decision on the materials prepared by the police, namely the record of an administrative offence, and ignored all his arguments. The Court recalls, however, that it is not within its province to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among many other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247 ‑ B, pp. 34-35, § 34; Bernard v. France, judgment of 23 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ II, p. 879, § 37). Furthermore, while Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law. It is therefore not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected. It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubts on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 5 4810/00, §§ 94- 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... )."

In the Court's opinion, the fact that the only evidence in criminal proceedings is the witness testimony of an arresting police officer is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention, as long as the accused has the opportunity to test this evidence in adversarial proceedings. In the present case, the applicant – even if at a very brief hearing – was able to make submissions in defence of his position. On the other hand, none of the arresting police officers was called and examined in court. In this connection, the Court recalls, however, that the right to examine a witness can only be exercised if the accused has expressed his wish to do so (see Cardot v. France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, pp. 18-19, §§ 35-36), something which the applicant failed to do."

                "79. The applicant further claimed that the tribunal was not impartial. The Court recalls that the requirement of “impartiality” enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention has two aspects. Firstly, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Gautrin and Others v. France, judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, pp. 1030-31, § 58; Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 38784/97, § 58, ECHR 2002 ‑ I). As to the subjective test, the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 47; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). In the present case, the applicant alleged that the judge was biased for political reasons. In this respect, the Court considers that – while some of the materials in the case, such as the PACE documents and the Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, suggest that the period surrounding the presidential election of 2003 was a period of increased political sensitivity – it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the judge examining the applicant's particular case was personally biased for political grounds.

The Court reiterates that the public character of court hearings constitutes a fundamental principle enshrined in Article 6 § 1 (see, among other authorities, Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, § 58). The accused's right to a public hearing is not only an additional guarantee that an endeavour will be made to establish the truth but also helps to ensure that he is satisfied that his case is being determined by a tribunal whose independence and impartiality he may verify. The public character of proceedings before judicial bodies protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts, superior and inferior, can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Fejde v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212 ‑ C, pp. 67-68, § 28; Tierce and Others v. San Marino, nos. 24954/94, 24971/94 and 24972/94, § 92, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX)."

                "81. In the present case, the Court notes at the outset that the hearing in question was formally public. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, Sukhorubchenko v. Russia, no. 69315/01, § 43, 10 February 2005). The Court considers that the right to a public hearing would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed courts to hold hearings which were public in form but would not be in reality accessible to the public, including because of the time and location of the hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, § 29-31, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII). The Court notes, however, that it is not evident from the record of the court hearing at what time the applicant's trial was conducted. Nor did the applicant produce any other evidence which could support his allegation that this hearing took place at 23h00. It is therefore objectively impossible to establish the time of the court hearing and whether this precluded the hearing from being public. As regards the place of the hearing, it is true that the Government did not explicitly contest the applicant's allegation that the hearing in question took place in judge M.'s office as opposed to a courtroom (see paragraph 21 above). However, it follows from the record of the court hearing that the judge at a certain moment departed to a deliberation room, which suggests that the hearing was most likely held in a courtroom rather than an office. Furthermore, the fact that no members of the public were present at the hearing does not automatically render it not public. The Court finally notes that the applicant did not submit any arguments other than solely relying on the alleged time and location of the hearing in support of his allegation that it was not public. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the hearing in question was not public."

Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission's report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, § 53; Connolly v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27245/95, 26 June 1996; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 78, 20 January 200 5). Furthermore, the facilities which everyone charged with a criminal offence should enjoy include the opportunity to acquaint himself for the purposes of preparing his defence with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands, (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997; Foucher v.

In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant's case was examined in an expedited procedure under the CAO: according to Article 277 of the CAO, cases concerning offences of minor hooliganism were to be examined within one day. The Court recalls, however, that the existence and utilisation of expeditious proceedings in criminal matters is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as long as they provide the necessary safeguards and guarantees contained therein (see Borisova, cited above ). The Government claimed that it was open to the applicant to seek an adjournment of his case, if he considered the time afforded to him for the preparation of his defence to be insufficient, which he failed to do. The Court notes, however, that the CAO does not prescribe any exceptions to the rule contained in the above Article 277. Nor is the right to seek adjournment explicitly listed among the rights enjoyed by an accused in administrative proceedings (Article 267 of the CAO). The Government also failed to invoke any legal basis for such a right. Furthermore, neither the materials of the applicant's administrative case, nor the Government themselves, suggest that the applicant was made aware of the existence of such a possibility by the police officers or the court. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the Government have failed to demonstrate convincingly that the applicant unequivocally enjoyed, both in law and in practice, the right to have the examination of his case adjourned in order to prepare his defence and that such an adjournment would have possibly been granted, had the applicant made a relevant request (see, a contrario, Murphy, cited above)."

The Government claimed that, since the applicant's case was not a complex one, two hours had been sufficient, taking into account that he had refused to have a lawyer, had not availed himself of his right to lodge motions and challenges, and had voluntarily signed the record of an administrative offence. The Court considers, however, that the mere fact that the applicant signed a paper in which he stated that he did not wish to have a lawyer and chose to defend himself in person does not mean that he did not need to be afforded adequate time and facilities to prepare himself effectively for trial. Nor does the fact that the applicant did not lodge any specific motions during the short pre-trial period necessarily imply that no further time was needed for him to be able – in adequate conditions – to properly assess the charge against him and to consider various avenues to defend himself effectively. Finally, the Court agrees that the applicant had the choice of refusing to sign the record of an administrative offence. However, contrary to what the Government claim, nothing in law or in the materials of the applicant's administrative case suggests that the applicant's signing of the record pursued any other purpose than confirming the fact of him having been familiarised with it and made aware of his rights and the charge against him."

The parties disagreed as regards the exact length of the pre-trial period but, in any event, it is evident that this period was not longer than a few hours. The Court further notes that during this time the applicant was either in transit to the court or was being kept in the police station without any contact with the outside world. Furthermore, during this short stay at the police station, the applicant was subjected to a number of investigative activities, including questioning and a search. Even if it is accepted that the applicant's case was not a complex one, the Court doubts that the circumstances in which the applicant's trial was conducted – from the moment of his arrest up until his conviction – were such as to enable him to familiarise himself properly with and to assess adequately the charge and evidence against him, and to develop a viable legal strategy for his defence."

The Court reiterates that, although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial ( see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 89, ECHR 2001-II ). Furthermore, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia v.

The manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I, pp. 54-55, § 63; Öcalan, cited above, § 131). The Court further recalls that the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial includes, in general, not only the right to be present, but also the right to receive legal assistance, if necessary ( see Lagerblom v.

The Court notes that all the materials before it indicate that the applicant expressly waived his right to be represented by a lawyer both before and during the court hearing (see paragraphs 14 and 20 above). While the nature of some of the rights safeguarded by the Convention is such as to exclude a waiver of the entitlement to exercise them (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp, cited above, p. 36, § 65), the same cannot be said of certain other rights (see Albert and Le Compte, cited above, p. 19, § 35). It is clear from the text of Article 6 § 3 (c) that an accused has the choice of defending himself either “in person or through legal assistance”. Thus, it will normally not be contrary to the requirements of this Article if an accused is self-represented in accordance with his own will, unless the interests of justice require otherwise. In the present case, there is no evidence that the applicant's choice to be self-represented was the result of any threats or physical violence. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the applicant's allegation that he was “tricked” into refusing a lawyer. Even though the PACE and Human Rights Watch reports referred to in paragraph 79 above contain relevant information, these materials are, nevertheless, not sufficient for the Court to conclude that actions, similar to the ones described in these reports, happened in the applicant's particular case. Finally, noting that the applicant was accused of a minor offence and the maximum possible sentence could not exceed 15 days of detention, the Court does not discern in the present case any interests of justice which would have required a mandatory legal representation."

Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction's compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

Furthermore, the imposition of a sanction for participation in an unauthorised demonstration is similarly considered to be compatible with the guarantees of Article 11 (see Ziliberberg, cited above ). On the other hand, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as this person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, p. 23, § 53)."

Neither this decision, nor the materials prepared by the police, provide any further details as to the circumstances under which these actions were committed. On the other hand, it is apparent from the police report that the street where the demonstration took place, namely the Mashtots Avenue, was packed with a great number of people (see paragraph 11 above), and the Government did not dispute that the street traffic had been suspended by the traffic police prior to the commencement of the demonstration (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, as already indicated above, the authorities did not make any attempts to disperse the participants in the demonstration on account of unlawful obstruction of traffic (see paragraph 101 above). It follows that the “obstruction of street traffic”, which the applicant was found guilty of, amounted to his physical presence at a demonstration held on a street where traffic had already been suspended beforehand by the authorities with the apparent intention of facilitating the conduct of a lawful demonstration. As to the loud noise made by the applicant, there is no suggestion that this noise involved any obscenity or incitement to violence. The Court, however, finds it hard to imagine a huge political demonstration, at which people express their opinion, not generating a certain amount of noise."

In this respect, the Court considers that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly would be impaired, if the State was not to prohibit a demonstration but was then to impose sanctions, especially such severe ones, on its participants for the mere fact of attending it, without committing anything reprehensible, as happened in the applicant's case.

It follows accordingly that as regards the alleged events of 19 ‑ 20 June 2006, the last domestic decision for the purposes of the calculation of the six - month time-limit was the prosecutorial ruling of 29 July 2006 in which the applicants ’ complaints regarding the events of 19-20 June 2006 had been disregarded.

Freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of Article 10, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those which offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see, e.g., Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, § 57, Series A no. 204). Although freedom of expression may be subject to exceptions, they “must be narrowly interpreted” and “the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established” (see, e.g., Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 59, Series A no. 216).

The Court also notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 or 11 § 2 is not synonymous with “indispensable”, it remains for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of “necessity” in this context (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

In such circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that Article 11 is to be regarded as a lex specialis and that it is unnecessary to take the complaint under Article 10 into consideration separately (see, in this connection, Primov and Others v.

During the first phase of their protest on that day they gathered, as duly authorised by the University administration, in one of the lecture halls (see paragraph 11 above). They moved, however, soon afterwards to the acting Rector ’ s office, protesting against the ongoing University reform and demanding his resignation. The events which developed subsequent to their unauthorised entry to the Rector ’ s office do not represent, in the Court ’ s view, a standard situation of a “peaceful assembly” within the meaning of Article 11 of the Convention. As noted in Kudrevičius and Others, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention ( cited above, paragraph 97; see also Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no. 31475/10, §§ 123-128, 25 July 2017). Nevertheless, the Court notes that the applicants were not held responsible for using violence. While the events at issue happened in a situation of tension, the applicants ’ conduct was not established to have been of a violent nature. The Court thus does not consider that the applicants ’ protest on 3 July 2006, viewed as a whole, was of such a nature and degree as to exclude them from the scope of protection under Article 11 of the Convention, read in the light of Article 10."

The Government claimed that the applicants ’ removal with the involvement of the police had had a legal basis in the Law on the Police and the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations, and had been aimed at preventing further disruption to public order, as well as the protection of the rights of G.Kh. and others. The Court accepts that the impugned interference had a basis in domestic law. It notes that the police acted at the request of the acting Rector of the University (see paragraph 65 above). The removal was preceded by G.Kh. and other administrative staff members, and then by the police, explicitly and repeatedly asking the applicants to leave the acting Rector ’ s office. It therefore finds that the requirement of lawfulness is satisfied."

As to whether the interference in question had a legitimate aim, the Court accepts the Government ’ s argument that given the circumstances of the current case, the impugned interference pursued the legitimate aims of preventing public disorder and protecting the rights of others. It notes in this connection the national court ’ s conclusion according to which on 3 July 2006, after the impugned “ election ” of the second applicant as the new Rector of the University, the situation at the University escalated, with the applicants entering by force the office of the acting Rector and many more protesters chanting anti-G.Kh. slogans in the corridor of the University and in its courtyard (see paragraph 42 above). Although the parties disagree as to the extent of the disruption that the applicants ’ protest caused to the University, the Court is of the opinion that in view of the scale and duration of the protest, also having regard to the content of the video recording at the disposal of the Court, the disruption to the work of the University was noticeable. As the Tbilisi City Court concluded, the behaviour of the applicants − intensified by the number of protesters in the corridors of the building – intimidated the employees and students and disrupted the normal functioning of the educational establishment. At the same time, the applicants ’ protest at the very least impeded the work of the acting Rector and his immediate colleagues for about two hours. Against this background, the Court accepts the domestic court ’ s conclusion that the decision of the police to remove the applicants and other protesters from G.Kh. ’ s office was justified by the demands of public order and the interests of others (see Taranenko, and Açık and Others, both cited above, § § 78-79 and § 45 respectively; see also Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 97, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII )."

As to the necessity in a democratic society of the interference at issue, it is true that the applicants by means of their protest wished to draw the attention of the University staff and the general public to their disapproval of the ongoing reforms at the University and their demand for the resignation of G.Kh. This was a topic of public interest at the material time and there was little scope under Articles 10 § 2 and 11 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate relating thereto (see Taranenko, cited above, § 77, and Murat Vural v. Turkey, no. 9540/07, § 52, 21 October 2014). The Court notes, however, that the applicants were allowed to proceed, uninterruptedly, with a pre-authorised gathering in the Grand Hall of the main University building on the very same day for several hours (see paragraph 11 above). Subsequently, they had protested for about two hours in the office of the acting Rector, and the administration of the University ( including the acting Rector ) − and subsequently the police − showed the necessary tolerance (compare Kakabadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 1484/07, § 88, 2 October 2012; Açık and Others, cited above, § 46; and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV). No physical force was used by the police against the applicants. Instead, as established in the course of the domestic proceedings, police officers negotiated with the applicants for more than an hour for their peaceful removal from G.Kh. ’ s office ( contrast Açık and Others, cited above, § 46). Moreover, after their removal from the office of the acting Rector, they were allowed to stay on the premises of the University and continue with their protest."

As to the allegations of insulting harassment, the national courts established that the applicants had forced their way into G.Kh. ’ s office, calling for his resignation and demanding in an insulting manner that he leave his office, “bag and baggage” (see ibid. ). In the Court ’ s view, in calling for the resignation of a public official the applicants were exercising their right to freedom of expression (see, in this connection, Kandzhov v. Bulgaria, no. 68294/01, § 70, 6 November 2008). Their call for the acting Rector ’ s resignation could not in and of itself have been deemed to be insulting. The domestic courts did not identify any specific insulting phrases that the applicants had used with respect to G.Kh. or his colleagues ( compare Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, §§ 26 ‑ 27, 27 May 2003; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 32, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; and Kakabadze and Others, cited above, §§ 88-89 ).

Indeed, Article 166 of the CAO, along with “[causing] offensive annoyance to a person”, refers to other similar actions which disturb public order and peace (see paragraph 47 above ). The Court accepts in this connection the conclusion of the domestic courts that any place, whatever its legal status or function, may become by virtue of the presence of a group of persons a public space within the meaning of Article 166 of the CAO (see paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicants ’ conduct did indeed disrupt public order on the premises of the University (see the conclusion of the Court reached in paragraph 78 above). The Court is thus of the opinion that the interpretation of this provision given by the domestic courts in the present case was not arbitrary, and that the applicants could have foreseen, to a degree reasonable in the circumstances, that their actions entailing disruption to the functioning of the University, could have been deemed to amount to a minor breach of public order attracting the application of Article 166 of the CAO."

The refusal for about one hour of the applicants to obey the police officers ’ reiterated requests was deemed by the domestic court to have constituted resistance to a lawful order issued by the police within the meaning of Article 173 of the CAO, notwithstanding the fact that at the end of those negotiations the applicants left the office voluntarily."

The Court furthermore notes that, as already established above, the legitimate aim of the interference was the prevention of disruption to public order and to the interests of others. It remains to be seen whether the interference in the light of the case as a whole was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient."

The Court reiterates that the purpose of the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity to prevent or put right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court. Consequently, States do not have to answer for their actions before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999 ‑ V, with further references therein). The Court notes that in the current case the applicants did not even once at the domestic level voice their grievances concerning the press conference given by the Minister of Education. They could have done so within the context of the impugned administrative proceedings (see, for example, Fatullayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 40984/07, § 153, 22 April 2010) or, as proposed by the Government, by lodging a civil complaint (see, for example, Martin Babjak and Others v.

While it is true that in the absence of any domestic case-law concerning Article 18 § 2 of the Civil Code, the Court is not in a position to conclude that that remedy was indeed available and effective in practice, it still finds unacceptable the applicants ’ failure to complain at the domestic level about the alleged violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence. By not giving the Government an opportunity to address this complaint at the domestic level, the applicants in the Court ’ s view did not meet the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.

Thus, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Blokhin v.

Furthermore, given that the Court ’ s concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, it must review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the evidence given by an absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the accused ’ s conviction. It must also do so in those cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was the sole or decisive basis but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and that its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness.

Starting with the administrative offence of resistance to the police, the Court notes that Ms Sikharulidze and Mr Bakhtadze (the sixth and ninth applicants) were acquitted of that offence since it was established that they had left the office of the acting Rector before the arrival of the police (see paragraph 39 above); the remaining applicants never challenged the official version of events regarding their encounter with the police officers in G.Kh. ’ s office – they merely maintained that there had been no physical confrontation. However, the domestic courts concluded that even in the absence of a physical confrontation, those of the applicants who had remained in the Rector ’ s office had refused to obey the official orders of the police, and that refusal had amounted to the offence of resisting the police (see paragraph 39 above).

The report stated that the march, in which around 8,000 people had participated, had begun at 4.15 p.m. and had followed the route to Bolotnaya Square. It listed the groups and organisations represented, the number of participants in each group, the number and colours of their flags and the number and content of their banners.

The police ... ordered them to proceed to Bolotnaya Square, the venue of the meeting. However, the leaders at the head of the procession – [Mr Udaltsov, Mr Nemtsov and Mr Navalnyy ] – ... called on the marchers through the loudspeaker not to move. Together with some thirty protesters they sat on the ground. Another group of around twenty, called by [their leaders], followed suit. The police ... repeatedly warned them against holding an unauthorised public gathering and required them to proceed to the venue of the meeting or to leave. Besides that, two State Duma deputies, Gennady Gudkov and Dmitry Gudkov, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Lukin, and a member of the Civic Chamber, Nikolay Svanidze, talked to them, but those sitting on the ground did not react and continued chanting slogans ... From 5.58 p.m. to 7 p.m. persons on Malyy Kamennyy Bridge and Bolotnaya Embankment made attempts to break the cordon, and threw empty glass bottles, fireworks, chunks of tarmac and portable metal barriers at the police officers. From 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. music was playing on the stage ... At 5.20 p.m. ... a deputy of the Vologda Regional Duma called on the participants to head to the Malyy Kamennyy Bridge to support those sitting on the ground ... At 6 p.m. one of the organisers, Ms Mityushkina ..., went on the stage and declared the meeting over. At 6.20 p.m. Mr Udaltsov went on the stage and called on the people to take part in an indefinite protest action.",

The Expert Commission comprised six international experts whose objective was to provide an independent fact-finding and legal assessment of the circumstances in which the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square had been dispersed. In 2013 the Expert Commission produced a fifty-three-page report containing the chronology and an assessment of the events of 6 May 2012. It identified the sources used for the report as follows.",

Participants were to assemble at Kaluzhskaya Square, set off at 4:00pm along Bolshaya Yakimanka and Bolshaya Polyanka for a rally in Bolotnaya Square, and disperse at 7:30pm The official notification of approval was issued on [4 May 2012] – just two days before the beginning of the event.",

This was the same procedure [the] authorities [had] adopted for the two previous rallies on Bolotnaya Square on [10 December 2011] and [4 February 2012].",
                "On the evening of [5 May 2012], [the] police cordoned off the public gardens at Bolotnaya Square. According to Colonel Yuri Zdorenko, who was responsible for security at the location, this was done ‘ in order to prevent the participants from setting up camp and from [carrying out] other [illegal] acts. ’ [The] authorities received information [that] the protesters might attempt to establish a protest camp at the site, causing them to decide that the rally should be confined to only the Bolotnaya waterfront area – a much smaller area than had been originally allocated for the assembly.",
                "The police did not, however, inform the organisers of the changes they had decided upon, and they only became aware of the police-imposed changes to the event when they arrived at the site on the afternoon of [6 May 2012].",

Furthermore, at 1:30pm, the police did not allow vehicles with stage equipment onto the site until they had been searched. The searches revealed a small number of tents, and [the] authorities detained a number of people as a result.

The police established a triple cordon of officers on Bolshoy Kammeny Bridge, which prevented any movement in the direction of the Kremlin. The first cordon was positioned close to the junction of Maly Kamenny Bridge and the Bolotnaya waterfront. Students from the Police College and officers of the Patrol Guard Service (without any protective equipment) made up this line. Behind them were two rows of OMON [riot police], a line of voluntary citizen patrol ( ‘ druzhinniki ’ ), and another cordon of OMON. A number of water cannons were visible between the second and third cordons.",
                "[The report contained two photographs comparing the police cordon on 4 February 2012, a thin line of police officers without protection gear, and the one on 6 May 2012, multiple ranks of riot police with full protection gear backed up by heavy vehicles.]",
                "The police cordons, which blocked off movement in the direction of the Kremlin, created a bottleneck that slowed the march ’ s progress to such an extent that it came to a virtual stop as demonstrators attempted to cross the bridge. Moreover, just beyond Luzhkov Bridge, the marchers had to go through a second set of metal detectors, where progress was very slow since there were only 14 detectors.",
                "By 5:15pm, the majority of the march was immobile. A number of leaders, including Sergey Udaltsov, Alexey Navalnyy and Ilya Yashin, encouraged demonstrators to sit down on the road in front of the ‘ Udarnik ’ cinema facing the police cordon to protest [against] the inability of the march to continue and to demand that they be given access to the originally allocated space for the rally on Bolotnaya Square. An estimated 50-200 people joined the sit-down protest. The leaders stressed the need to maintain a peaceful protest and appealed to demonstrators to remain calm. Participants chanted, ‘ We will not go away ’ and ‘ Police together with the people ’. The leaders attempted to address the crowds using loudspeakers, but those behind the sit-down protest could not hear or see events as they transpired. The sit-down protest did not completely block the road, but it did restrict the movement of those approaching the police lines and the bottleneck caused by the police cordon. As a result, the crowd grew denser as more demonstrators arrived from Bolshaya Yakimanka Street.",

                "‘ The organizers of the rally and other participants refuse to proceed to the agreed place of the rally (to Bolotnaya Square). They [have] stopped on the roadway near the ‘ Udarnik ’ theatre. Some of them [have] sat on the ground and thus blocked the movement of the column. Despite repeated warnings on the part of the police to proceed to the place of the rally, they won ’ t move thereby creating a real threat of a jam and trauma for participants. An inquiry commission is working on the spot to document their actions related to appeals to commit mass public disorder with a view to further consider the issue of instituting criminal proceedings. ’",

Some tried to pass through the police cordon to leave the area, but the police refused to let them through. Instead, they were directed to go back through the crowd to Bolshaya Polyanka Street, even though this was practically impossible.",
                "The police used loud speakers to inform demonstrators of the rally location. They asked participants to pass directly to Bolotnaya Square and not stop at the bridge, despite the fact that the major part of the square was closed to demonstrators. They announced that all actions on the bridge could be considered illegal. However, given the poor quality of the sound equipment, only those nearest the police could hear this information; the majority of protesters did not hear the police instructions.",

This in turn generated a counter response from the crowd, and protesters began pushing back. In several places, the police cordon broke, and a few dozen people found themselves in the empty space behind the first police line. It is impossible to determine whether the [breaking of the cordon] was the result of conscious action by sections of the crowd or if the police cordon simply broke due to the pressure from such a large number of people.",
                "Some of those who made it past the police lines were young men, but there were also many elderly citizens and others who did not resemble street fighters. Those who found themselves behind the police cordon did not act in an aggressive manner but appeared to move towards the entrance to the Bolotnaya [park], the supposed rally point.",

Some tried to move away, others called for people to break the cordon, while some tried to restrain the crowd from [trampling on] those who were still taking part in the sit-down protest. As pressure and tension grew, the sit-down protesters stood up rather than risk being trampled. There was a high degree of confusion, and people were not clear on what was happening.",
                "Just after the [breaking of the police cordon] at approximately at 6:00pm, a single Molotov cocktail was thrown from the crowd. It landed behind the police ranks and ignited the trousers of ... a 74-year-old demonstrator who had passed through the cordon. The police used their fire extinguishers to put out the fire. This was the only such incident recorded during the day ...",
                "Soon after the cordons were broken, the authorities began to detain those who remained behind the police lines, taking them to special holding areas. The police also arrested some protesters at the front of the crowd who had not tried to break through the cordon. The police cordon was fully restored after about four minutes. ...",

A police cordon blocked access to the stage, but they were allowed through. As they tried to start the rally, the police intervened. ...",
                "... OMON officers then detained Sergey Udaltsov on stage and shortly afterwards detained Boris Nemtsov and Alexey Navalnyy as well. By 6:50pm, the organizers began to disassemble the stage.",
                "In the two hours between 6pm and 8pm, the demonstration was marked by two distinct types of activity. For much of the time, demonstrators and the police stood face to face without much happening. These moments were interspersed with periods when the police advanced and the crowd moved back. There does not appear to have been any clear reason for the police decision to advance other than to divide the crowd up into smaller sections. More than anything, the police advances served to raise tensions and provoke some members of the crowd to push back. There is little evidence that demonstrators initiated the violence. Rather, they appear to have become aggressive only in response to the authorities ’ advances.",

Police used a loudspeaker to state, ‘ Dear citizens, we earnestly ask you not to disturb public order! Otherwise, in accordance with the law, we will have to use force! Please, leave here, and do not stop. Go to the metro. ’ Although the police used a loudspeaker, the announcement was not loud enough to reach the majority of the crowd. It is likely that only those nearest to the loudspeakers could have heard the call to disperse.",

At the same time, police began to push people back along the Bolotnaya waterfront from the Luzhkov Bridge towards the Udarnik cinema. Those who remained on the waterfront linked arms in passive resistance. The police pushed forward, divided the crowd and began to detain demonstrators.",

On 20 March 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy branch of the Investigative Committee dismissed ten individual complaints and two official enquiries made in relation to the matter, one by Mr I. Ponomarev, a deputy of the State Duma, and another one by Mr A. Babushkin, President of the Public Supervisory Committee of Moscow. The complaints and enquiries concerned the allegedly unlawful acts of the police in dispersing the rally on 6 May 2012, including excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests. The Investigative Committee interviewed one of the ten individuals who had lodged the complaints and four police officers deployed in the cordon around Bolotnaya Square, including squadron and regiment commanders. They stated, in particular, that they had been acting under orders to maintain public safety and to identify and arrest the most active instigators of unrest; only those resisting the demands of the police had been arrested and no force had been used unnecessarily. The police officers stated that when the police had had to intervene, they had used combat manoeuvres and truncheons but not tear gas or other exceptional means of restraint. Squadron Commander S. explained that he had been deployed in the sector adjacent to the stage and that there had been no incidents or disorder in that sector; no one had been arrested. The decision listed thirteen other internal inquiries carried out following individual complaints and medical reports; in six cases the allegations of abuse had been found to be unsubstantiated and in seven cases the police conduct had been found to be lawful. As regards the substance of the complaints at hand, the Investigative Committee found as follows.",
                "“... having crossed Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, the column leaders stopped. Many participants in the march bypassed the organisers and proceeded to Bolotnaya Square towards the stage ... When the march participants had filled nearly all of Bolotnaya Embankment, limited by the police cordon on one side and by the stage on the other side, the organisers were still at the point between Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, Bolotnaya Square, [the park] and the Udarnik cinema ...",
                "At this time the organisers demanded that the police officers let them pass through to the Kremlin. The police told them that they would not let anyone pass through to the Kremlin because the event was authorised to take place at Bolotnaya Square, where the stage had been specially set up, and they were told to proceed. After that, the organisers decided to call a sit-down protest and called upon those present to disobey the lawful orders of the police. After that, the meeting participants congregated opposite the Udarnik cinema, where after a while they attempted to break the cordon, which [the police] did not manage to prevent. Therefore the police began arresting those who had been most actively involved in breaking the cordon; they were put in a police van and then taken to police stations in Moscow. After the confrontation had been localised, the police officers slightly dispersed the crowd, having apprehended the most active perpetrators. From the very beginning of the sit-down protest the police requested the participants through loudspeakers to proceed to the stage, not to act on provocation and not to commit unlawful acts, but these requests had no effect and therefore [it was clear that] the breaking of the cordon had been organised. In suppressing it the police officers acted in coordination and concert. They did not use force or special means of restraint. However, the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve the use of force and special means of restraint, in so far as necessary, against persons putting up resistance.",
                "Later on, in the area of Malyy Kamennyy Bridge and at the [park] corner some localised confrontations took place ... force and special means of restraint were used. All those detained at Bolotnaya Square were taken to the police stations ... Administrative offence reports were then submitted to the Justices of the Peace for consideration on the merits.",

[they] provoked mass disorder, during which the participants threw various objects at the police, thus causing injuries to some of them. Because of this turn of events the police officers detained those participating in the mass disorder with justifiable use of force, and by special means of restraint against those who resisted.",

                "“The political organisers and the formal organisers, we all had a clear idea ... and the Moscow mayor ’ s office confirmed that the march would follow the same route as the one that had taken place on 4 February 2012. Bolotnaya Square is a traditional place for holding various opposition events. We all had a clear understanding what the route would be, where the stage would be, what the layout would be. We came there at that time for a rather traditional, customary event, the scenario of which was well-known to everybody ... two days beforehand the maps showing where people would assemble and the route of the march were published on the official [news] website RiaNovosti; they are still posted there. The map was published on the [police] website ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ and this map is still posted there. Not only the organisers, but the participants too, they knew where they were going ... When we approached the venue of the meeting ... we saw that the map showing where people would assemble on the square had been essentially altered. It was quite different from the map of 4 February [2012], and, above all, different from the document which had been agreed with the Moscow mayor ’ s office and had been published on the website[s] RiaNovosti and ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ ... [according to which] people were to assemble on Bolotnaya Embankment as well as in the park at Bolotnaya Square. However, when we came we saw that the park at Bolotnaya Square, taking up approximately 80% of the square, was barred and cordoned off ... since [the cordon] did not correspond [to the map] the column stopped. The event organisers and the people who came just waited for this question to be resolved, for the police to remove the wrong cordon, for the police chiefs to reply as to what had changed, why the approved meeting was not being conducted according to the scenario that had been approved ... I had previously [organised events] ... Somebody had taken the map and changed the location of the meeting. This had practically never happened before ... to show visually that we were not going anywhere, we sat on the ground ... the first line of [the police] cordon was composed of 20-year-old conscripts, and with a thousand people pressing on it the cordon broke. It could only break. This led to an uncontrollable situation, as several policemen were walking and trying to say something through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. Some activists passing by were also speaking through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. No authorities were present on the spot. And [it was] impossible to understand who was in command. So all of that caused the rupture of the police cordon. People started spreading across that spot ...Then I tried to walk over to the stage to try and explain to the gathering what was going on, using the amplifiers. I did not know then that the police had already cut off the amplifiers.",
                "[Question to the witness] Did anybody try to negotiate with the participants of the sit-down protest?",
                "Attempts were made, as far as was possible in the circumstances ... everybody had stopped because we all wanted to understand where the representatives from the mayor ’ s office were, where the appropriate representative of the Department of the Interior was. All the [high-ranking] police officers were asked, but they only shrugged. Nobody could understand what was going on. The State Duma deputies present on the spot tried to act as negotiators, but ... they said that nobody wanted to come up to us. We could see some police officers resembling chiefs, at a distance ... but it was impossible to get to them ... it was impossible to reach the [police] command. Nobody would come to us. Nobody could negotiate despite everyone ’ s wish to do so.",

I have set out the arguments [as to why] I considered that there had been ample evidence that the officials of the Moscow Department of the Interior had deliberately provoked the crowd to panic so that [they] could later make claims regarding mass disorder.”"

                "“The negotiations with the [mayor ’ s office] were very difficult this time ... I had been the organiser of most events from 25 December 2011. It was always possible to meet the deadline, to find a compromise, [but not this time]. ... It was [only] on 4 [May 2012] that we received the written agreement. On the same day the working meeting took place ... Usually, everything is decided no later than five days before the event. This time there was practically twenty-four hours ’ notice. We could not even bring the vehicles carrying the stage to the square before 1 p.m. [on 6 May 2012]. We were put under very harsh conditions ... we only had three hours to put up the stage ... At the [working meeting] technical issues were discussed, but for the previous events we held, as a matter of practice, [there was] an on-site reconnaissance: the representatives of the organisers [together with] the representatives of the police ... would visit the site, walk through the route and determine where the barriers would be put, the stage, the lavatories, so that there was no ambiguity in understanding how the event would unfold. This time, because [the working meeting] was on 4 [May 2012], and the event was on 6 [May 2012], it was already clear at the working meeting that we wouldn ’ t have time for an on-site reconnaissance; therefore at Mr Deynichenko ’ s suggestion it was stated that in organising the event we would follow the example of the assembly held on 4 February [2012]. Then, it was also a march from Kaluzhskaya Square and a meeting at Bolotnaya Square. The only thing that was noted was that this time the stage would be a bit closer to the park at Bolotnaya Square, at the corner of the square, because originally it had been declared that there would be 5,000 participants. We had a feeling that people were disappointed, somehow low-spirited, and that not many would come. When we realised that there would be more people I told Mr Oleynik [the First Deputy Director of the Regional Security Department], but he told us that it was unacceptable. But it was clear that we could not do anything about it. We warned that there would be significantly more participants ... When we called Mr Deynichenko the following day he told [us] that he had had a map drawn up by the Department of the Interior, and that Mr Udaltsov could come during the day to see it to clarify any issues. During the day he postponed the meeting several times and then he no longer answered the phone. Therefore it was not possible to see or discuss the map.",

                "No, of course not. The event of 4 February [2012] had been organised so that the meeting was held at Bolotnaya Square. Bolotnaya Square is an area comprising the park and Bolotnaya Embankment. It was supposed that people would ... turn [like before] towards the park. It was said that everything except the position of the stage, which would be 20 metres further forward, would be the same as [the last] time; this was expressly spelled out. We were guided by it.",

                "This was spelled out at the big working meeting at the office of Mr Oleynik and in his presence. Since we realised that we had no time for an on-the-spot reconnaissance, Mr Deynichenko suggested that we follow the same route as the last time as we were already familiar with it.",
                "... Nadezhda Mityushkina called me several times and complained that they were having trouble bringing in the equipment ... that they could not find anyone in charge. Usually it is the police representative who is responsible for the event, separately for the march and for the meeting. When I crossed [to] the area allocated to the march, even before passing through the metal detectors, Colonel Makhonin, who is traditionally in charge of the march, called me. We met. I gave him a written undertaking not to breach the law ... I told him that [two members of staff] had been arrested [at the stage area] ... he promised to release them ...",

                "... at the turning [from Malyy Kamennyy Bridge] the procession came to a standstill ... some people sat on the ground ... those who sat down had justifiably asked for more room. I could not push through to get there. I learned that both [State Duma deputies] were conducting negotiations; I thought that it was probably going to settle this situation ... at a certain point Ms Mityushkina called me and said that the police were demanding to terminate the event. I explained ... that if [the police] considered that there had been breaches, they had to give us time to remedy these defects, they could not end the event at once. I called Mr Udaltsov ... and said that we were coming, [that there was] no need to end anything. Actually, when I reached the corner the sit-in protest had already ended.

On the website of the Moscow Department of the Interior a map was posted showing the location of the police [cordon] and the access points. The map was in the public domain and one could see that the park of Bolotnaya Square should have been open. But it turned out to be closed. Moreover, we openly announced on the Internet, and it was reported in the media, that the route would be exactly the same as on 4 February 2012 ... On 4 February 2012 there was an authorised event ... all of [ Bolotnaya ] Square was open, no cordons on Bolshoy Kamennyy Bridge. We easily turned into the square, there had been no scuffles ... we were sure that on 6 May 2012 it would be exactly the same picture ... but the police had deceived us, blocked Bolotnaya Square, having left a very narrow passage for the demonstrators. We understood that it would be hard to pass through this bottleneck. We stopped, and to show the police that we were not going to storm the Kremlin and the [ Bolshoy ] Kamennyy Bridge we sat on the ground ... Mr Gudkov [the State Duma deputy], ... offered to be an intermediary in the negotiations between the protesters and the police ... we waited, all was peaceful ... he several times attempted to negotiate but this came to nothing. It became clear that ... the crowd were about to panic. We got up. And an awful scuffle began ... I was moving [to the stage] ... when I arrived there I saw a strange scene for an authorised event. The microphones had all been switched off, Mr Navalnyy and Mr Udaltsov had been arrested just before me. The police never act like that at authorised events. I took a megaphone and addressed the people. I did not speak for long. Within a few minutes the police apprehended me. ...",

He had reached an agreement with the officers of the Moscow Department of the Interior that the cordon would be moved back, but the organisers who had filed the notice [of the event] should have signed the necessary documents.

                "1. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly",
                "Only peaceful assemblies are protected",
                "An assembly should be deemed peaceful if its organisers have professed peaceful intentions and the conduct of the assembly is non-violent. The term ‘ peaceful ’ should be interpreted to include conduct that may annoy or give offence, and even conduct that temporarily hinders, impedes or obstructs the activities of third parties.",
                "5. Implementing Freedom of Peaceful Assembly Legislation",
                "5.1 Pre -event planning with law enforcement officials",
                "Wherever possible, and especially in the case of large assemblies or assemblies on controversial issues, it is recommended that the organiser discuss with the law enforcement officials the security and public safety measures that are put in place prior to the event. Such discussions might, for example, cover the deployment of law enforcement personnel, stewarding arrangements, and particular concerns relating to the policing operation.",
                "5.3 A human rights approach to policing assemblies",
                "The policing of assemblies must be guided by the human rights principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination and must adhere to applicable human rights standards. In particular, the State has a positive duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable peaceful assemblies to take place without participants fearing physical violence. Law enforcement officials must also protect participants of a peaceful assembly from any person or group (including agents provocateurs and counter-demonstrators) that attempts to disrupt or inhibit it in any way.",
                "5.4 The use of negotiation and/or mediation to de-escalate conflict",
                "If a standoff or other dispute arises during the course of an assembly, negotiation or mediated dialogue may be an appropriate means of trying to reach an acceptable resolution. Such dialogue – whilst not always successful – can serve as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict, the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions, or recourse to the use of force.",
                "15. ... For the purposes of the Guidelines, an assembly means the intentional and temporary presence of a number of individuals in a public place for a common expressive purpose.",
                "18. The question of at what point an assembly can no longer be regarded as a temporary presence (thus exceeding the degree of tolerance presumptively to be afforded by the authorities towards all peaceful assemblies) must be assessed in the individual circumstances of each case. ... Where an assembly causes little or no inconvenience to others then the authorities should adopt a commensurately less stringent test of temporariness ... the term ‘ temporary ’ should not preclude the erection of protest camps or other non-permanent constructions.",
                "‘ Peaceful ’ and ‘ non-peaceful ’ assemblies",
                "25. ’ Peaceful ’ assemblies: Only ‘ peaceful ’ assembly is protected by the right to freedom of assembly. ...",
                "26. The term ‘ peaceful ’ should be interpreted to include conduct that may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote, and even conduct that temporarily hinders, impedes or obstructs the activities of third parties. Thus, by way of example, assemblies involving purely passive resistance should be characterized as ‘ peaceful ’ ...",
                "28. If this fundamental criterion of ‘ peacefulness ’ is met, it triggers the positive obligations entailed by the right to freedom of peaceful assembly on the part of the State authorities ... It should be noted that assemblies that survive this initial test (thus, prima facie, deserving protection) may still legitimately be restricted on public order or other legitimate grounds ...",
                "38. To aid certainty, any prior restrictions should be formalised in writing and communicated to the organiser of the event within a reasonable timeframe (see further paragraph 135 below). Furthermore, the relevant authorities must ensure that any restrictions imposed during an event are in full conformity with the law and consistent with established jurisprudence. Finally, the imposition, after an assembly, of sanctions and penalties which are not prescribed by law is not permitted.",
                "95. Whether behaviour constitutes the intentional incitement of violence is inevitably a question which must be assessed on the particular circumstances. Some difficulty arises where the message concerns unlawful activity, or where it could be construed as inciting others to commit non-violent but unlawful action. Expressing support for unlawful activity can, in many cases, be distinguished from disorderly conduct, and should not therefore face restriction on public order grounds. The touchstone must again be the existence of an imminent threat of violence.",
                "96. ... resort to [hate] speech by participants in an assembly does not of itself necessarily justify the dispersal of the event, and law enforcement officials should take measures (such as arrest) only against the particular individuals involved (either during or after the event).",
                "Restrictions imposed during an assembly",
                "108. The role of the police or other law enforcement personnel during an assembly will often be to enforce any prior restrictions imposed in writing by the regulatory body. No additional restrictions should be imposed by law enforcement personnel unless absolutely necessary in light of demonstrably changed circumstances. On occasion, however, the situation on the ground may deteriorate (participants, for example, might begin using or inciting imminent violence), and the authorities may have to impose further measures to ensure that other relevant interests are adequately safeguarded. In the same way that reasons must be adduced to demonstrate the need for prior restrictions, any restrictions imposed in the course of an assembly must be equally rigorously justified. Mere suspicions will not suffice, and the reasons must be both relevant and sufficient. In such circumstances, it will be appropriate for other civil authorities (such as an Ombudsman ’ s office) to have an oversight role in relation to the policing operation, and law enforcement personnel should be accountable to an independent body. Furthermore ... unduly broad discretionary powers afforded to law enforcement officials may breach the principle of legality given the potential for arbitrariness. The detention of participants during an assembly (on grounds of their committing administrative, criminal or other offences) should meet a high threshold given the right to liberty and security of person and the fact that interferences with freedom of assembly are inevitably time sensitive. Detention should be used only in the most pressing situations when failure to detain would result in the commission of serious criminal offences.",
                "Decision-making and review process",
                "132. The regulatory authority ... should fairly and objectively assess all available information to determine whether the organisers and participants of a notified assembly are likely to conduct the event in a peaceful manner, and to ascertain the probable impact of the event on the rights and freedoms of other non-participant stakeholders. In doing so, it may be necessary to facilitate meetings with the event organiser and other interested parties.",
                "133. The regulatory authority should also ensure that any relevant concerns raised are communicated to the event organiser, and the organiser should be offered an opportunity to respond to any concerns raised. This is especially important if these concerns might later be cited as the basis for imposing restrictions on the event. Providing the organiser with such information allows them the opportunity to address the concerns, thus diminishing the potential for disorder and helping foster a cooperative, rather than confrontational, relationship between the organisers and the authorities.",
                "134. Assembly organisers, the designated regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials, and other parties whose rights might be affected by an assembly, should make every effort to reach mutual agreement on the time, place and manner of an assembly. If, however, agreement is not possible and no obvious resolution emerges, negotiation or mediated dialogue may help reach a mutually agreeable accommodation in advance of the notified date of the assembly. Genuine dialogue between relevant parties can often yield a more satisfactory outcome for everyone involved than formal recourse to the law. The facilitation of negotiations or mediated dialogue can usually best be performed by individuals or organisations not affiliated with either the State or the organiser. The presence of parties ’ legal representatives may also assist in facilitating discussions between the assembly organiser and law enforcement authorities. Such dialogue is usually most successful in establishing trust between parties if it is begun at the earliest possible opportunity. Whilst not always successful, it serves as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict or the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions.",
                "135. Any restrictions placed on an assembly should be communicated in writing to the event organiser with a brief explanation of the reason for each restriction (noting that such explanation must correspond with the permissible grounds enshrined in human rights law and as interpreted by the relevant courts). The burden of proof should be on the regulatory authority to show that the restrictions imposed are reasonable in the circumstances. Such decisions should also be communicated to the organiser within a reasonable timeframe – i.e. sufficiently far in advance of the date of a proposed event to allow the decision to be judicially appealed to an independent tribunal or court before the notified date of the event.",
                "136. The regulatory authority should publish its decisions so that the public has access to reliable information about events taking place in the public domain. This might be done, for example, by posting decisions on a dedicated web-site.",
                "147. Governments must ensure that law enforcement officials receive adequate training in the policing of public assemblies. Training should equip law enforcement agencies to act in a manner that avoids escalation of violence and minimises conflict, and should include ‘ soft skills ’ such as negotiation and mediation. ...",
                "149. Law enforcement agencies should be proactive in engaging with assembly organizers: [o] fficers should seek to send clear messages that inform crowd expectations and reduce the potential for conflict escalation ... Furthermore, there should be a nominated point of contact within the law enforcement agency whom protesters can contact before or during an assembly. These contact details should be widely advertised.",
                "150. The policing operation should be characterized by a policy of ‘ no surprises ’ : [l] aw enforcement officers should allow time for people in a crowd to respond as individuals to the situation they face, including any warnings or directions given to them.",
                "157. Using mediation or negotiation to de-escalate tensions during an assembly: [ i ]f a standoff or dispute arises during the course of an assembly, negotiation or mediated dialogue may be an appropriate means of trying to reach an acceptable resolution.",
                "159. Law enforcement officials should differentiate between peaceful and non ‑ peaceful participants: [ n]either isolated incidents of sporadic violence, nor the violent acts of some participants in the course of a demonstration, are themselves sufficient grounds to impose sweeping restrictions on peaceful participants in an assembly. Law enforcement officials should not therefore treat a crowd as homogenous if detaining participants or (as a last resort) forcefully dispersing an assembly.",
                "164. Policing peaceful assemblies that turn into non-peaceful assemblies: [a] ssemblies can change from being peaceful to non-peaceful and thus forfeit the protection afforded under human rights law ... Such an assembly may thus be terminated in a proportionate manner. However, the use of violence by a small number of participants in an assembly (including the use of inciting language) does not automatically turn an otherwise peaceful assembly into a non-peaceful assembly, and any intervention should aim to deal with the particular individuals involved rather than dispersing the entire event.",
                "165. Dispersal of assemblies: [s]o long as assemblies remain peaceful, they should not be dispersed by law enforcement officials. Indeed, dispersal of assemblies should be a measure of last resort and should be governed by prospective rules informed by international standards. These rules need not be elaborated in legislation, but should be expressed in domestic law enforcement guidelines, and legislation should require that such guidelines be developed. Guidelines should specify the circumstances that warrant dispersal, and who is entitled to make dispersal orders (for example, only police officers of a specified rank and above).",
                "166. Dispersal should not occur unless law enforcement officials have taken all reasonable measures to facilitate and protect the assembly from harm (including, for example, quieting hostile onlookers who threaten violence), and unless there is an imminent threat of violence.",
                "167. Dispersal should not therefore result where a small number of participants in an assembly act in a violent manner. In such instances, action should be taken against those particular individuals. Similarly, if ‘ agents provocateurs ’ infiltrate an otherwise peaceful assembly, the authorities should take appropriate action to remove the ‘ agents provocateurs ’ rather than terminating or dispersing the assembly, or declaring it to be unlawful ...",
                "168. If dispersal is deemed necessary, the assembly organiser and participants should be clearly and audibly informed prior to any intervention by law enforcement personnel. Participants should also be given reasonable time to disperse voluntarily. Only if participants then fail to disperse may law enforcement officials intervene further.",

The Government contended that the authorities had acted lawfully and reasonably in the preparation of the public assembly of 6 May 2012, both during the event and in assessing the need and the means to disperse it at the point when it ceased to be peaceful. They pointed out that the Moscow authorities and the event organisers had worked out the terms of the public assembly in their written exchange and in person at the working meeting on 4 May 2012. However, the police had suspected the protesters of intending to act in breach of the agreed terms, and on 5 May 2012 the prosecutor ’ s office had issued the organisers with a warning to that effect. At the same time, the police had developed a detailed security plan providing for the necessary security measures (see paragraphs 16 et seq. above)."

They had disregarded the police instructions to proceed to the designated venue at Bolotnaya Embankment, even though the venue had been accessible, and had sat on the ground, causing scuffles and disorder. According to the Government, two State Duma deputies, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation and a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation had supported the police ’ s demands and tried to convince the protesters to follow the route, to no avail. Then, at 6 p.m. one of the organisers, acting at the request of the police, had announced the early termination of the meeting; from 5.58 p.m. to 7 p.m. some of the protesters had attempted to break the police cordon and had thrown various objects at the police. From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. the police had gradually forced the protesters to leave and had arrested those who put up the most active resistance. The Government submitted that the intervention of the police had been justified since the assembly had ceased to be “peaceful” within the meaning of Article 11 of the Convention. In dispersing the protesters, the police had not resorted to excessive force: only police truncheons had been used; only the most aggressive perpetrators had been targeted; and no tear gas or smoke bombs had been deployed."

In addition, the Government referred to two decisions refusing to open a criminal investigation into alleged police brutality (see paragraphs 52 and 61 above).

Secondly, he argued that the authorities had unilaterally altered the original meeting layout without informing the organisers or the public. He contended that the restriction of the area had had no purpose other than to prevent the possibility of tents being erected in the park. Rather than serving to prevent public disorder, that restriction had created a bottleneck at the entrance to the meeting venue and had caused tension resulting in a spontaneous sit-in by a small number of participants, including the organisers.

He pointed out that under domestic law, the police were required to suspend the assembly first and to give the organisers time to remedy any breach before they could terminate it. In any event, he denied that the assembly had ceased to be peaceful, despite numerous incidents of confrontation with the police. No confrontations had taken place within the authorised perimeter in front of the stage. Overall, he argued that the response by the police had been uncoordinated and disproportionate and that it had had the effect of escalating the confrontation rather than defusing it. The immense number of police officers and extensive crowd-control resources deployed at the site of the assembly should have allowed the authorities to ensure the peaceful continuation of the meeting, but they had chosen to terminate it instead.

He maintained that he had been arrested merely for his presence at the site of the rally as a means of discouraging him and others from participating in opposition rallies. He further complained that the domestic courts had taken no account of his arguments and exonerating evidence and had imposed the most severe penalty possible.

The right to freedom of assembly, one of the foundations of a democratic society, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. In examining whether restrictions to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Court has, however, consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation (see Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, § 42, 5 March 2009). It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001-X, and Galstyan v.

When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they took. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine, after establishing that it pursued a “legitimate aim”, whether it answered a “pressing social need” and in particular whether it was proportionate to that aim and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient” (see Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24876/94, § 104, 18 January 2001; Ashughyan v.

The limits of tolerance expected towards an unlawful assembly depend on the specific circumstances, including the duration and the extent of public disturbance caused by it, and whether its participants had been given sufficient opportunity to manifest their views (see Cisse v.

The Government contended that on that day the assembly leaders had intended to take the march outside the designated area, to set up a protest campsite and, possibly, to hold an unauthorised assembly near the Kremlin. When they were barred by the police cordon, the organisers called for a sit-in and encouraged assaults on the police cordon.

They denied that it had been their original intention to go outside the designated meeting area; conversely, the sit-in was a reaction to the authorities ’ unilateral change of the meeting layout. The protesters sat on the ground in an attempt to negotiate a passage through the park at Bolotnaya Square, which they considered to be a part of the agreed meeting venue, but the authorities showed no willingness to negotiate or even to communicate with them. From this point of view, the ensuing breaking of the cordon and confrontations were a consequence of the authorities ’ uncooperative conduct.

The authorities had closely monitored the activities of the opposition leaders in the period preceding 6 May 2012 by accessing open sources and by means of secret surveillance. They had suspected the opposition activists of plotting a popular uprising, starting with unlawful public assemblies and setting up campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement and similar to the “ Maidan ” protest in Ukraine (see the testimonies of Mr Deynichenko, Mr Zdorenko, Mr Makhonin and Ms Volondina, paragraph 63 above).

Before deciding on the role of undeclared goals, whether on the part of the organisers or the authorities, the Court will comment on the formal reasons for the decisions taken when the assembly was being organised. On the face of it, the decision to close the park to the rally does not appear in itself hostile or underhand vis-à-vis the organisers, given that the embankment was large enough to accommodate the assembly, even with a significant margin for exceeding the expected number of participants. According to the statement of the Moscow Regional Department of Security (see paragraph 63 above), the maximum capacity of the Bolotnaya Embankment was around 26,000 people. It was therefore large enough not only for the originally declared 5,000 participants, or the officially recorded turnout of 8,000, but even for the organisers ’ retrospective estimate of 25,000. However, the organisers objected not only to the lack of access to the park, but, above all, to the discovery of a last-minute alteration of the venue layout, which allegedly led to a misunderstanding and the disruption of the assembly."

When cross-examined, Mr Deynichenko and Mr Sharapov stated that the inclusion of the park had not been requested or discussed. Assuming that the latter was true and no express agreement had been reached as regards the park, the Court nevertheless considers that it was not entirely unreasonable on the part of the organisers to perceive it as having been included by default. Firstly, the official boundary of Bolotnaya Square comprised the park, as confirmed by the expert witnesses N. and M., as well as the head of Yakimanka district municipality of Moscow.

In any event, both the security plan and the maps used by the police forces remained police internal documents and were not shared with the organisers (see the Moscow Department of the Interior ’ s reply to the Investigative Committee, paragraph 48 above, and the Moscow City Court judgment in Mr Udaltsov ’ s and Mr Razvozzhayev ’ s case, paragraph 63 above)."

The independent observers from the Ombudsman ’ s office who had been involved in the negotiations explained that the protesters, faced with the narrowed-down passage, had demanded that it be widened. Moreover, they named the police official, Colonel Biryukov, to whom the Ombudsman had passed on that demand (see the testimonies of Ms Mirza and Mr Vasilyev, paragraphs 57 and 59 above).

Nevertheless, the same sources made it clear that with only twenty to fifty people sitting on the ground, the sit-in remained localised and left sufficient space for those wishing to pass. It is beyond doubt that the sit-in was strictly peaceful.

Mr Makhonin, for his part, testified that he had not tried to call Mr Udaltsov until he arrived at Bolotnaya Square “after the mass disorder had already begun” (see paragraph 63 above).

It is also unclear exactly what prompted that decision, although some witnesses suggested that it was because of the sit-in. The fact that at 5.55 p.m. the authorities were threatening the assembly leaders with criminal sanctions corroborates that hypothesis (see paragraph 34 above). It is clear, in any event, that at 6 p.m. when the announcement was made, the crowd had built up, and there had been squeezing and pushing and isolated incidents of small-scale aggression at the cordon at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, but no widespread disorder or intensive fighting."

According to the authorities, at that stage it was justified to announce an emergency termination under section 17.3, which curtails the termination procedure in the event of mass disorder. The Court considers that, irrespective of whether the domestic requirements for “mass disorder” had been met, the tensions were still localised at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge while the rest of the venue remained calm. The authorities have not shown that, prior to declaring the whole meeting over, they had attempted to separate the turbulent sector and target the problems there, so as to enable the meeting to continue in the sector of the stage where the situation remained peaceful. The Court is therefore not convinced that the termination of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square was inevitable."

However, even assuming that the decision to terminate the assembly was taken because of a real and imminent risk that violence would spread and intensify, and that the authorities acted within the margin of appreciation which is to be allowed in such circumstances, that decision could have been implemented in different ways and using various methods. Given the diversity in the circumstances of the individual protesters, in particular the degree of their involvement or non ‑ involvement in clashes and the wide range of consequences faced by them, it is impossible to give a general assessment of the police conduct in dispersing the assembly at Bolotnaya Square. For this reason, the Court will abstain from analysing the manner in which the police dispersed the protesters at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, as it falls outside the scope of the applicant ’ s case. The Court will examine the actions taken against the applicant personally, and in doing so it will take into account the general situation in his immediate vicinity, that is, the area in front of the stage inside the designated meeting area at Bolotnaya Embankment."

For the purposes of its analysis under Article 11, it is sufficient to note that, even if the applicant was on the wrong side of the time-limit, measures taken after an assembly has ended fall, as a general rule, within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention as long as there is a link between the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly by the applicant and the measures taken against him (see Ezelin, cited above, § 41, and Navalnyy and Yashin, cited above, § 52). Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, even after the assembly was officially terminated, the guarantees of Article 11 continued to apply in respect of the applicant, notwithstanding the clashes at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge.

At the same time, the Court observes, and the Government have insisted on this point, that the applicant was not arrested and punished for breaching the rules on public assemblies. Even if his presence at the meeting venue after its termination were to be considered a manifestation of his objection to the early termination of the assembly, that was not the offence with which he was charged. According to the domestic courts and the Government ’ s submissions, he was arrested, detained and sentenced to fifteen days ’ imprisonment because he was obstructing traffic and disobeyed lawful police orders to stop doing so."

His motives for walking on the road and obstructing the traffic are left unexplained by the domestic judgments; the applicant ’ s explanation that there was no traffic and that he was simply not quick enough to leave the venue in the general confusion has not been contested or ruled out. Therefore, even assuming that the applicant ’ s arrest, pre-trial detention and administrative sentence complied with domestic law and pursued one of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention – presumably, public safety – the measures taken against him were grossly disproportionate to the aim pursued. There was no “pressing social need” to arrest the applicant and to escort him to the police station. There was especially no need to sentence him to a prison term, albeit a short one."

Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim ’ s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘ special features ’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44.

He contested the allegation that he could have left Kyiv for Moscow of his own will and pointed out that his “disappearance” had occurred during an interval in the consultation with the HIAS; he had left some of his personal belongings at the NGO ’ s office and some in a locker at the Kyiv railway station. Those belongings had been handed in to the police and had then been given to the applicant ’ s counsel. He alleged that his abductors had deviated from the shortest route to Moscow by at least 330 km, according to the Ukrainian border-control stamp in his passport; at the same time, there was no stamp by the Russian border control in his passport. The first applicant also pointed out that at the time of his entry into Russia he had been on the “wanted” list and would have been detained if he had tried to enter in a regular way. He contended that neither the Ukrainian nor the Russian authorities had properly investigated his abduction despite the ample evidence, including witness statements. Moreover, the Ukrainian authorities had acknowledged that the investigation had been deficient when in 2014 they had quashed the decision of 7 December 2012 and ordered its resumption.

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.

By presenting witness statements from the HIAS staff the applicant made a prima facie case of abduction, possibly associated with inhuman or degrading treatment during his transfer to Russia, which placed the Russian authorities under an obligation to investigate it. If they could not take any practical steps towards an inquiry for lack of territorial jurisdiction, it was their obligation to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian authorities (see Güzelyurtlu and Others, cited above, §§ 232- 33), but this has not been done. In any event, the order for the first applicant ’ s abduction was allegedly given in Russia, and it was incumbent on the Russian authorities to verify these allegations.

The Government did not comment on the applicant ’ s submissions about his early pick-up and late drop-off times.

The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254 - 255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant ’ s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 80 and 81, 26 July 2001, and Artemov v. Russia, no. 14945/03, § 77, 3 April 2014)."

It observes that throughout the whole period of the first applicant ’ s detention the domestic courts accepted that there was a risk of him absconding because of police information about his previous attempt to flee the investigation, as well as his absence from his registered address and his lack of employment. The references to his frequent travels, his possession of a travel passport and his connections in Russia and abroad did not feature in the later detention orders. The Court will therefore examine whether the three above-mentioned factors remained relevant and sufficient in the later stages of the criminal proceedings."

However, according to the official version, it was the first applicant who presented himself on 21 October 2012 to surrender and confess. Moreover, at the time of his journey to Ukraine in October 2012 he did not have the status of a suspect in a criminal case and was not subject to any preventive measure; his absence from his registered address at the time when the authorities decided to bring charges was not in breach of any rule or undertaking. It appears that the courts did not perform a thorough assessment of the information provided by the police and did not question their contradictory allegations as regards the first applicant ’ s previous attempts to flee. As to the applicant ’ s lack of fixed employment and the fact that he was not registered at his de facto address in Moscow, the Court considers that the domestic courts did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why these circumstances constituted an obstacle to applying other preventive measures, in particular house arrest."

Likewise, the courts ’ reasoning did not contain sufficient details to enable the Court to uphold their finding that in the later stages of the investigation and during the trial the applicant still posed risks of reoffending, tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses.

It is not clear, however, why the applicant had to remain in detention for that purpose. Certainly, if released, he could have accessed the file under the same arrangements as persons to whom pre-trial detention had never been applied. Moreover, the Court has previously found that the provisions of Russian law concerning the extension of detention pending the study of the case file by a defendant were not foreseeable in their application, in violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Tsarenko v. Russia, no. 5235/09, §§ 59 ‑ 63, 3 March 2011, and Pyatkov v. Russia, no. 61767/08, §§ 86-91, 13 November 2012)."

In particular, he had repeatedly travelled to other regions and abroad and had often been absent from his address and unreachable by telephone. Moreover, he had been charged with and convicted of an administrative offence for having taken part in an unauthorised stationary demonstration on 27 October 2012; then, on 15 December 2012 he had been arrested at an opposition rally; and on 13 January 2013 he had attempted to set some merchandise on fire during a public event while calling for protest actions. Therefore, the court had considered it necessary to apply a stricter preventive measure and had placed the applicant under house arrest. Bail, as an alternative measure, had been duly rejected.

In particular, house arrest is considered, in view of its degree and intensity, to amount to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. The Court has held that this type of deprivation of liberty requires relevant and sufficient reasons, just as with pre-trial detention. It has specified that the notions of “degree” and “intensity” in its case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, refer only to the degree of restrictions on liberty of movement, not to differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court would apply the same criteria for deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained ( ibid., §§ 104 and 113-14)."

                "214. The Court observes that the second applicant ’ s detention under house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking not to leave Moscow and to behave properly, in particular with reference to his participation in public events, seeing that, on at least one occasion, he had been given an administrative sanction for a breach of the procedure for holding public events. Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant ’ s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5 § 1 in this respect. Whether there were grounds which were “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify the house arrest is a question to be examined under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Buzadji, cited above, § 61)."

As noted above, the second applicant ’ s house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking to remain in Moscow and to display proper behaviour. Although the risks of his influencing witnesses, continuing criminal activity, destroying evidence and obstructing the course of the criminal proceedings were also listed among the grounds, the court did not indicate any specific facts showing the emergence of those risks. The gravity of the charges, the second applicant ’ s possession of a travel passport, his wife ’ s and children ’ s temporary residence in Ukraine and his connections were referred to in a general manner, and these circumstances had already existed at the time when the original preventive measure of an undertaking rather than detention was ordered.

In finding the second applicant in breach of the undertaking the domestic court first noted his frequent absences from his home address and his trips to other regions and abroad, and concluded that there was a risk of his absconding. This finding was based solely on one report stating that a police officer had been unable to reach the applicant in order to summon him to receive the indictment on 26 October 2012. However, it appears from the parties ’ submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow ’ s city limits in breach of the undertaking. Accordingly, the risk of his absconding was not sufficiently demonstrated in the judicial decision imposing house arrest."

Secondly, in relation to the alleged breach of the undertaking to display proper behaviour, the court relied on information about the second applicant ’ s participation in at least three opposition rallies, one of which resulted in an administrative conviction for holding a public event not compliant with the procedure established by law; on that basis it established the existence of a risk of his reoffending. As found above, the second applicant ’ s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant ’ s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as “relevant” and “sufficient”. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court ’ s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant ’ s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk. Moreover, the courts systematically rejected the applicant ’ s offer of bail without stating reasons beyond a formulaic indication that this would not suffice as a preventive measure."

The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses.

The clinic had replied on 1 April 2014 that no medical leave had been given to the second applicant. On the same day the court had ordered the applicant to attend the hearing and he had been brought to the court; his ability to stand trial had been assessed by a doctor called to the courtroom, and the second applicant had stated that he did not require medical assistance. The court had therefore resumed the hearing with the applicant present. However, the applicant had been removed from the courtroom for three days (1-3 April 2014) as a penalty for contempt of court following his loud remarks denigrating the trial court. On the three days of the trial when the second applicant had been absent, he had been represented by his lawyers. Therefore, there had been no violation of Article 6 on this account."

The Court observes that the criminal proceedings initially conducted against three co-defendants, namely both applicants and L., were divided into two separate criminal cases, one of which – against L. –resulted in the latter ’ s conviction in accelerated proceedings based on plea bargaining. Subsequently, L. testified at the applicants ’ trial as a witness, which the applicants considered to have undermined the overall fairness of the hearing in their criminal case. The Court has previously examined complaints about the absence of safeguards associated with similar procedures and summarised the relevant principles applicable to the establishment of facts and the use of co-defendants ’ statements as witness testimony in disjoined sets of proceedings (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, §§ 96-101 and 105-05, 23 February 2016), holding as follows:",

The Court accepts that in complex criminal proceedings involving several persons who cannot be tried together, references by the trial court to the participation of third parties, who may later be tried separately, may be indispensable for the assessment of the guilt of those on trial. Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 ).",
                "104. The Court has previously highlighted the first and most obvious guarantee to be secured when co-accused are tried in separate sets of proceedings, notably the courts ’ obligation to refrain from any statements that may have a prejudicial effect on the pending proceedings, even if they are not binding (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 42-43 and 64-56 ) ...",
                "105. The second requirement for the conduct of concurrent proceedings is that the quality of res judicata would not be attached to facts admitted in a case to which the individuals were not party. The state of the evidence admitted in one case must remain purely relative and its effect strictly limited to that particular set of proceedings. ...”"

The Court observes that, contrary to the above requirements, in the present case the decision to disjoin the case against L. did not involve an assessment of the countervailing interests or consultation of the applicants with a view to giving them an opportunity to object to the cases being separated. It finds that L. ’ s conviction following the use of plea bargaining and accelerated proceedings compromised his credibility as a witness in the applicants ’ case because he was compelled to maintain the statements he had made in order to negotiate the reduction of his sentence while not being bound by the witness oath."

Moreover, it must be noted that Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as worded at the material time, expressly conferred res judicata on judgments even if issued in accelerated proceedings. The Court recalls its previous finding that even if the courts were obliged to base their assessment exclusively on the material and testimony presented at the hearing, this provision required the court to remain concordant with the previous judgment (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov, cited above, § 236) which holds true in this case. The Court considers that both L. and the domestic courts had an obvious incentive to remain concordant with the findings made in the accelerated proceedings even though those findings had not been scrutinised in an adversarial manner."

This particular courtroom arrangement has already been examined by the Court from the standpoint of Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 127 and 148- 53 respectively). It found that although the conditions in hearing room no. 635 of Moscow City Court did not attain the minimum level of severity to constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, they amounted to a disproportionate restriction of the defendants ’ rights to participate effectively in the proceedings and to receive practical and effective legal assistance. In particular, the defendants were separated from the rest of the hearing room by glass, a physical barrier which to some extent reduced their direct involvement in the hearing and made it impossible for them to have confidential exchanges with legal counsel. However, the trial court did not seem to recognise the impact of these courtroom arrangements on their defence rights, and did not take any measures to compensate for these limitations."

Only on one occasion, on 20 March 2014, had the court adjourned the hearing on the basis that the first applicant needed rest after having been transferred to another detention facility.

It observes that the first applicant and his lawyers made numerous detailed and specific complaints alleging that he could not concentrate on the hearing because of exhaustion and sleep deprivation. The courts, however, considered that the schedule was reasonable on the basis of the time the applicant spent in court. They did not take into consideration the time the first applicant spent being transferred, although they accepted the report from the detention facility indicating the drop-off time as 10.15 p.m., implying that this left him seven hours and forty-five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 103-11). The cumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant ’ s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers. While the Court accepts the domestic court ’ s reasons for expediting the proceedings, it considers that in this case insufficient consideration was given to the first applicant ’ s requests for a less intensive hearing schedule."

The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above).

Accordingly, in the circumstances of the case, Article 10 of the Convention is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11 of the Convention, which is the lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202; Akarsubaşı and Alçiçek v. Turkey, no. 19620/12, §§ 31 ‑ 33, 23 January 2018; and Öğrü v. Turkey, no. 19631/12, § 13, 17 October 2017). As such, the applicants ’ complaints should be examined under Article 11 of the Convention. On the other hand, notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 of the Convention must, in the present case, also be considered in the light of Article 10 of the Convention. The protection of personal opinions, secured by Article 10 of the Convention, is one of the objectives of freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention (see Ezelin, cited above, § 37)."

They claimed that the authorities ’ last ‑ minute change of the meeting layout had caused the stand-off between the protesters and the police and some isolated clashes, but not riots. The Court has previously examined the events at issue in relation to complaints about disruptive security measures implemented at the site of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square (see Frumkin v. Russia, no. 74568/12, §§ 7-41 and 102 ‑ 30, 5 January 2016, and Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 169-71). It found, in particular, that the sit-in had begun because of the unexpected change of the venue layout, of which the police had not informed the organisers. It also found that the authorities had made an insufficient effort to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the tension caused by the confusion about the venue layout, and that breaking through the police cordon was not confirmed to have been the organisers ’ desired outcome (see Frumkin, cited above, §§ 113-16 and 128)."

The Court also observes, turning to the specific facts of this case, that the judgment of 24 July 2014 referred to surveillance material obtained undercover, in particular audio recordings of conversations, the content of which was partly contested by the applicants. The same judgment also relied on the content of the film Anatomy of Protest, Part Two, which was based on footage of which the provenance and reliability were contested by the applicants during the trial. In the proceedings before the Court the parties did not make detailed submissions as regards these pieces of evidence. Noting that the domestic courts examined them in adversarial proceedings in which the applicants were able to scrutinise and challenge the impugned evidence, the Court is not required to substitute its own assessment of the content and the probative value of these recordings for that of the domestic courts, or to call into question the facts established on the basis of them (see, inter alia, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 29, Series A no. 269, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015).

Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 77, ECHR 2001-IX). The guarantees of Article 11 of the Convention therefore apply to all gatherings except those where the organisers and participants have such intentions, incite violence or otherwise reject the foundations of a democratic society (see Sergey Kuznetsov v.

No witnesses at the trial stated that he had taken part in any violent acts or encouraged them; on the contrary, he insisted on a “strictly peaceful” form of conduct. It is noteworthy that the first applicant was not acting on the second applicant ’ s instructions when deciding to break through the police cordon (see witness testimony by State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomarev, paragraph 129 above).

Accordingly, these measures constituted an interference with the exercise of the freedom of assembly (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, § 172). The Court will therefore examine whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society”, as required by Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

As in previous cases, the Court considers that the applicability of this provision was not entirely inconceivable and that it has no grounds to disagree with the domestic courts ’ assessment of the situation made within the margin of their judicial discretion (ibid., §§ 173-75). It therefore finds that the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “prescribed by law”.

It also considers it sufficiently established that the tension escalated into clashes because of the law-enforcement officials ’ failure to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the dispute about the placement of the police cordon ( ibid., §§ 112-15 and 126). However, the judgment in respect of the second applicant attributed responsibility for the violence to the protesters, and to him personally as one of the organisers, without assessing to what extent the authorities had contributed to the deterioration of the assembly ’ s peaceful character."

He demanded airtime on Russia ’ s main television channels, called for the presidential inauguration of Mr Putin to be cancelled and for new elections to be held and called on the assembly participants to stay at the meeting venue for an indefinite protest action. He may also have encouraged the setting-up of campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement. These calls, in particular for overstaying the allocated time-slot of the assembly and for setting up a campsite, were clearly illegal as they would have been in breach of the established rules on holding a public assembly."

The fact that certain protesters may have committed violent acts does not affect the assessment of the second applicant ’ s conduct in the absence of evidence that they had been incited by him. The mere fact that the second applicant was one of the event organisers is not sufficient to hold him responsible for the conduct of the attendees (see Mesut Yıldız and Others v. Turkey, no. 8157/10, § 34, 18 July 2017 )."

Neither could the second applicant ’ s violent intentions be inferred from the circumstances underlying the related set of charges examined in the same set of proceedings, namely preparation of the organisation of acts of mass disorder (other than the one at Bolotnaya Square). In particular, no such intentions were apparent from the fundraising activities which he carried out before and after 6 May 2012 in order to finance opposition rallies, training sessions for activists and media campaigns. The recordings of negotiations examined at the trial and referred to in the judgment contained no reference to armed or other forceful methods of exerting political pressure on the authorities. In particular, the proposal to block railway lines made in the conversations recorded undercover and relied on by the domestic judgment was attributed to the first applicant, and in any event the extent of violence involved in that proposal was not assessed. The domestic judgments thus left open the question whether the “political instability” allegedly promoted by the second applicant carried an element of violence in the sense of riots or mass disorder, as opposed to advocating political change by peaceful means. The domestic courts therefore omitted a crucial element of the balancing exercise which is required by the proportionality principle when imposing sanctions for unlawful conduct at assemblies (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 142-44, and Gülcü v.

Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification (see Rai and Evans v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 26258/07 and 26255/07, 17 November 2009). A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty (see Akgöl and Göl v. Turkey, nos. 28495/06 and 28516/06, § 43, 17 May 2011, and Gün and Others, cited above, § 83 ).

It is also noteworthy that on one of the occasions when they did not interfere with the applicants'freedom of assembly, the authorities appeared somewhat reluctant to protect the members and followers of Ilinden from a group of counter ‑ demonstrators. As a result, some of the participants in Ilinden's rally were subjected to physical violence from their opponents (see paragraph 62 above). In this connection, the Court recalls that genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; it is the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben” v. Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, §§ 32 ‑ 34 ). It is also recalled that in a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly, as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 in fine ). The authorities were therefore bound to take adequate measures to prevent violent acts directed against the participants in Ilinden's rally, or at least limit their extent. However, it seems that they, while embarking on certain steps to enable the organisation's commemorative event to proceed peacefully, did not take all the appropriate measures which could have reasonably be expected from them under the circumstances, and thus failed to discharge their positive obligations under Article 11."

It found that Ilinden had not been registered and apparently had links with a political party, “ UMO Ilinden – PIRIN ”, which had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on 29 February 2000 for acting against the territorial integrity of the country (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 59489/00, §§ 21 ‑ 27, 20 October 2005 ). The holding of a meeting by Ilinden could therefore pose a threat to the territorial integrity of the country.

The Court observes that the provision authorising such measures, former Article 185 § 1 of the CCP, was formulated extremely vaguely and did not circumscribe the situations where the prosecution authorities could act (see paragraph 77 above).

As a result, some of the participants in Ilinden's rally were subjected to physical violence from their opponents (see paragraph 62 above). In this connection, the Court recalls that genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; it is the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben” v. Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, §§ 32 ‑ 34 ). It is also recalled that in a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly, as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 in fine ). The authorities were therefore bound to take adequate measures to prevent violent acts directed against the participants in Ilinden's rally, or at least limit their extent. However, it seems that they, while embarking on certain steps to enable the organisation's commemorative event to proceed peacefully, did not take all the appropriate measures which could have reasonably be expected from them under the circumstances, and thus failed to discharge their positive obligations under Article 11."

The court concluded that B.M. had organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order, namely by rioting. B.M. had been one of the leaders of the farmers ’ meeting on 16 May 2003, at which the farmers had decided to attempt to achieve their goals by organising protests next to major highways. The District Court noted that B.M. had coordinated the actions of the farmers and as a consequence, on 21 May 2003, approximately 500 people had gone on to the Vilnius- Klaipėda highway and had blocked it. As a result, traffic had been blocked until 23 May 2003. The ensuing serious breach of public order had been deliberate and had to be characterised as a riot. The District Court dismissed B.M. ’ s claim that he and other farmers had acted out of necessity because the roadblock had been their last opportunity to draw the government ’ s attention to their problems. The farmers had had an alternative, namely, they could have brought complaints before the administrative courts. The farmers had themselves mentioned that alternative during the meeting of 16 May 2003 (see paragraph 14 above). The District Court further noted that a person who created a dangerous situation by his or her actions could only rely on the defence of necessity when a dangerous situation arose through negligence (Article 31 § 2 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 65 below ).

The Regional Court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, public safety and public health, human dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers ’ actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order."

The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness. The Regional Court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative - law offence such as a traffic violation. As to the applicants ’ argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer, A.D., had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation (see paragraph 49 above), the Regional Court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence."

In describing the scope of the offence, the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features: the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence, damaging property or otherwise breaching public order, or the commission of those actions during a gathering. For the Supreme Court, a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order, caused public violence, or damaged property. The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent ( kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia ).

France ( C ‑ 265/95, judgment of 9 December 1997 – “the Commission case” ), concerning serious incidents which occurred in the south of France. Agricultural products from Spain and Italy had been destroyed by French farmers and acts of violence and vandalism had been committed in the relevant wholesale and retail sectors. The ECJ emphasised that, in accordance with the EC Treaty, the European internal market was characterised by the abolition, between member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods. Article 30 of the Treaty prohibited, between member States, quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. Therefore, all barriers, whether direct or indirect, actual or potential, to flows of imports in intra-Community trade had to be eliminated. Article 30, read in conjunction with Article 5 of the Treaty, also applied where a member State abstained from adopting the measures required in order to deal with obstacles to the free movement of goods which were not caused by the State."

It was, however, clear that the acts of violence committed in France against agricultural products originating in other member States created obstacles to intra-Community trade in those products. The incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years; in certain cases the French authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers, the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism, committed by persons whose faces were often not covered, had been filmed by television cameras. In spite of this, only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. This was sufficient for the ECJ to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the French government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-Community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30, taken in conjunction with Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of French farmers could not justify a failure to apply Community Law correctly, as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the State could not cope. It was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might, in appropriate cases, justify non-intervention by the police; however, this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident, and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue.",

The case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the Austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the Brenner motorway, the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours. In conjunction with a pre-existing, national, generally applicable ban on holiday driving, this caused the Brenner motorway (an essential intra-Community transit route) to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days, with a short interruption of a few hours."

It went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified. It observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member State under the EC Treaty, only the objective pursued by the national authorities, namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, being relevant. Both the free movement of goods, one of the fundamental principles of the EC Treaty, and the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest.

Under these circumstances, Austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly, and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions. In this respect, the ECJ stated as follows.",

The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining the demonstration cannot as such take away that right ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 155 ).

In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v.

For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities. A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well. So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants, and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally ( see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 84, with further references )."

Indeed, the gatherings, even when the demonstrators resorted to roadblocks, were not dispersed by the police. However, the applicants were subsequently convicted because of their role in the organisation and implementation of the roadblocks during the latter part of the demonstrations. As already indicated above, their conduct in this respect, albeit reprehensible, was not deemed to have been violent in character.

Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code provides that imprisonment for up to five years will be the sanction imposed on “a person who organises or provokes a gathering of people to commit public acts of violence, damage property or otherwise seriously breach public order, or a person who, during a riot, commits acts of violence, damages property or otherwise seriously breaches public order”. The domestic authorities did not accuse the applicants of committing acts of violence or of damaging property. They maintained, however, that the applicants had “ otherwise seriously breach [ ed ] public order”. In particular, on the basis of video - recordings, documentary evidence and witness statements, the District Court found that A.K. and B. M. had deliberately organised protests and coordinated the actions of the farmers in order to block the roads (see paragraphs 43 - 44 above) and that the other applicants, V.M., K.M. and A.P., had driven tractors onto the highway and parked them there and refused to obey lawful orders by the police to stop doing so (see paragraph 46 above). These findings were confirmed by the Kaunas Regional Court, which specified that A.K. and B.M. had been warned about their liability as organisers and had understood the unlawfulness of their actions (see paragraph 51 above). Finally, the Supreme Court provided an explanation of the substance of the offence punished under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code, indicating, inter alia, that a riot was a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order and that blocking the roads, stopping the traffic and disturbing the work of the State border - control authority was a means of causing such a breach (see paragraphs 56 - 57 above)."

However, as ordinary life can be disrupted in a potentially endless number of ways, it would be unrealistic to expect the national legislator to enumerate an exhaustive list of illegitimate means for achieving a particular aim. The Court therefore considers that the terms in which Article 283 § 1 is formulated satisfy the qualitative requirements emanating from its case-law."

The government ’ s inaction and its unilateral decision to stop the negotiations with the farmers had significantly impoverished rural areas.

In such circumstances, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should have prevailed over any resulting minimal disturbances to the free movement of goods. In this connection, the applicants alleged that Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 (see paragraph 77 above) recognised roadblocks as a form of strike action."

Knowing that roadblocks were likely to occur, the police had prepared action plans and alternative itineraries in the vicinity of the demonstrations, thus reducing any possible disruption to the flow of goods. The farmers themselves had foreseen measures, which were fully implemented, to ensure that traffic was redirected onto secondary roads. According to the applicants, on the critical days the flow of traffic had been “even better than usual”. This was proven by the “data from posts where the roadblocks took place”. The Government ’ s contention that further damage could have been caused to public safety ( see paragraph 189 below) was pure speculation."

On the contrary, the roadblocks had been symbolic and aimed at attracting the government ’ s attention. B.M. and A.K., who were respected by the farmers, had maintained order among the demonstrators. Moreover, during the roadblocks, selected representatives of the farmers were still negotiating with the government in order to reach a compromise on milk prices. The farmers had acted calmly and had taken no action that would require police special units or the army to intervene to restrain them. Their intention was not to breach public order, but to peacefully demonstrate for social justice. Only one lawsuit for civil damage, in the amount of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290), had been upheld by a court (see paragraph 45 above). This amount was negligible when compared to what was at stake for the farmers."

Later on, those measures had been lifted. Subsequently, the Kaunas City District Court had imposed on the applicants a custodial sentence.

Similarly, the demonstration had not been authorised in Barraco, cited above, where the putting in place of the roadblocks had been sudden and unexpected and where before being charged the applicant had been requested to leave the motorway several times. Concerning the case-law of the ECJ, the applicants explained that in Schmidberger ( cited above ) the demonstration had lasted for two days on the main trunk route along which no goods carriers could pass, while the police had allegedly not taken any measures to ensure the free movement of goods; in the Commission case ( cited above ) the demonstrators had acted violently towards lorry drivers transporting agricultural products from foreign countries.

Following negotiations between farmers, dairy processors and the government, between March and June 2003 the government had adopted a number of decisions providing subsidies to milk producers in the sum of LTL 52,000,000 (approximately EUR 15,06 7, 000 ).

It had therefore not entailed any ban, even temporary, on the applicants ’ continuing their professional and political activities. One year after their conviction, the applicants had been discharged by the Supreme Court upon the expiry of the term of their suspended sentences ( see paragraph 60 above).

The fact that, several days before the demonstration, the Klaipėda regional police had accidentally learned about the demonstrators ’ intentions to block the roads could not be regarded as a “decent notification” allowing the authorities to take appropriate measures.

At the same time, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion ( see Ezelin, § 53; Galstyan, § 115; and Barraco, § 44, all cited above ).

In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman, § 42; Bukta and Others, § 37; Nurettin Aldemir and Others, § 46; Ashughyan, § 90; Éva Molnár, § 36; Barraco, § 43; Berladir and Others, § 38; Fáber, § 47, all cited above; and İzci v.

The method used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 119). Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate, even though the Court acknowledged that the event could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 38-44 )."

As indicated by the Government and not contested by the applicants, these were the country ’ s three major highways.

Having examined the material at their disposal, the domestic courts and the Kalvarija and Pasvalys police (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above) came to the conclusion that the roadblocks had created a significant inconvenience for the flow of goods vehicles and private cars, with ensuing traffic jams and long queues of vehicles. These lasted for more than forty-eight hours, as the roadblocks were lifted only on 23 May 2003. It is not normally within the province of the European Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, inter alia, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B; Vidal v.

The decision of the farmers to move onto the highways and to use the tractors could not but be an attempt to block or reduce the passage of vehicles and create chaos in order to draw attention to the farmers ’ needs. The intentional roadblocks could not but have been aimed at pressuring the government to accept the farmers ’ demands, as shown by the fact that they were lifted as soon as the demonstrators had been informed of the successful outcome of the negotiations (see paragraphs 22 and 28 above).

In Drieman and Others (cited above ), Greenpeace activists had manoeuvred dinghies in such a way as to physically obstruct whaling, forcing the whalers to abandon their lawful exploitation of the living resources in Norway ’ s exclusive economic zone. In these two cases, the Court considered that the inflicting of sanctions ( in Steel and Others, forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment for the obstruction of the hunt and seventeen hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days ’ imprisonment for the protest against the construction of the motorway; in Drieman and Others, two days ’ detention on remand, fines convertible into imprisonment in case of default on payment and confiscation of a dinghy ) was a reaction proportionate to, inter alia, the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others. The Court considers that the same conclusion should a fortiori be reached in the present case, where the actions of the demonstrators had not been directly aimed at an activity of which they disapproved, but at the physical blocking of another activity (the use of highways by goods vehicles and private cars) which had no direct connection with the object of their protest, namely the government ’ s alleged lack of action vis-à-vis the decrease in the prices of some agricultural products."

It also reiterates that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law together with case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see the restatement of the relevant principles in Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 50, ECHR 2015). The Court further notes that in their observations before the Grand Chamber, the applicants did not specifically address the complaint that they had raised before the Chamber under Article 7 of the Convention.

The Court notes that the interference in the present cases amounted to the applicants ’ being arrested and sentenced to “administrative” detention in order to prevent their participation in the demonstration of 2 April 2011 and to punish them for having participated in opposition protests. The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for “ minor hooliganism ” and for “ failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer ” respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures. The Court cannot but agree with the applicants that the interference with their freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107 )."

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 100, 15 October 2015 ). States must not only safeguard the right to assemble peacefully but must also refrain from applying unreasonable indirect restrictions upon that right (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). In Djavit An v. Turkey the Court considered that the refusals to grant permits to the applicant in order to cross into southern Cyprus had in effect barred his participation in bi-communal meetings there, preventing him consequently from engaging in peaceful assembly with people from both communities. The Court observed that hindrance could amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment (see Djavit An, cited above, § 61 and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI)."

The applicants alleged that the true reason behind their arrest and conviction had been to punish them for their political activity and to prevent them from attending the demonstration of 2 April 2011. The Government claimed that the reasons for the applicants ’ arrest and conviction were not related to any public assembly."

            [
                "86. The Court notes that in essence the parties are disputing the factual basis for the applicants ’ convictions. The Court has emphasised on many occasions that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, § 135, 24 February 2005). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, however, is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, although in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 269, and Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 283, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII (extracts)). The Court has previously applied this reasoning in the context of Article 11 of the Convention (see Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, §§ 92-99, 10 April 2012 and, mutatis mutandis, Europapress Holding d.o.o. v. Croatia, no. 25333/06, § 62, 22 October 2009)."

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII)."

The demonstrations were held, inter alia, on 11 and 12 March 2011, 2 and 17 April 2011, 22 May 2011, and 19 June 2011. A number of international and domestic reports alleged that during the same period, the authorities had resorted to various seemingly arbitrary measures to quell support for the opposition (see paragraphs 67-76 above). The “ Observations on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan ” of 29 September 2011 adopted by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe stated, in particular, that “ [o] ne of the Commissioner ’ s recommendations to the Azerbaijani authorities was to end practices of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists or others who may express critical opinions ”. It noted that despite those recommendations, “ resort to such methods has apparently not abated” (see paragraph 67 above). The European Parliament in its Resolution of 12 May 2011 on Azerbaijan stated that it deplored “ the practice of intimidating, arresting, prosecuting and convicting independent journalists and political activists on various criminal charges [and] the arrest of around 200 people prior to, and during, the anti-government protests of 2 April 2011 in Baku ”. It called on the Azerbaijani authorities to allow peaceful protest as well as freedom of assembly (see paragraph 7 0 above)."

It follows from those reports that pre - emptive and/or retaliatory arrests and convictions under the Criminal Code or the CAO were widely used by the authorities to supress support for the opposition. The legal grounds used for detention of opposition activists were quite diverse and included grounds under the Criminal Code such as possession of drugs, possession of arms, evading military service, resistance to arrest and hooliganism, as well as grounds under the CAO such as failure to obey an order of a police officer and violation of traffic rules or otherwise disturbing public order. Opposition activists were reported to have been accused of disobeying a police officer for, for example, failing to produce an identity document or using foul language on the telephone."

It emerges clearly from the various sources cited above that, at the material time, opposition activists were routinely deterred or prevented from participating in demonstrations; were punished for having done so; and were punished for advocating or showing support for those demonstrations. This was done by resorting to the procedure of administrative detention under various substantive provisions of the CAO ( compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, §§ 90-92 )."

Thus, according to the official records, all three applicants were arrested on the street for offences related to breach of public order, and none of them resisted being taken into police custody. The first applicant was accused of disobeying an order to show an identity document. Police officers had allegedly mistaken him for a person on a wanted list and had therefore stopped his car and demanded his identity document. However, neither the name of the wanted person, nor his specific features that had led the police officers to suspect the applicant were ever indicated by the police or the domestic courts. The second and third applicants were accused of swearing aloud at no one in particular and for no apparent reason. It is remarkable that neither of those charges, which were practically identical, provided sufficient details of the acts attributed to the applicants.

The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for “ minor hooliganism ” and for “ failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer ” respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures. The Court cannot but agree with the applicants that the interference with their freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107 )."

In addition, the Court emphasises that under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, an accused is entitled to legal assistance which is practical and effective and not theoretical or illusory. This Convention provision speaks of “assistance” and not of “nomination”: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76). The Court notes that in the case of the first applicant, a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage. There is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest, however, that before the opening of the first-instance court hearing he was afforded the time and facilities to organise a proper defence. The Court also observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant ’ s behalf. In his oral submissions the lawyer simply stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to terminate the administrative proceedings against him. These circumstances give reason to believe that the representation by the State-funded lawyer was of a formalistic nature.

Their judgments did not contain any analysis as to what the alleged differences were between the declared aims of the picket and the contents of the article which the applicant had distributed during the picket. In this connection the Court reiterates that any measures interfering with the freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles – however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities – do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, the ideas which challenge the existing order must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 97, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX). The materials distributed by the applicant and the ideas he advocated during the picket were not shown to contain any defamatory statements, incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles. Accordingly, however unpleasant the call for dismissal of the President of the Regional Court may have been to him and however insulting he may have considered the article alleging corruption in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, it was not a relevant or sufficient ground for imposing liability on the applicant for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and assembly."

The picket had been organised by Mr Kuznetsov, Mr Sh. and Ms M., who at 9 a.m. on the day of the picket were standing on the staircase at the entrance to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court and thus obstructing access to the building.

As regards the necessity test, the Court reiterates that the right of peaceful assembly enshrined in Article 11 is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, one of the foundations of such a society. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with the rights enshrined in that Article is one that may claim to spring from “democratic society” (see Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v.

In view of the essential nature of freedom of assembly and its close relationship with democracy there must be convincing and compelling reasons to justify an interference with this right (see Ouranio Toxo v. Greece, no. 74989/01, § 36, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts), and Adalı v. Turkey, no. 38187/97, § 267, 31 March 2005, with further references)."

In carrying out its scrutiny of the interference complained of, the Court has to ascertain whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith. It must also look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Articles 10 and 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, Christian Democratic People ’ s Party, § 70, cited above )."

As far as the first ground is concerned, the Court reiterates that the subjection of public assemblies to an authorisation or notification procedure does not normally encroach upon the essence of the right as long as the purpose of the procedure is to allow the authorities to take reasonable and appropriate measures in order to guarantee the smooth conduct of any assembly, meeting or other gathering, be it political, cultural or of another nature (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 35, ECHR 2007 ‑ ...; Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, 5 December 2006, § 39; Rassemblement Jurassien Unité v.

                "43. It is undisputed that in the instant case the applicant submitted the picket notice eight days before the planned event, whereas the applicable regulations stipulated a ten-day notification. However, it does not appear that the two-day difference in any way impaired the authorities ’ ability to make necessary preparations for the picket. It appears that, given the small scale of the planned event, the town administration did not consider the alleged delay in notification relevant or important. Not only did it promptly acknowledge receipt of the picket notice, but also gave orders to the police five days in advance to ensure public order at the event. The delay was not held against the applicant in any official documents and did not affect the lawfulness of the picket. In fact, that transgression surfaced for the first time in the report on the administrative offence, which was compiled six weeks after the assembly. In these circumstances, the Court considers that a merely formal breach of the notification time-limit was neither relevant nor a sufficient reason for imposing administrative liability on the applicant. In this connection the Court emphasises that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as this person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53)."
            ],
            [
                "44. Where the alleged blocking of passage is concerned, the Court notes that the picket, in which just a few persons participated, began at about 9 a.m. at the top of the stairs leading to the entrance to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court. Shortly afterwards the court bailiffs and a police officer approached the participants and asked them to go down the stairs. They complied with the request and continued to picket in front of the staircase. The witnesses who arrived at 9.30 a.m. saw the applicant and his colleagues, who were already on the pavement downstairs. The Court considers the following elements important for the assessment of this situation. Firstly, it is undisputed that there were no complaints by anyone, whether individual visitors, judges or court employees, about the alleged obstruction of entry to the court-house by the picket participants. Secondly, even assuming that the presence of several individuals on top of the staircase did restrict access to the entrance door, it is creditable that the applicant diligently complied with the officials ’ request and without further argument descended the stairs onto the pavement. Thirdly, it is notable that the alleged hindrance was of an extremely short duration. Finally, as a general principle, the Court reiterates that any demonstration in a public place inevitably causes a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, and that it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Galstyan, §§ 116-117; Bukta, § 37; and Oya Ataman, §§ 38-42, all cited above). Accordingly, the Court is not satisfied that the alleged obstruction of passage, especially in the circumstances where the applicant gave evidence of his flexibility and readiness to cooperate with the authorities, was a relevant and sufficient reason for the interference."

                "45. As to the third ground for the applicant ’ s conviction, the Court observes that the domestic courts omitted to indicate any factual basis for their findings on that issue. Their judgments did not contain any analysis as to what the alleged differences were between the declared aims of the picket and the contents of the article which the applicant had distributed during the picket. In this connection the Court reiterates that any measures interfering with the freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles – however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities – do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, the ideas which challenge the existing order must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 97, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX). The materials distributed by the applicant and the ideas he advocated during the picket were not shown to contain any defamatory statements, incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles. Accordingly, however unpleasant the call for dismissal of the President of the Regional Court may have been to him and however insulting he may have considered the article alleging corruption in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, it was not a relevant or sufficient ground for imposing liability on the applicant for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and assembly."

It is also a matter of concern for the Court that the alleged discrepancy between the aims of the picket and the disseminated materials was raised for the first time in the letter by the deputy President of the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, that is the official reporting directly to the President of the Regional Court who had been the target of criticism in the distributed publications. The terms employed in the deputy president ’ s letter, such as the statement that the picket participants had “committed thereby an administrative offence”, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority and expressed the opinion that the applicant was guilty even before he had been proved guilty according to law (compare Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

This serious matter was undeniably part of a political debate on a matter of general and public concern. The Court reiterates in this connection that it has been its constant approach to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political speech or serious matters of public interest such as corruption in the judiciary, as broad restrictions imposed in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the State concerned (see, with necessary changes made, Karman v. Russia, no. 29372/02, § 36, 14 December 2006; Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV).

Such caution is an agent for broadening rather than narrowing the margin of appreciation/ambit of discretionary judgement of a Contracting State in this context, just as it may be in the context of other important and sensitive issues peculiar to a Contracting State’s traditions, to which its authorities – like those of Ireland in Murphy – are peculiarly alive and well qualified to assess.",

They would be well placed to know what manner of groups there were or might be who would take advantage of degrees of alteration to the present ban. It is not contestable that Parliament, through its MPs and politically active peers, is far better placed to reach a judgment on those matters than judges.

It was not of any great use save to demonstrate that there was a general consensus that electoral periods justified advertising prohibitions and that there was no clear consensus as to whether the present prohibition was necessary outside of an electoral period. Various states had decided what restrictions were necessary given their particular political sensitivities and broadcasting systems.

Both judges considered it legitimate to single out the broadcast media as its impact was potentially more powerful: Ousley J finding that it was not a matter of serious debate that the broadcast media was more pervasive and potent than any other media form. As to the debate about whether television was more expensive than other media, Ousley J considered it sufficient to accept that broadcasted advertisements had an advantage of which advertisers and broadcasters were aware and for which the former would pay large sums of money far beyond the reach of regular groups who would wish to participate in the public debate."

Finally, both judges rejected the argument that the prohibition was disproportionate as it applied outside electoral periods and to groups such as the applicant who were not associated with party politics or electoral campaigns.

Both judges considered that political advertising in the broadcast media outside such periods was likely to have an equally obvious influence on the democratic process. In this respect, Ousley J noted that the broadcast media were ever-present, that contentious democratic issues could arise at any time and that purchased influence could affect the promotion of legislation, the decision to hold an election or its ultimate outcome. Both judges also considered that it was impracticable, arbitrary and potentially unfair to attempt to draw a line between party political matters and other matters of public importance: the distortion of the political debate could take many forms and could embrace a vast range of matters of public interest and certain issues would be difficult to categorise. There was also a risk that such a distinction might allow political parties to “contract out” their political advertising to “splinter or supporter groups” which would be free from restriction."

It must be assumed that, given time, the public will make a sound choice when, in the course of the democratic process, it has the right to choose. But it is highly desirable that the playing field of debate should be so far as practicable level. This is achieved where, in public discussion, differing views are expressed, contradicted, answered and debated. It is the duty of broadcasters to achieve this object in an impartial way by presenting balanced programmes in which all lawful views may be ventilated.”"

While the JCHR had requested a compromise solution, the Government had judged that no fair and workable compromise solution could be found which would address the problem, “a judgment which Parliament accepted. I see no reason to challenge that judgment”. Parliament’s judgment was to be given “great weight” for three reasons. In the first place, it was reasonable to expect that democratically-elected politicians would be “peculiarly sensitive” to the measures necessary to safeguard the integrity of democracy. Secondly, while Parliament considered that the prohibition might “possibly although improbably” infringe Article 10, Parliament had resolved to proceed because of the importance it attached to the prohibition and its judgment which should not be “lightly overridden”. Thirdly, legislation could not be framed to address particular cases but had to lay down general rules and Parliament would decide where the line would be. While that inevitably meant that hard cases would fall on the wrong side of the line, “that should not be held to invalidate the rule if, judged in the round, it is beneficial.”"

As a result, there might be respects in which sections 319 and 321 were incompatible with Article 10. However, the power to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the HRA was a discretionary one. As a general rule it ought not to be exercised unless the circumstances of the case showed that the legislative provision in question had “affected a Convention right of the applicant ... in a manner that is incompatible with that right” and hypothetical examples of ways in which the legislative provision might be incompatible with a Convention right did not suffice.

Important though political speech is, the political rights of others are equally important in a democracy. The issue is whether the ban, as it applies to these facts, was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting the democratic rights of others. As Lord Bingham has demonstrated, Government and Parliament have recently examined with some care whether a more limited ban could be made to work and have concluded that it could not. The solution chosen has all-party support. Parliamentarians of all political persuasions take the view that the ban is necessary in this democratic society. Any court would be slow indeed to take a different view on a question such as this. There may be room for argument at the very margins of the rule, for example, in banning any advertisement of any kind by a political body, or in banning any advertisement by anyone of matters of public controversy.

During election campaigns, television viewers and radio listeners are not subjected to a continuous barrage of party political propaganda (much of which, if it were permitted here, would undoubtedly be negative). The parties’ dependence on wealthy donors is reduced. Political leaders are not forced to spend enormous amounts of time and energy raising money to fund television and radio campaigns. Not least of the benefits is the fact that the broadcasters provide the parties with free air-time. This means that all the major political parties, and not just the richest ones, are given an opportunity to state their views.

If a court were in the future to rule to the contrary, this would potentially have a dramatic effect on the funding of the political parties. If free to do so, the parties would almost certainly feel obliged to make use of the opportunity to advertise themselves (or attack their opponents) on television and radio.

On 10 December 2002 the Secretary of State of the DCMS responded to an MP’s query as to the Convention compatibility of the prohibition enclosing a detailed DCMS “Explanatory Note” setting out the Government’s reasons for maintaining the prohibition. The DCMS Explanatory note recorded that, while the VgT case had called into question whether the prohibition was compatible with the Convention, the prohibition had enjoyed wide and cross-party support and was strongly supported by the Neill Committee. The pre-legislative scrutiny committee and the JCHR supported the principles behind the prohibition and had urged the Government to examine ways of ensuring that it was Convention-compatible. The Government had taken appropriate advice. A more certainly Convention-compatible prohibition could only be achieved by a significant shift in the approach to the prohibition which would open the way “at the very least to substantial advertising by lobby groups and issue campaigners”. Moreover, there was a “very strong case” that the prohibition was ECHR compatible which was why the Government asked Parliament to proceed with the Bill with the prohibition intact.",

                "8. The conclusion was reached, taking account of legal advice, that it would be very difficult to make such a scheme workable, and that in any event it would fall significantly short of the present outright ban, and allow a substantial degree of political advertising to be broadcast across a number of channels.”",

He also expressed the view that the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Swiss case was unconvincing and that there were strong arguments to justify a domestic court and the European Court itself not following that decision in the present context.",

On 13 January 2003 the Electoral Commission (an independent body established by Parliament to keep under review a range of electoral and political matters) published a report entitled “Party Political Broadcasting: Report and Recommendations”. It considered the case for the prohibition to be persuasive. A principal concern was to avoid those with higher financial resources from hijacking the political agenda in that the electorate would receive information only from a very small number of well-financed (large) political parties. It would also be difficult for the broadcasters to maintain balance and impartiality. International comparisons did little to alleviate concerns regarding the impact of paid advertising, the Commission referring to experiences in the United States and to Germany where, despite reduced rates for advertising, only the largest parties had the resources for such advertising. Notwithstanding the VgT judgment, the proposed prohibition could be justified under Article 10(2) of the Convention (pages 16-17 of the Report):",
                "“...it is to be noted that the [ VgT ] case was concerned with paid political advertising in general and not with political party advertising within a context where the ban on paid advertising operated alongside a regime of free broadcasts which are essentially unmediated by the broadcasters. Such a [regime] has not been the subject of a ruling either in Strasbourg or by our own courts under the Human Rights Act. ... [it] is undoubtedly a counterbalance to the ban on paid advertising. While it does not offset the ban in its entirety ...we nevertheless consider it to be a significant counterbalance because it applies principally at the time of elections.",

Ireland, no. 44179/98, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts)) and that was not the situation in the present case.

While the applicant accepted the necessity of the prohibition during pre-election periods, it considered disproportionate its maintenance outside those periods for social advocacy groups on matters of public interest. A prohibition distinguishing “party politics” and public interest social advocacy would be principled, feasible and proportionate. According to the applicant, a distinction had been made between the two notions in section 321(3) of the 2003 Act and other States had made this distinction. The wide definition unjustifiably restricted the ability of small campaign groups to engage with the public on matters of general interest. It created a monopoly in favour of established political parties who had access, albeit regulated, to the broadcast media via free party political and party electoral broadcasts. The prohibition therefore distorted the public debate. Finally, it was financially burdensome to set up a charitable arm to broadcast an advertisement on a non-political matter so that the prohibition favoured well-funded bodies."

The Government had presumed that the broadcast media was uniquely powerful and expensive without any proof, analysis or comparative studies. Given the growing impact of other forms of pervasive media, there were convincing reasons to believe that those ideas might now be false. The Government incorrectly relied on the prior findings of this Court as to the power of the audio-visual media. In any event, it made no sense to restrict access to the broadcast media and allow access to other persuasive and pervasive media. If the broadcast media was particularly powerful, that would be a reason to broadcast political speech and if it was no longer that powerful compared, for example, to the internet, the State’s justification for the prohibition fell away. The Government’s aim of preventing the hijacking of the broadcast media by the rich and powerful was not achieved because everyone (rich and poor) was excluded from broadcasting but the rich could nonetheless still monopolise other powerful media."

The VgT and TV Vest cases could not be confined to their own facts. Whether or not the applicant was responding to or launching a debate, it was the public interest nature of the expression which was determinative in VgT and should be so in the present case. As the TV Vest judgment indicated, the particular sensitivities to which the expression of religious views gave rise meant that the Murphy case was distinguishable. Moreover, the argument that the VgT judgment was erroneous was not persuasive: that judgment had been considered and confirmed three times ( Murphy, VgT No. 2 and TV Vest ) and there was nothing new or compelling in the Government’s pleadings.

The regulatory regime chosen was designed to balance, on the one hand, freedom of political speech and, on the other, the impartiality of that speech and the protection of the democratic process. These important latter aims were achieved by three interrelated mechanisms: the prohibition; the statutory duty of impartiality placed solely on broadcasters (section 320 of the 2003 Act); and free party political, party election and referendum campaign broadcasts. It was the proportionality of the prohibition as a general measure that had to be examined as opposed to its application to the facts of the case.

Moreover, the Government argued that Court’s function was limited to reviewing whether or not the solution adopted by Parliament could be regarded as striking a fair balance and falling within an applicable margin of appreciation. Even though the case involved political speech, the aim was maintaining its integrity and impartiality. TV Vest had acknowledged that the lack of consensus favoured a somewhat wider margin of appreciation. It was a fine balance of competing interests, which involved the detailed consideration and rejection of less restrictive alternatives by various expert bodies and democratically-elected politicians who were peculiarly sensitive to the measures necessary to safeguard the integrity of the democratic process. Parliament was entitled to judge that the objective justified the prohibition and it was adopted without dissent. It was then scrutinised by the national courts which endorsed the reasons for, and scope of, the prohibition. Accordingly, and given the margin of appreciation applicable, this Court should be slow to second-guess the solution carefully identified in a complex area by the relevant domestic bodies. As to the alleged conflict of interest of the political establishment in assessing the necessity of a prohibition, the experience in the United States showed that an unregulated system favoured politicians and would not benefit a minority party."

If a prohibition during electoral periods would be consistent with Article 10 (as the applicant accepted) to protect the electoral process, it was a question of fact and degree to what extent it was necessary to have a prohibition at other times for the same objective. They underlined that the prohibition could not be limited to political parties. It would be easily circumvented by parties hiding behind public interest groups thereby distorting the political agenda. Moreover, there was no clear and workable distinction between political parties and social advocacy bodies. They emphasised that attempting to avoid political content would not be realistic as it was difficult to imagine a social advocacy body whose advert did not seek to promote its objectives. Indeed, any advertisement by such a body would advance its political purposes, if only by increasing name recognition or assisting fund raising. If a body wished to advertise on a non-political matter, all it had to do (as many have done) was to set up a charitable arm. Finally, they stressed that placing financial caps on groups seeking to broadcast advertisements could easily be circumvented by deep pockets distributing funds to a variety of aligned groups or to groups created for that purpose. Financial caps on certain political viewpoints would also be difficult to objectively draft and operate. Limiting the number of political broadcasting slots available would inevitably give rise to questions of unfairness and discrimination whereas it was feasible to devise rules for the allocation of party political broadcasts by reference to registered political parties and/or elections results."

Switzerland, §§ 70 and 72; and Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland, §§ 59-61, the latter two cited above). The margin is also narrowed by the strong interest of a democratic society in the press exercising its vital role as a public watchdog ( Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV): freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on subjects of public interest and the public also has a right to receive them ( Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; and Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v.

It emerges from that case-law that, in order to determine the proportionality of a general measure, the Court must primarily assess the legislative choices underlying it ( James and Others, § 36). The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation (for example, Hatton, at § 128; Murphy, at § 73; Hirst at §§ 78-80; Evans, at § 86; and Dickson, at § 83, all cited above). It is also relevant to take into account the risk of abuse if a general measure were to be relaxed, that being a risk which is primarily for the State to assess ( Pretty, § 74). A general measure has been found to be a more feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim than a provision allowing a case-by-case examination, when the latter would give rise to a risk of significant uncertainty ( Evans, § 89), of litigation, expense and delay ( James and Others, § 68 and Runkee, § 39) as well as of discrimination and arbitrariness ( Murphy, at §§ 76-77 and Evans, § 89).

Rather the core issue is whether, in adopting the general measure and striking the balance it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it ( James and Others v. the United Kingdom, § 51; Mellacher and Others v.

The applicant contested the relevance of that case as it concerned a restriction which only operated prior to and during elections. While the risk to pluralist public debates, elections and the democratic process would evidently be more acute during an electoral period, the Bowman judgment does not suggest that that risk is confined to such periods since the democratic process is a continuing one to be nurtured at all times by a free and pluralist public debate. Indeed, in Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v. Italy ( cited above, § 134), the Court did not suggest that the recognition of a positive obligation to intervene to guarantee effective pluralism in the audiovisual sector was limited to a particular period.",
                "Accordingly, it is relevant to recall that there is a wealth of historical, cultural and political differences within Europe so that it is for each State to mould its own democratic vision ( Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], § 61; and Scoppola v. Italy (no. 3) [GC], § 83, both cited above). By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, their societies and their needs, the legislative and judicial authorities are best placed to assess the particular difficulties in safeguarding the democratic order in their State ( Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], cited above, § 134). The State must therefore be accorded some discretion as regards this country-specific and complex assessment which is of central relevance to the legislative choices at issue in the present case."

Finally, the Court notes that both parties have the same objective namely, the maintenance of a free and pluralist debate on matters of public interest and, more generally, contributing to the democratic process. The Court is required therefore to balance, on the one hand, the applicant NGO’s right to impart information and ideas of general interest which the public is entitled to receive with, on the other, the authorities’ desire to protect the democratic debate and process from distortion by powerful financial groups with advantageous access to influential media. The Court recognises that such groups could obtain competitive advantages in the area of paid advertising and thereby curtail a free and pluralist debate, of which the State remains the ultimate guarantor. Regulation of the broadcasted public interest debate can therefore be necessary within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. While both the VgT and TV Vest judgments expressly accepted that principle (see also, for example, the above-cited case of Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v. Italy), each found the operation of the prohibitions on advertising at issue in those cases to be disproportionate. The issue to be resolved in this case is whether the present prohibition has gone too far, having regard to its objective described above and to the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State."

Although the prohibition had been an integral part of broadcasting in the United Kingdom since the 1950s, its necessity was specifically reviewed and confirmed by the Neill Committee in its report of 1998. A White Paper with a proposed prohibition was therefore published for comment. It was at this point (2001) that the above-cited VgT judgment was delivered and all later stages of the pre-legislative review examined in detail the impact of this judgment on the Convention compatibility of the proposed prohibition. Following the White Paper consultation, in 2002 a draft Bill was published with a detailed Explanatory Note which dealt with the implications of the VgT judgment. All later specialist bodies consulted on that Bill (the JCHR, the JCDCB, the ITC and the Electoral Commission) were in favour, for reasons set out in detail above (paragraphs 42-54), of maintaining the prohibition considering that, even after the VgT judgment, it was a proportionate general measure. The Government, through the DCMS, played an important part in that debate explaining frequently and in detail their reasons for retaining the prohibition and for considering it to be proportionate and going so far as to disclose their legal advice on the subject (paragraphs 50-53 above). The 2003 Act containing the prohibition was then enacted with cross-party support and without any dissenting vote. The prohibition was therefore the culmination of an exceptional examination by parliamentary bodies of the cultural, political and legal aspects of the prohibition as part of the broader regulatory system governing broadcasted public interest expression in the United Kingdom and all bodies found the prohibition to have been a necessary interference with Article 10 rights."

The proportionality of the prohibition was, nonetheless, debated in some detail before the High Court and the House of Lords. Both courts analysed the relevant Convention case-law and principles, addressed the relevance of the above-cited VgT judgment and carefully applied that jurisprudence to the prohibition. Each judge at both levels endorsed the objective of the prohibition as well as the rationale of the legislative choices which defined its particular scope and each concluded that it was a necessary and proportionate interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention."

In addition, the Court considers it important that the prohibition was specifically circumscribed to address the precise risk of distortion the State sought to avoid with the minimum impairment of the right of expression. It only applies therefore to advertising given its inherently partial nature ( Murphy, at § 42), to paid advertising given the danger of unequal access based on wealth and to political advertising (as explained at paragraph 99 above) as it was considered to go to the heart of the democratic process. It is also confined to certain media (radio and television) since they are considered to be the most influential and expensive media and to constitute a cornerstone of the regulatory system at issue in the present case. The limits placed on a restriction are important factors in the assessment of its proportionality ( Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], § 75, cited above).

In the first place, the applicant argued, referring to paragraph 77 of the VgT judgment, that limiting the prohibition to radio and television was illogical given the comparative potency of newer media such as the internet. However, the Court considers coherent a distinction based on the particular influence of the broadcast media. In particular, the Court recognises the immediate and powerful effect of the broadcast media, an impact reinforced by the continuing function of radio and television as familiar sources of entertainment in the intimacy of the home ( Jersild v. Denmark, § 31; Murphy v. Ireland, § 74; TV Vest, at § 60; and Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v. Italy, § 132, all cited above). In addition, the choices inherent in the use of the internet and social media mean that the information emerging therefrom does not have the same synchronicity or impact as broadcasted information. Notwithstanding therefore the significant development of the internet and social media in recent years, there is no evidence of a sufficiently serious shift in the respective influences of the new and of the broadcast media in the respondent State to undermine the need for special measures for the latter."

The Court considers that it is sufficient to note, as did Ousley J in the High Court (paragraph 17 above), that broadcasted advertisements had an advantage of which advertisers and broadcasters were aware and for which advertisers would pay large sums of money, far beyond the reach of most NGOs who would wish to participate in the public debate."

Concerns about a less restrictive prohibition were accepted by the parliamentary and judicial authorities and essentially two concerns were re-emphasised by the Government before this Court: a risk of abuse and a risk of arbitrariness. The risk of abuse is to be primarily assessed by the domestic authorities (paragraph 108 above) and the Court considers it reasonable to fear that this option would give rise to a risk of wealthy bodies with agendas being fronted by social advocacy groups created for that precise purpose. Financial caps on advertising could be circumvented by those wealthy bodies creating a large number of similar interest groups, thereby accumulating advertising time. The Court also considers rational the concern that a prohibition requiring a case-by-case distinction between advertisers and advertisements might not be a feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim. In particular, having regard to the complex regulatory background, this form of control could lead to uncertainty, litigation, expense and delay as well as to allegations of discrimination and arbitrariness, these being reasons which can justify a general measure (paragraph 108 above). It was reasonable therefore for the Government to fear that the proposed alternative option was not feasible and that it might compromise the principle of broadcasting impartiality, a cornerstone of the regulatory system at issue (paragraphs 62-64)."

Moreover, the Court would underline that there is no European consensus between Contracting States on how to regulate paid political advertising in broadcasting (paragraphs 65-72 above) and the parties accepted this. It is recalled that a lack of a relevant consensus amongst Contracting States could speak in favour of allowing a somewhat wider margin of appreciation than that normally afforded to restrictions on expression on matters of public interest ( Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], § 81 and TV Vest, § 67, both cited above, as well as Société de conception de presse et d’édition and Ponson v. France, no. 26935/05, §§ 57 and 63, 5 March 2009). It is true that EPRA recommended some caution when relying on comparative material in this context (paragraph 65 above). However, while there may be a trend away from broad prohibitions, it remains clear that there is a substantial variety of means employed by the Contracting States to regulate such advertising, reflecting the wealth of differences in historical development, cultural diversity, political thought and, consequently, democratic vision of those States ( Scoppola v. Italy (no. 3) [GC], cited above, § 83). Such is the lack of consensus in this area that the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in considering the issue of paid political advertising in the broadcast media in 1999 and 2007, declined to recommend a common position on the issue (paragraphs 73-75 above). This lack of consensus also broadens the margin of appreciation to be accorded as regards restrictions on public interest expression."

Switzerland, cited above, §§ 73-75). In particular, it remains open to the applicant NGO to participate in radio or television discussion programmes of a political nature (ie. broadcasts other than paid advertisements). It can also advertise on radio and television on a non-political matter if it sets up a charitable arm to do so and it has not been demonstrated that the costs of this are prohibitive. Importantly, the applicant has full access for its advertisement to non ‑ broadcasting media including the print media, the internet (including social media) as well as to demonstrations, posters and flyers. Even if it has not been shown that the internet, with its social media, is more influential than the broadcast media in the respondent State (paragraph 119 above), those new media remain powerful communication tools which can be of significant assistance to the applicant NGO in achieving its own objectives."

The prosecutor referred to Article 11 of the Convention and argued that university grounds could not be regarded as public places within the meaning of Law no. 2911 and that the applicants ’ and their fellow students ’ actions could not therefore be regarded to be in breach of that Law. The students ’ failure to hold their meeting in a place other than the one for which permission had been granted could only be regarded as a disciplinary issue and dealt with by the university administration and not by courts of law."

To that end the Court notes, firstly, that even if the applicants are acquitted at the end of the criminal proceedings, such an acquittal would not alter the fact that there has already been an interference with the applicants ’ rights under Article 11 of the Convention on account of the gendarmes ’ intervention in the meeting and the applicants ’ subsequent arrest (see paragraph 36 above)."

Therefore, in order to enable the domestic authorities to take the necessary preventive security measures, associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, should respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force.

                "51. On 14 January 2005 the Kaunas Regional Court found that the District Court had thoroughly and impartially assessed all the circumstances of the case. The Regional Court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, public safety and public health, human dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers ’ actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order."

It noted that by driving tractors onto the highway, thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the State border - control service, and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road, the three applicants had seriously breached public order. The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness. The Regional Court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative - law offence such as a traffic violation. As to the applicants ’ argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer, A.D., had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation (see paragraph 49 above), the Regional Court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence."

Analogous limitations to freedom of expression were listed in Article 25 of the Lithuanian Constitution (see paragraph 61 below). On this issue, the Regional Court emphasised that the behaviour of B.M. and A.K., in guiding the actions of the other individuals involved in the protest, could not be regarded as a non-punishable expression of their opinion, because they had breached public order, thus engaging criminal liability."

In providing an explanation as to the substance of the offence of rioting, as defined in Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 below), the Supreme Court referred to its classification as an offence against public order, which was the objective aspect of the crime ( nusikaltimo objektas ). In describing the scope of the offence, the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features: the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence, damaging property or otherwise breaching public order, or the commission of those actions during a gathering. For the Supreme Court, a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order, caused public violence, or damaged property. The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent ( kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia ). The guilty person had to ( i ) be aware that he or she was performing an action that was listed as an offence in Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code; and (ii) wish to act accordingly."

In particular, the trial court had properly established all the prerequisites for the application of Article 283 § 1, namely that there had been a crowd and that public order had been breached by blocking the highways, stopping traffic and disturbing the work of the State border - control service. The applicants had been sentenced for their offences under a law in force at the time they were committed and their sentences had been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.

France ( C ‑ 265/95, judgment of 9 December 1997 – “the Commission case” ), concerning serious incidents which occurred in the south of France. Agricultural products from Spain and Italy had been destroyed by French farmers and acts of violence and vandalism had been committed in the relevant wholesale and retail sectors. The ECJ emphasised that, in accordance with the EC Treaty, the European internal market was characterised by the abolition, between member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods. Article 30 of the Treaty prohibited, between member States, quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. Therefore, all barriers, whether direct or indirect, actual or potential, to flows of imports in intra-Community trade had to be eliminated. Article 30, read in conjunction with Article 5 of the Treaty, also applied where a member State abstained from adopting the measures required in order to deal with obstacles to the free movement of goods which were not caused by the State."

                "72. The ECJ accepted that States enjoyed a margin of discretion in determining what measures were more appropriate in this field. It was, however, clear that the acts of violence committed in France against agricultural products originating in other member States created obstacles to intra-Community trade in those products. The incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years; in certain cases the French authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers, the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism, committed by persons whose faces were often not covered, had been filmed by television cameras. In spite of this, only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. This was sufficient for the ECJ to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the French government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-Community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30, taken in conjunction with Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of French farmers could not justify a failure to apply Community Law correctly, as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the State could not cope. It was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might, in appropriate cases, justify non-intervention by the police; however, this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident, and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue.",

The case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the Austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the Brenner motorway, the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours. In conjunction with a pre-existing, national, generally applicable ban on holiday driving, this caused the Brenner motorway (an essential intra-Community transit route) to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days, with a short interruption of a few hours."

It went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified. It observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member State under the EC Treaty, only the objective pursued by the national authorities, namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, being relevant. Both the free movement of goods, one of the fundamental principles of the EC Treaty, and the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest.

Under these circumstances, Austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly, and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions. In this respect, the ECJ stated as follows.",

However, they did not rely on any provision of the Convention or of the Rules of Court, nor did they point to any specific fact or circumstance which could be viewed as a shortcoming for the purposes of Rules 44A (Duty to cooperate with the Court), 44B (Failure to comply with an order of the Court), 44C (Failure to participate effectively) or 44D (Inappropriate submissions by a party) of the said Rules or which otherwise calls into question the conduct of the proceedings before the panel of five judges which examined the Government ’ s request.

The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining the demonstration cannot as such take away that right ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 155 ).

In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v.

The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during a gathering and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39; Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, § 84, 3 October 2013; Primov and Others, cited above, § 93; and Nemtsov, cited above, § 73 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities. A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well. So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants, and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally ( see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 84, with further references )."

Indeed, the gatherings, even when the demonstrators resorted to roadblocks, were not dispersed by the police. However, the applicants were subsequently convicted because of their role in the organisation and implementation of the roadblocks during the latter part of the demonstrations. As already indicated above, their conduct in this respect, albeit reprehensible, was not deemed to have been violent in character.

In particular, the consequences of a given action need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

The government ’ s inaction and its unilateral decision to stop the negotiations with the farmers had significantly impoverished rural areas.

In such circumstances, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should have prevailed over any resulting minimal disturbances to the free movement of goods. In this connection, the applicants alleged that Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 (see paragraph 77 above) recognised roadblocks as a form of strike action."

Knowing that roadblocks were likely to occur, the police had prepared action plans and alternative itineraries in the vicinity of the demonstrations, thus reducing any possible disruption to the flow of goods. The farmers themselves had foreseen measures, which were fully implemented, to ensure that traffic was redirected onto secondary roads. According to the applicants, on the critical days the flow of traffic had been “even better than usual”. This was proven by the “data from posts where the roadblocks took place”. The Government ’ s contention that further damage could have been caused to public safety ( see paragraph 189 below) was pure speculation."

On the contrary, the roadblocks had been symbolic and aimed at attracting the government ’ s attention. B.M. and A.K., who were respected by the farmers, had maintained order among the demonstrators. Moreover, during the roadblocks, selected representatives of the farmers were still negotiating with the government in order to reach a compromise on milk prices. The farmers had acted calmly and had taken no action that would require police special units or the army to intervene to restrain them. Their intention was not to breach public order, but to peacefully demonstrate for social justice. Only one lawsuit for civil damage, in the amount of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290), had been upheld by a court (see paragraph 45 above). This amount was negligible when compared to what was at stake for the farmers."

The fact that, several days before the demonstration, the Klaipėda regional police had accidentally learned about the demonstrators ’ intentions to block the roads could not be regarded as a “decent notification” allowing the authorities to take appropriate measures.

As indicated by the Government and not contested by the applicants, these were the country ’ s three major highways. Moreover, between 3 and 4. 30 p.m. on 21 May 2003, the third, fourth and fifth applicants drove tractors onto the Kaunas- Marijampolė - Suvalkai highway and left them there, thus obstructing the flow of traffic (see paragraph 21 (c) above)."

The Court notes that the problems in the agricultural sector and the fall in the wholesale prices of agricultural products were an ongoing situation and the farmers ’ dissatisfaction continued as the government failed in their view to implement Parliament ’ s resolution of 22 April 2003 (see paragraph 13 above).

The Court further sees no reason to doubt the domestic courts ’ findings to the effect that the applicants were aware that the moving of the demonstration from the authorised locations onto the highways and the parking of the tractors on the Kaunas- Marijampolė - Suvalkai highway would provoke a major disruption to traffic. Having examined the material at their disposal, the domestic courts and the Kalvarija and Pasvalys police (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above) came to the conclusion that the roadblocks had created a significant inconvenience for the flow of goods vehicles and private cars, with ensuing traffic jams and long queues of vehicles. These lasted for more than forty-eight hours, as the roadblocks were lifted only on 23 May 2003. It is not normally within the province of the European Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, inter alia, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B; Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, §§ 33-34, Series A no. 235-B; and Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 29, Series A no. 269 ). No material has been adduced before this Court which could call into question the findings of the national courts and add weight to the applicants ’ allegations before the Court, disputed by the Government, that on the critical days the flow of goods had been “even better than usual” (see paragraphs 24 and 121 above)."

As long as the demonstrations took place in the designated locations, the flow of traffic was not affected. The decision of the farmers to move onto the highways and to use the tractors could not but be an attempt to block or reduce the passage of vehicles and create chaos in order to draw attention to the farmers ’ needs. The intentional roadblocks could not but have been aimed at pressuring the government to accept the farmers ’ demands, as shown by the fact that they were lifted as soon as the demonstrators had been informed of the successful outcome of the negotiations (see paragraphs 22 and 28 above). This feature distinguishes the present case from those in which the Court has observed that demonstrations may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption to traffic (see the case-law cited in paragraph 155 above)."

In Steel and Others ( cited above ) the first and second applicants had obstructed a hunt and had impeded engineering work for the construction of a motorway, respectively. In Drieman and Others (cited above ), Greenpeace activists had manoeuvred dinghies in such a way as to physically obstruct whaling, forcing the whalers to abandon their lawful exploitation of the living resources in Norway ’ s exclusive economic zone. In these two cases, the Court considered that the inflicting of sanctions ( in Steel and Others, forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment for the obstruction of the hunt and seventeen hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days ’ imprisonment for the protest against the construction of the motorway; in Drieman and Others, two days ’ detention on remand, fines convertible into imprisonment in case of default on payment and confiscation of a dinghy ) was a reaction proportionate to, inter alia, the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others. The Court considers that the same conclusion should a fortiori be reached in the present case, where the actions of the demonstrators had not been directly aimed at an activity of which they disapproved, but at the physical blocking of another activity (the use of highways by goods vehicles and private cars) which had no direct connection with the object of their protest, namely the government ’ s alleged lack of action vis-à-vis the decrease in the prices of some agricultural products."

As in Steel and Others and Drieman and Others (both cited above), the Court found that the sanctions imposed on the applicants (four hours ’ detention in a police van and a fine of 150 pounds sterling in Lucas, and a three - month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 1,500 euros in Barraco ) were “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention.

Even when the applicants refused to obey these lawful orders, the police chose not to disperse the gatherings. The farmers only decided to stop demonstrating when their demands had been met by the government (see paragraph 22 above). Moreover, when tensions arose between the farmers and the lorry drivers, the police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down in order to avoid serious confrontations ( see paragraph 28 above).

It also reiterates that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law together with case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see the restatement of the relevant principles in Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 50, ECHR 2015). The Court further notes that in their observations before the Grand Chamber, the applicants did not specifically address the complaint that they had raised before the Chamber under Article 7 of the Convention.

                "47. The Court reiterates that the national authorities have a wide discretion in determining the appropriate measures to be taken for the prevention of disorder at an assembly. In the circumstances it could be expected that one group might intend to disturb the MSZP assembly. For the Court, the police’s endeavour to prevent any clashes between the participants in the two assemblies falls within the authorities’ margin of appreciation granted in the prevention of violence and in the protection of demonstrators against fear of violence. The Court considers, however, that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that it cannot be restricted in any way, so long as the person concerned does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53). In the absence of additional elements, the Court, even accepting the provocative nature of the display of the flag, which remains prima facie an act of freedom of expression, cannot see the reasons for the intervention against the applicant. In this connection, the Court reiterates that, “where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance” ( Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2006–XIV). Given the applicant’s passive conduct, the distance from the MSZP demonstration and the absence of any demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance, it cannot be held that the reasons given by the national authorities to justify the interference complained of are relevant and sufficient."

The police supervising the scene called on the applicant either to remove the banner or leave. The applicant refused to do so, pointing out that this flag was a historical symbol and that no law forbade its display. Subsequently he was committed to the Budapest Gyorskocsi Police Holding Facility, where he was held in custody and under interrogation for six hours. After he had been released, the Budapest 5th District Police Department fined him 50,000 Hungarian forints (approximately 200 euros) for the regulatory offence of disobeying police instructions.

Despite the opinion of a heraldic expert, submitted by the applicant and stating that the flag in question was a historical one, the court considered its display offensive in the circumstances, because it had been placed higher than the national flag representing the Republic of Hungary.

In particular, the creation and rise of the radical right-wing Hungarian Guard (Magyar Gárda) – a group bearing close ties to a well known radical right-wing political party – is consistently cited as a cause for deep concern. Since its creation in August 2007 and the public swearing in of several hundred new members in October 2007, the Hungarian Guard has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country, including in villages with large Roma populations; despite apparently innocuous articles of association, amongst the group’s chief messages is the defence of ethnic Hungarians against so-called “Gypsy crime”. Members of the Hungarian Guard parade in matching, paramilitary-style black boots and uniforms, with insignia and flags closely resembling the flag of the Arrow Cross Party, an openly Nazi organisation that briefly held power in Hungary during World War II, and during whose spell in power tens of thousands of Jews and Roma were killed or deported.",

Insofar as the State party contends that displaying a banner turns their presence into a demonstration, the Committee notes that any restrictions upon the right to assemble must fall within the limitation provisions of article 21. A requirement to pre-notify a demonstration would normally be for reasons of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), in the context of cross burning (a traditional threatening activity of the Klu Klux Klan). According to this judgment, the burning of a cross is a “symbol of hate”, regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate. And while cross-burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not absolute, and the government may regulate certain categories of expression, including the ban of a “true threat”. Intimidation, in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word, is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The fact that cross-burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question. Sometimes the cross-burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. The Supreme Court required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross-burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross-burning was intended to intimidate.

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a “demonstrator” or a “counter-demonstrator”. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 106-107, 7 February 2012). The Court’s task is therefore to examine whether those authorities struck a fair balance between the interests of the protagonists. In order to do so, it is necessary to consider not only the general principles applicable to freedom of expression but also those applicable to freedom of assembly – which is of particular relevance for the determination of that balance.",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, § 39, ECHR 2003–V; and Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 56, ECHR 2001–VIII)."

When the right to freedom of expression is exercised in the context of political speech through the use of symbols, utmost care must be observed in applying any restrictions, especially if the case involves symbols which have multiple meanings. In this connection the Court emphasises that it is only by a careful examination of the context (see Öllinger v. Austria, no. 76900/01, § 47, ECHR 2006–IX), that one can draw a meaningful distinction between shocking and offensive language which is protected by Article 10 and that which forfeits its right to tolerance in a democratic society (see Vajnai v.

Any measures interfering with freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles – however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities – do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it (see Sergey Kuznetsov v.

The Court would add that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community.

For the Court, in the protection against such a disruption, a wide discretion is granted to the national authorities, not only because the two competing rights do, in principle, deserve equal protection that satisfies the obligation of neutrality of the State when opposing views clash, but also because those authorities are best positioned to evaluate the security risks and those of disturbance as well as the appropriate measures dictated by the risk assumption."

In the exercise of the State’s margin of appreciation, past violence at similar events and the impact of a counter-demonstration on the targeted demonstration are relevant considerations for the authorities, in so far as the danger of violent confrontation between the two groups – a general problem of public order – is concerned (see Öllinger, cited above, § 47). Experience with past disorders is less relevant where the situation, as in the present case, allows the authorities to take preventive measures, such as police presence keeping the two assemblies apart and offering a sufficient degree of protection, even if there was a history of violence at similar events necessitating police intervention. The Court would note in this context that it has not been argued that there was increased likelihood of violence due to the presence of the Árpád -striped banner or that the use of that symbol, perceived as provocative by the authorities, resulted in a clear threat or present danger of violence."

Nevertheless, no pressing social need to intervene was established, although there was a risk of protests by some visitors to the cemetery which could degenerate into an open conflict between them and those participating in the assembly. In that case the ban was a preliminary one based on assumptions about future events.",

For the Court, the police’s endeavour to prevent any clashes between the participants in the two assemblies falls within the authorities’ margin of appreciation granted in the prevention of violence and in the protection of demonstrators against fear of violence. The Court considers, however, that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that it cannot be restricted in any way, so long as the person concerned does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53). In the absence of additional elements, the Court, even accepting the provocative nature of the display of the flag, which remains prima facie an act of freedom of expression, cannot see the reasons for the intervention against the applicant. In this connection, the Court reiterates that, “where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance” ( Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2006–XIV).

The police forced the demonstrators back to a park next to the hotel where, after a while, they dispersed."

In the court ’ s view, the possible shortcomings of the Assembly Act could not be remedied by the courts.

Another important principle that transpires from the Court ’ s case- law is that participants in a demonstration which results in damage or other disorder but who do not themselves commit any violent or otherwise reprehensible acts cannot be prosecuted solely on the ground of their participation in the demonstration. Thus, in the case of Ezelin v. France the applicant was sentenced to a reprimand for participating in a demonstration which resulted in public property being damaged by offensive and insulting graffiti, the perpetrators of which were never identified. When finding a violation of Article 11, the Court held that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly was of such importance that a person could not be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration, so long as that person did not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53)."

They had not destroyed any property; the property had been in fact damaged by the arresting police officers. The participants in the protest had moreover compensated the damage in full. In those circumstances, her arrest, remand in custody for a year and the sentence imposed on her – three years ’ imprisonment, suspended for three years – had been disproportionate to any legitimate aim."

According to the Court ’ s well-established case-law, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v.

The arrest and detention of protesters therefore constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression (ibid.). The arrest of students who, during an official ceremony at a university, shouted slogans and raised banners and placards protesting against various practices of the university administration which they considered to be anti ‑ democratic also constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression (see Açık and Others v.

In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This margin of appreciation is not, however, unlimited, but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 33, ECHR 2001 ‑ II, and Krasulya v. Russia, no. 12365/03, § 34, 22 February 2007 )."

The Court reiterates in this connection that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or debates on questions of public interest. It has been the Court ’ s consistent approach to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political debate, for broad restrictions imposed in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the State concerned (see Feldek v.

The protesters, however, failed to comply with the established admission procedure: they bypassed the identity and security checks, did not register at the reception desk and did not wait in a queue for an available official to receive their petition. Instead, they stormed into the building, pushed one of the guards aside, jumped over furniture and eventually locked themselves in a vacant office. Such behaviour, intensified by the number of protesters, could have frightened the employees and visitors present and disrupted the normal functioning of the President ’ s Administration. In such circumstances the actions of the police in arresting the protesters, including the applicant, and removing them from the President ’ s Administration ’ s premises may be considered as justified by the demands of the protection of public order (see, for similar reasoning, Steel and Others, cited above, §§ 103 and 104, and Lucas, cited above)."

Thus, in the case of Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom the Court examined two situations. The first situation concerned a protest against a grouse shoot involving a group of about sixty people attempting to obstruct a hunt. The Court considered that in such circumstances forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order. The second situation concerned a protest against the construction of a motorway. The participants repeatedly broke into a construction site, where they climbed into trees to be felled and onto some of the stationary machinery and placed themselves in front of machinery in order to impede the engineering works. The Court considered that seventeen hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days ’ imprisonment for such disorderly behaviour was compatible with the requirements of Article 10 (see Steel and Others, cited above, §§ 105 – 109)."

Whereas the Court left open the question as to whether that particular conduct could be covered by the guarantees set out in Articles 10 and 11, it found that by imposing a criminal fine on the participants the national authorities had acted within their margin of appreciation (see Drieman and Others, cited above)."

In that case the applicant, the mayor of a town, stated in a speech made during a public assembly his refusal to remove an Albanian flag, in defiance of a decision of the Constitutional Court. That speech triggered a fight between those citizens who wanted to remove the flag and those who wanted to keep it. After that incident, that applicant organised an armed vigil to protect the Albanian flag. The police later found weapons in the town hall and in the applicant ’ s flat. On the same day as they found the cache of weapons, the police were attacked by a group of about 200 people, who were armed with metal sticks and threw stones, rocks, Molotov cocktails and teargas projectiles at them. The Court found that in the very sensitive interethnic situation of that time the applicant ’ s speeches and actions had encouraged interethnic violence and violence against the police. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account that, although the applicant had been sentenced to seven years ’ imprisonment, due to an amnesty he spent only one year and three months in prison. Therefore, even if the original sentence could be considered severe, the term actually spent in prison could not be considered disproportionate, regard being had to the facts of the case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001 )."

Another important principle that transpires from the Court ’ s case- law is that participants in a demonstration which results in damage or other disorder but who do not themselves commit any violent or otherwise reprehensible acts cannot be prosecuted solely on the ground of their participation in the demonstration. Thus, in the case of Ezelin v. France the applicant was sentenced to a reprimand for participating in a demonstration which resulted in public property being damaged by offensive and insulting graffiti, the perpetrators of which were never identified. When finding a violation of Article 11, the Court held that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly was of such importance that a person could not be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration, so long as that person did not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53)."

Thus, in the case of Yılmaz and Kılıç the Court found that four years ’ imprisonment for participating in a demonstration during which slogans calling for violence had been chanted by the crowd was disproportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order and therefore incompatible with Article 10. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account, among other things, that it had been never established whether the applicants had taken part in chanting the violent slogans (see Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, § § 65-69, 17 July 2008 ). Finally, the case of Schwabe and M.G concerned the applicants ’ arrest immediately before the commencement of a demonstration against a G8 summit. A similar demonstration the day before had ended with rioting, involving well-organised violent demonstrators who had attacked the police with stones and baseball bats. The Court noted that it had not been shown that the applicants had had violent intentions in seeking to take part in G8-related demonstrations. In such circumstances, their detention for almost six days in order to prevent them from participating in a demonstration that risked becoming violent had failed to strike a fair balance between the aims of securing public safety and the prevention of crime and the applicants ’ interest in freedom of assembly (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § § 105 and 114- 119)."

The disturbance that followed was not part of their initial plan but a reaction to the guards ’ attempts to stop them from entering the building.

                "56. If associations in Bulgaria could, when registered as such, participate in elections and accede to power, as was the case in Gorzelik and Others (cited above), it might be necessary to require some of them to register as political parties, so as to make them subject to, for instance, stricter rules concerning party financing, public control and transparency (see paragraph 20 above). However, under Bulgarian law, as it stood at the material time and as it stands at present, associations may not participate in national, local or European elections (see paragraph 21 above). There is therefore no “ pressing social need ” to require every association deemed by the courts to pursue “ political ” goals to register as a political party, especially in view of the fact that, as noted above, the exact meaning of that term under Bulgarian law appears to be quite vague. That would mean forcing the association to take a legal shape which its founders did not seek. It would also mean subjecting it to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, such as for instance the rule that a political party cannot be formed by less than fifty enfranchised citizens (see paragraph 19 above), which may in some cases prove an insurmountable obstacle for its founders. Moreover, such an approach runs counter to freedom of association, because, in case it is adopted, the liberty of action which will remain available to the founders of an association may become either non ‑ existent or so reduced as to be of no practical value (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, § 56; Sigurður A.

The Plovdiv Regional Court had not relied on a specific provision of the Political Parties Act of 1990 to justify its refusal to register the association, which was only natural in view of the text of section 1(3) of that Act. That court's proposition that only political parties could pursue political goals showed a fundamental lack of understanding of the role of non-governmental organisations in a democratic society. These were frequently founded in order to promote various causes and influence public policies. Their goals were thus often political. The fundamental difference between them and political parties, however, were not these goals, but the means to achieve them. Political parties participated in elections and in the government, whereas associations did not. They merely influenced public opinion on various issues, thus indirectly shaping the government's policies. Likewise, the Plovdiv Court of Appeals'holding that the association's aims fell under the proscription of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was erroneous. The association's aims, as was apparent from the wording of its articles, consisted of various reform ideas, but did not amount to a concrete and coherent political programme and ideology. There was no reason why such ideas could not be backed by various entities in a pluralistic society. It was important to underscore that the association's articles contained no language pointing to an intention to participate in elections or in the government, which were indeed goals solely characteristic of political parties. On the other hand, Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was not framed with sufficient precision, as it could be read as prohibiting to associations all types of political goals. Nor did it make clear what was exactly prohibited: political goals or also political activities. The interference had also been arbitrary, as evidenced by the lack of genuine reasons for the Supreme Court of Cassation's judgment, whose holding was packed in just four lines."

The association had not engaged in any action which could characterise it as propagating violence or undemocratic principles. The idea of a monarchy and the related insignia were not undemocratic or violent, as evidenced in particular by the fact that the name of the coalition which had ruled the country as between 2001 and 2005 had been “National Movement Simeon II”, after the former heir to the throne Simeon Saxe-Coburggotski, who had become prime minister. Even before his starting into office in 2001 Bulgaria's coat of arms had featured a crown, whereas the public debate over the form of government – republic or monarchy – continued. While the Constitution indeed needed stability, it was by no means carved into stone. Its amendment could be envisaged for the purpose of bringing it in line with the dominant public views on the form of government, whereas suppressing any ideas in this respect could harm democracy and constituted unfettered majority rule."

The ability to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association's aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, pp. 1614 ‑ 15, § 40; The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, § 57; The Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, cited above, § 59; and Ramazanova and Others v.

While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio ‑ economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others, § 92; and The Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, § 61, both cited above )."

Such a link is particularly relevant where – as here – the authorities'stance towards an association was in reaction to its views and statements (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, § 59, citing Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

The applicant argued that these courts had erred in the interpretation and application of these legal provisions. However, the Court notes that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, § 55; and Tsonev, § 45, both cited above). Firstly, it is prepared to accept that their holding that the aims of the association were contrary to the Constitution of 1991 did not go so far as to become arbitrary. Secondly, it is true that their categorization of these aims as “political” within the meaning of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 and their holding that the association could not pursue them without being a political party may appear questionable in view of the construction of this Article by the Constitutional Court and the tenor of the other relevant provisions of domestic law (see paragraphs 17, 19 and 22 above). However, the Court is mindful that legal opinions on the exact purport of such a wide notion open to largely diverse interpretations – “political” – may differ. It is therefore likewise prepared to accept that these holdings were not as patently unreasonable as to become arbitrary. Moreover, while the reasoning of the national courts, and especially that of the Supreme Court of Cassation, was indeed very scant, it was not altogether lacking, as claimed by the applicant."

It is not possible to attain absolute rigidity in the framing of laws, and many of them – especially a national constitution – are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The level of precision required of domestic legislation depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question and the field it is designed to cover (see Maestri, cited above, § 30 in fine ). It must also be borne in mind that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. The mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “foreseeability” for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 65)."

An organisation may campaign for a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the State if the means used to that end are in every respect legal and democratic and if the change proposed is itself compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Yazar and Others v. Turkey, nos. 22723/93, 22724/93 and 22725/93, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.

Bulgaria, no. 59489/00, § 59, 20 October 2005 ). There is no indication that these conditions were not present. Monarchy is not incompatible in itself with the principles of democracy, as shown by the example of a number of member States of the Council of Europe. Nor has it been argued that the Constitution of 1879 was undemocratic. It provided for a parliamentary monarchy, separation of powers, universal suffrage, and enshrined a number of fundamental rights (see paragraph 23 above)."

Firstly, it does not appear that it truly amounted to a request for territorial changes. Secondly, even if it was so, the mere fact that an organisation demands such changes cannot automatically justify interferences with its members'freedoms of association and assembly (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others, cited above, § 61, citing Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 )."

The first thing which needs to be noted in this connection is the uncertainty surrounding the term “political”, as used in Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 and as interpreted by the domestic courts. For instance, in the present case these courts deemed that a campaign for changes in the constitution and the form of government fell within that category. In another recent case these same courts had, more questionably, stated that the “holding of meetings, demonstrations, assemblies and other forms of public campaigning” by an association campaigning for regional autonomy and alleged minority rights also amounted to political goals and activities within the meaning of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991. The Court found this holding unwarranted (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, §§ 17, 19, 21 and 73 ). The Constitutional Court has, for its part, adopted a different definition of “political”, which was centred on “participation in the process of forming the bodies through which ... the people exercise[d] its power ” (see paragraph 22 above ). Against this background and bearing in mind that this term is inherently vague and could be subject to largely diverse interpretations, it is quite conceivable that the Bulgarian courts could label any goals which are in some way related to the normal functioning of a democratic society as “political” and accordingly direct the founders of legal entities wishing to pursue such goals to register them as political parties instead of “ ordinary ” associations. A classification based on this criterion is therefore liable to produce incoherent results and engender considerable uncertainty among those wishing to apply for registration of such entities."

If associations in Bulgaria could, when registered as such, participate in elections and accede to power, as was the case in Gorzelik and Others (cited above), it might be necessary to require some of them to register as political parties, so as to make them subject to, for instance, stricter rules concerning party financing, public control and transparency (see paragraph 20 above). However, under Bulgarian law, as it stood at the material time and as it stands at present, associations may not participate in national, local or European elections (see paragraph 21 above). There is therefore no “ pressing social need ” to require every association deemed by the courts to pursue “ political ” goals to register as a political party, especially in view of the fact that, as noted above, the exact meaning of that term under Bulgarian law appears to be quite vague. That would mean forcing the association to take a legal shape which its founders did not seek. It would also mean subjecting it to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, such as for instance the rule that a political party cannot be formed by less than fifty enfranchised citizens (see paragraph 19 above), which may in some cases prove an insurmountable obstacle for its founders. Moreover, such an approach runs counter to freedom of association, because, in case it is adopted, the liberty of action which will remain available to the founders of an association may become either non ‑ existent or so reduced as to be of no practical value (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, § 56; Sigurður A.

The disciplinary section added that the directives issued by the National Council of the Judiciary on 22 March 1990 and 14 July 1993 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 below), which emphasised – the second one in particular – the substantial conflict between membership of the Freemasons and membership of the judiciary, were to be seen in the context of such developments. The decision also stated that it was contrary to disciplinary rules for a judge to be a Freemason, for the following reasons: the incompatibility between the Masonic and judicial oaths, the hierarchical relationship between Freemasons, the “rejection” of State justice in favour of Masonic “ justice ” and, lastly, the indissoluble nature of the bond between Freemasons, even in the case of a member who wished to leave the organisation.",

                "19. The Constitutional Court, when asked to give a ruling as to whether Article 18 of the 1946 decree was compatible with Article 25 § 2 of the Constitution, held that, in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the principle of lawfulness applied as a fundamental requirement of the rule of law and was a necessary consequence of the role conferred on the judiciary by the Constitution (judgment no. 100 of 8 June 1981, § 4).",
                "However, with regard to the fact that Article 18 did not specify the types of conduct which might be regarded as unlawful, the Constitutional Court pointed out that it was not possible to give examples of every type of conduct which might undermine the values guaranteed by that provision: the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and the prestige of the judiciary. It considered that those values amounted to principles of professional conduct which could not be included in “ guidelines laid down in advance, because it [was] not possible to identify and classify every example of reprehensible conduct which might provoke a negative reaction in society” (ibid., § 5). The Constitutional Court subsequently reiterated that the earlier laws governing the same subject matter had included a provision of general scope alongside the provisions penalising specific conduct, that the proposals for reform in this field had always been worded in general terms and that the same was true for other professional categories. It concluded: “The provisions in this area cannot but be of general scope because specific guidelines would have the effect of legitimising types of conduct which were not expressly mentioned, but which nonetheless attracted society's opprobrium.” It added that those considerations justified the broad scope of the rule and the wide margin of appreciation conferred on a body which, acting within the guarantees inherent in any judicial procedure, was – by virtue of its composition – particularly well qualified to assess whether the conduct considered in each case did or did not undermine the protected values (ibid., § 5).",
                "The Constitutional Court considered, lastly, that such an interpretation was consistent with its case-law on the subject of lawfulness (ibid., § 6). It stated that, as it had previously held, “the principle of lawfulness [was] applicable not only by means of a rigorous and exhaustive description of individual cases, but sometimes also through the use of expressions that are sufficient to determine the rule with certainty and to ascertain whether a particular type of conduct has breached the principle”.",
                "It further held: “'open-ended'provisions which penalise unlawful types of conduct by reference to concepts based on common experience or objectively understandable ethical and social values are fully compatible with the principle of lawfulness. ”",
                "The Constitutional Court added that, with regard to the provisions in issue, such interpretation criteria appeared more valid in a disciplinary context because, in comparison with criminal offences, disciplinary offences aroused less of a reaction in society and had less of an impact on the personal situation of the individual concerned, and also because the possibility of conduct undermining the protected values was greater than in the case of criminal offences.",
                "It further stated that the reference in Article 18 to the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and to the prestige of the judiciary was not objectionable as those concepts could be determined according to general opinion.",
                "Accordingly, the Constitutional Court held that the constitutional provisions in issue had not been infringed, since there had been no breach of the principles of lawfulness and of the independence of the judiciary.",

An introductory note states that the report was compiled by the Committee on Reform of the Judicial System. A copy of the report was sent to the President of Italy and the speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.",

It continued: “ this scrutiny entails ... taking care to ensure that, in discharging their duties, all judges respect – and are seen to respect – the principle of being beholden to the law alone. ”",

The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49; Larissis and Others v.

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000-XI, and N.F. v. Italy, cited above, § 29).",

Article 18 and the first directive adopted by the National Council of the Judiciary in themselves constituted provisions that satisfied the condition of accessibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Autronic AG v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 178, p. 25, § 57)."

As regards foreseeability, the Court must determine whether domestic legislation laid down with sufficient precision the conditions in which a judge should refrain from joining the Freemasons.

                "35. The Court notes, firstly, that Article 18 of the 1946 decree does not define whether and how a judge can exercise his or her freedom of association. Furthermore, while holding that Article 18 was compatible with the Italian Constitution, the Constitutional Court noted that that provision was of general scope (see paragraph 19 above)."

The Court considers that, in the applicant's case, a distinction should be made between two periods: the period from 1981, when he joined the Freemasons, to 22 March 1990, when the National Council of the Judiciary adopted its first directive, and the period between that date and March 1993, when the applicant left the Freemasons. The directive adopted by the National Council of the Judiciary in 1990 stated that a judge's membership of lawful associations which, like the Freemasons, were governed by specific rules of conduct could be problematical for him or her (see paragraph 21 above)."
            ],
            [
                "37. With regard to the first period, the Court considers that Article 18 of the decree on its own did not contain sufficient information to satisfy the condition of foreseeability. The fact that Italy passed a law in 1982 on the right of association – which also ordered the dissolution of the secret P2 lodge (see paragraph 20 above) and prohibited membership of secret associations – could not have enabled the applicant to foresee that a judge's membership of a legal Masonic lodge could give rise to a disciplinary issue."

                "38. With regard to the second period, the Court must determine whether Article 18, combined with the 1990 directive (see paragraph 21 above), supports the proposition that the sanction in question was foreseeable."

Furthermore, the title of the report was clear: “Report on the incompatibility of judicial office with membership of the Freemasons. ”",
                "However, although the title was unambiguous and the directive was primarily concerned with membership of the Freemasons, the debate held on 22 March 1990 before the National Council of the Judiciary sought to formulate, rather than solve, a problem.",
                "That is demonstrated by the fact that the directive was adopted after the major debate in Italy on the unlawfulness of the secret P2 lodge. Furthermore, the directive merely stated: “Naturally, members of the judiciary are prohibited by law from joining the associations proscribed by Law no. 17 of 1982. ” With regard to other associations, the directive contained the following passage: “the [National] Council [of the Judiciary] considers it necessary to suggest to the Minister of Justice that consideration be given to the advisability of proposing restrictions on judges'freedom of association, to include a reference to all associations which – on account of their organisation and ends – entail for their members particularly strong bonds of hierarchy and solidarity” (see paragraph 21 above)."

            [
                "40. Lastly, the Court considers it important to emphasise that the debate of 22 March 1990 did not take place in the context of disciplinary supervision of judges, as was the case for the directive of 14 July 1993, but in the context of their career progression ( see paragraph 22 above). It is therefore clear from an overall examination of the debate that the National Council of the Judiciary was questioning whether it was advisable for a judge to be a Freemason, but there was no indication in the debate that membership of the Freemasons could constitute a disciplinary offence in every case."

                "The Court's assessment is confirmed by the fact that the National Council of the Judiciary itself felt the need to come back to the issue on 14 July 1993 (see paragraph 22 above) and state in clear terms that the exercise of judicial functions was incompatible with membership of the Freemasons."

If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts. The Court has already held that such scrutiny was necessary in a case concerning a Member of Parliament who had been convicted of proffering insults (see the Castells judgment cited above, pp. 22–23, § 42); such scrutiny is all the more necessary where an entire political party is dissolved and its leaders banned from carrying on any similar activity in the future."

It therefore cannot be resolved by oppression, terror and military means. Recourse to violence means that the right to self-determination, which is a natural and inalienable right of all peoples, is not exercised jointly, but separately and unilaterally. The remedy for this problem is political. If the oppression of the Kurdish people and discrimination against them are to end, Turks and Kurds must unite.",

But it could not be accepted that there were two nations within the Republic of Turkey, whose citizens, whatever their ethnic origin, had Turkish nationality. In reality the proposals in the party constitution covering support for non-Turkish languages and cultures were intended to create minorities, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation.",

It considered that national unity was achieved through the integration of communities and individuals who, irrespective of their ethnic origin and on an equal footing, formed the nation and founded the State. In Turkey there were no “minorities” or “national minorities”, other than those referred to in the Treaty of Lausanne and the friendship treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria, and there were no constitutional or legislative provisions allowing distinctions to be made between citizens. Like all nationals of foreign descent, nationals of Kurdish origin could express their identity, but the Constitution and the law precluded them from forming a nation or a minority distinct from the Turkish nation. Consequently, objectives which, like those of the TBKP, encouraged separatism and the division of the Turkish nation were unacceptable and justified dissolving the party concerned."

By choosing to call itself “communist”, the TBKP perforce referred to a subversive doctrine and a totalitarian political goal that undermined Turkey’s political and territorial unity and jeopardised the fundamental principles of its public law, such as secularism. “Communism” invariably presupposed seizing power and aimed to establish a political order that would be unacceptable, not just in Turkey but also in the other member States of the Council of Europe. Further, the use of certain names was also proscribed in other legal systems in the West. In that respect, the Government referred to the German, Polish and Portuguese Constitutions. In any event, whatever the intentions of the TBKP and its leaders in choosing the name “communist” in 1990 (after the fall of the Berlin Wall) may have been, that name could not, in the Government’s view, be considered devoid of political meaning."

By drawing a distinction in its constitution and programme between Turks and Kurds, referring to the Kurds’ “national” identity, requesting constitutional recognition of “the existence of the Kurds”, describing the Kurds as a “nation” and asserting their right to self-determination, the TBKP had opened up a split that would destroy the basis of citizenship, which was independent of ethnic origin. As that was tantamount to challenging the very principles underpinning the State, the Constitutional Court had had to review the constitutionality of that political aim. In so doing, it had followed the line taken by the German Constitutional Court in its judgment of 31 October 1991 on the right of foreign nationals to vote in local elections and by the French Constitutional Council in its decision of 9 May 1991 on the status of Corsica.",

For that reason, where a political party such as the TBKP had called those institutions or principles into question, it could not seek application of the Convention or its Protocols.",
                "At the very least, Article 17 of the Convention should be applied in respect of the TBKP since the party had called into question both the bases of the Convention and the freedoms it secured. In that connection, the Government cited the Commission’s decisions in the cases of Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands (application nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, Decisions and Reports (DR) 18, p. 187); Kühnen v. Germany (application no. 12194/86, DR 56, p. 205); H., W., P. and K. v. Austria (application no. 12774/87, DR 62, p. 216); and Remer v. Germany (application no. 25096/94, DR 82-A, p. 117). In a context of vicious terrorism such as Turkey was experiencing, the need to preclude improper use of the Convention by applying Article 17 was even more obvious, as the Turkish authorities had to prohibit the use of “expressions” and the formation of “associations” that would inevitably incite violence and enmity between the various sections of Turkish society."

On the contrary, if Article 11 was considered to be a legal safeguard that ensured the proper functioning of democracy, political parties were one of the most important forms of association it protected. In that connection, the Commission referred to a number of decisions in which it had examined, under Article 11, various restrictions on the activities of political parties and even the dissolution of such parties, thereby implicitly accepting that Article 11 applied to that type of association (see the German Communist Party case, application no. 250/57, Yearbook 1, p. 222; the Greek case, Yearbook 12, p. 170, § 392; the France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands v.

In such cases the aim of the offending actions of the applicants concerned had been to spread violence (see the German Communist Party case cited above) or hatred (see the Remer case cited above). Conversely, there was nothing in the TBKP ’s constitution or programme to suggest that it was not a democratic party, or that it resorted to illegal or undemocratic methods, encouraged the use of violence, aimed to undermine Turkey’s democratic and pluralist political system or pursued objectives that were racist or likely to destroy the rights and freedoms of others."

It notes that although Article 11 refers to “freedom of association with others, including the right to form … trade unions …”, the conjunction “including” clearly shows that trade unions are but one example among others of the form in which the right to freedom of association may be exercised. It is therefore not possible to conclude, as the Government did, that by referring to trade unions – for reasons related mainly to issues that were current at the time – those who drafted the Convention intended to exclude political parties from the scope of Article 11."

As the Court has said in the past, while it is in principle open to the national authorities to take such action as they consider necessary to respect the rule of law or to give effect to constitutional rights, they must do so in a manner which is compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v.

Through its system of collective enforcement of the rights it establishes (see the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 23 March 1995 ( preliminary objections ), Series A no. 310, p. 26, § 70), the Convention reinforces, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the protection afforded at national level, but never limits it (Article 60 of the Convention)."

It makes no distinction as to the type of rule or measure concerned and does not exclude any part of the member States’ “jurisdiction” from scrutiny under the Convention.

Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 28, § 59). For there to be a compromise of that sort any intervention by the authorities must be in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11, which the Court considers below (see paragraphs 37 et seq.).

The right guaranteed by Article 11 would be largely theoretical and illusory if it were limited to the founding of an association, since the national authorities could immediately disband the association without having to comply with the Convention.

It is for that reason that freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 is applicable, subject to paragraph 2, not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb (see, among many other authorities, the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 25, § 52).

Austria judgment the Court described the State as the ultimate guarantor of the principle of pluralism (see the judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276, p. 16, § 38). In the political sphere that responsibility means that the State is under the obligation, among others, to hold, in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. Such expression is inconceivable without the participation of a plurality of political parties representing the different shades of opinion to be found within a country’s population. By relaying this range of opinion, not only within political institutions but also – with the help of the media – at all levels of social life, political parties make an irreplaceable contribution to political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 42, and the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, § 43)."

                "That is apparent, firstly, from the Preamble to the Convention, which establishes a very clear connection between the Convention and democracy by stating that the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are best ensured on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understanding and observance of human rights (see the Klass and Others judgment cited above, p. 28, § 59). The Preamble goes on to affirm that European countries have a common heritage of political tradition, ideals, freedom and the rule of law. The Court has observed that in that common heritage are to be found the underlying values of the Convention (see the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 35, § 88); it has pointed out several times that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23, p. 27, § 53, and the Soering judgment cited above, p. 34, § 87).",
                "In addition, Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention require that interference with the exercise of the rights they enshrine must be assessed by the yardstick of what is “necessary in a democratic society”. The only type of necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of those rights is, therefore, one which may claim to spring from “democratic society”. Democracy thus appears to be the only political model contemplated by the Convention and, accordingly, the only one compatible with it.",
                "The Court has identified certain provisions of the Convention as being characteristic of democratic society. Thus in its very first judgment it held that in a “democratic society within the meaning of the Preamble and the other clauses of the Convention”, proceedings before the judiciary should be conducted in the presence of the parties and in public and that that fundamental principle was upheld in Article 6 of the Convention (see the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 14 November 1960 ( preliminary objections and questions of procedure ), Series A no. 1, p. 13). In a field closer to the one concerned in the instant case, the Court has on many occasions stated, for example, that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment (see, among other authorities, the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 25, § 52), whereas in the Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt judgment cited above it noted the prime importance of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which enshrines a characteristic principle of an effective political democracy (p. 22, § 47)."

Consequently, the exceptions set out in Article 11 are, where political parties are concerned, to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on such parties’ freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts. The Court has already held that such scrutiny was necessary in a case concerning a Member of Parliament who had been convicted of proffering insults (see the Castells judgment cited above, pp. 22–23, § 42); such scrutiny is all the more necessary where an entire political party is dissolved and its leaders banned from carrying on any similar activity in the future."

This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 31).",

In their submission, there was a contradiction in penalising a political party in July 1991 for calling itself “communist” when, on the one hand, it had not been an offence since April 1991 to carry on activities inspired by communist ideology and, on the other, the Constitutional Court had itself accepted that the TBKP was not seeking the domination of one social class over the others and that its constitution and programme were in accordance with democratic principles.",
                "As to the separatist activities attributed to the TBKP by the Government, the applicants affirmed that there was no basis for such an allegation either in the party’s documents or in the statements of its members. On the contrary, the party’s constitution was very clear on that point when it stated that the Kurdish problem required a fair, democratic and peaceful solution and the voluntary co-existence of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples within Turkish territory on the basis of equal rights. The TBKP was therefore not opposed to the territorial integrity of the country and had never advocated separatism. Further, the party’s leaders had not been prosecuted under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, which made it a capital offence actively to support separatism. The fact remained, however, that the authorities considered the mere use of the word “Kurd” to be discriminatory, even though the problem was such that any political party wishing to resolve it could not avoid mentioning it. The problem existed and minority groups existed, but political parties could not refer to them.",
                "Lastly, with regard to the allegation that the TBKP was a terrorist association, the applicants pointed out that it had been dissolved only ten days after it was formed so that it had had no time for any activity whatsoever. The TBKP ’s future activities could therefore only have been a matter for speculation and could not have formed the basis for a decision to dissolve the party."

The Government pointed out that freedom of association – like freedom of expression – was not absolute and often conflicted with other paramount interests in a democratic society. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation had to be gauged in the light of the legitimate aim pursued by the interference and the background to the facts of the case. In that regard, the Government referred to the Wingrove v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 November 1996 ( Reports 1996-V), in which the Court had, when assessing the facts, taken into account the needs arising from their historical context.",
                "If the TBKP ’s constitution and programme were analysed in a similar way, a pressing need to impose the impugned restriction in circumstances in which territorial integrity and national security were threatened would be found not just in the case of Turkey, but also in that of each of the Council of Europe’s member States. What was at stake was the essential conditions for a State’s existence in the international order, conditions which were even guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations.",
                "Further, it was apparent from the case-law that where the interference pursued as a legitimate aim the protection of public order, territorial integrity, the public interest or democracy, the Convention institutions did not require that the risk of violence justifying the interference should be real, current or imminent. As authority for that proposition, the Government cited the decisions in which the Commission had declared inadmissible the cases of X v. Austria (application no. 5321/71, Collection of Decisions 42, p. 105), T. v. Belgium (application no. 9777/82, DR 34, p. 158) and Association A. and H. v. Austria (application no. 9905/82, DR 36, p. 187). In addition, the Commission had accepted in two German cases that restrictions on freedom of expression could be justified by national-security considerations without its being necessary to determine whether the exercise of freedom of expression had had any practical implications (see the Kuck v. Germany case, application no. 29742/96, and the Fleischle v. Germany case, application no. 29744/96). Lastly, in the Purcell and Others v. Ireland case, the Commission had taken into account the terrorist threat and the public interest in countering it (application no. 15404/89, DR 70, p. 262).",
                "In all those cases the actual content of the expressions concerned had sufficed to warrant the conclusion that restrictions had to be imposed on their use, without its being necessary to determine whether there was a current risk of violence or a causal link with an act of violence directly provoked by the use of the expression. On the other hand, in the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976 (Series A no. 24), the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979 (Series A no. 30), and the Lingens and Castells judgments cited above, in all of which the Court had held that there had been a violation of Article 10, the publications concerned had not called into question the very existence of the State and the democratic order.",

At the hearing before the Court the Delegate of the Commission, in a preliminary observation, stressed the difference between implementing an illegal programme and implementing one in which all that was sought was a change in the law. While that distinction could sometimes be difficult to draw in practice, associations, including political parties, should be able to campaign for a change in the law or the legal and constitutional structures of the State, provided of course that the means used for the purpose were in all respects lawful and democratic and that the proposed change was itself compatible with fundamental democratic principles.",

Moreover, those passages did not contain any incitement to violence but, on the contrary, showed the TBKP ’s desire to achieve its objectives – even those in regard to the position of the population of Kurdish origin – by democratic means and in accordance with Turkish laws and institutions."

Admittedly, reference is made to the right to self-determination of the “Kurdish nation” and its right to “secede”; however, read in their context, the statements using these words do not encourage secession from Turkey but seek rather to stress that the proposed federal system could not come about without the Kurds' freely given consent, which should be expressed through a referendum.",

The current status quo has failed with respect to the Kurdish problem and its deafening collapse can be heard from here... What is the only possible solution? ... This issue can only be resolved by respecting the wish of the Kurdish people ... the real remedy lies with the Kurdish people. We will ask the Kurds: 'What do you want?' ... if, conversely, they seek secession, we will respect their wish. We will organise a referendum. We will ask the Kurdish people ..., everyone, from Hakkari to Antep: 'Do you want to create a separate State in our land or not?' The Socialist Party prefers unification... Who is inciting secession? Oppression [is]. The oppression of the Kurdish people by the Turkish State. We will defend unification by putting an end to that oppression and that will be proof of [our] acceptance of the Kurdish people's will... The Socialist Party will defend the union of the two peoples within the federation and the joint [exercise] of power... The Socialist Party is the last bridge between the Kurdish and Turkish people... No party other than the Socialist Party has shared the Kurds' destiny, taken up a position against the Turkish State or is able to maintain that position.”",

If the problem is seen as a Kurdish one, you will resolve it by democracy and freedom. In fact, it is the present regime that has transformed the Euphrates into a border... It was an economic border... Then, they made the Euphrates a political border ... and, lastly, an ideological one... Turkish nationalism has drowned in the Euphrates; it cannot cross it ... because nationalism has no place in these lands... There is a Turkish problem but also a Kurdish problem ... a fraternal solution will come from the Socialist Party. The [other] five parties have become separatist ... because they were nationalist. We offer a fraternal solution, a federation. The Kurdish nation should be given the right to self-determination. That is how the right conditions for unification will come about...

The Constitutional Court acceded to the latter request only and heard the party Chairman, Mr Perinçek, on 12 May, who had ceased to be Chairman of the party a short time before.",
                "Before the Constitutional Court the SP's representatives firstly contested the constitutionality of certain provisions of Law no. 2820 on which Principal State Counsel relied. They also argued that the court should not admit the SP's publications (see paragraph 13 above) in evidence against that party. They said that two of the publications were copies of a speech made by Mr Perinçek before his election as party Chairman on 6 July 1991; furthermore, they had been examined by the National Security Courts and found not to contravene the law (see paragraph 11 above).",

They maintained that the court would be contradicting itself if it now decided to dissolve the SP purely because of Mr Perinçek's oral statements, which, in the case before the court, were merely reiterations of paragraph 31 of the programme, which had already been reviewed by the Constitutional Court. They noted, lastly, that since the enactment of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) which had, in particular, repealed Article 142 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below), it was no longer illegal to carry on Marxist-Leninist activities; in their submission, if one political party was treated differently from the others, the aim pursued by the Turkish legislature would be defeated."

The order was published in the Official Gazette on 25 October 1992. As a consequence, the founders and managers of the party were banned from holding similar office in any other political body (former Article 69 of the Constitution – see paragraph 16 below).",

Those publications and statements accordingly also bound the SP and consequently were admissible as relevant evidence under section 101 of Law no. 2820.",

Moreover, it could not accept that the fact that a provision of the Criminal Code making it an offence to behave in a certain way had been repealed meant that similar conduct no longer constituted a valid ground for dissolution under Law no. 2820.",

It no longer had to be determined whether the programme and constitution of the SP were in conformity with the law, but solely whether its political activities were caught by the relevant prohibitions.",
                "In reaching its decision on the merits, the Constitutional Court noted, inter alia, that the SP referred in its political message to two nations: the Kurdish nation and the Turkish nation. But it could not be accepted that there were two nations within the Republic of Turkey, whose citizens, whatever their ethnic origin, had Turkish nationality. In reality, the statements made by the SP concerning Kurdish national and cultural rights were intended to create minorities and, ultimately, the establishment of a Kurdish-Turkish federation, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the Turkish State.",

As that amounted to challenging the very basis of the State, the Constitutional Court had had to review the constitutionality of that political aim. In so doing, it had followed the line taken by the German Constitutional Court in its judgment of 31 October 1991 on the right of foreign nationals to vote in local elections and by the French Constitutional Council in its decision of 9 May 1991 on the status of Corsica.",

For that reason, where a political party such as the SP had called those institutions or principles into question, it could not seek application of the Convention or its Protocols, since it was not the SP's freedom of association that was in issue in the present case, but the right to self-determination, which did not come within the compass of the Convention.",

In so doing, the SP had said the same things as the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (“the PKK”), without distancing itself from any of the latter's methods. Moreover, the Constitutional Court had, in its judgment ordering the dissolution of the SP, recognised that Article 17 was relevant in the case of the SP and concluded that the party's activities were covered by that provision."

On the contrary, if Article 11 was considered to be a legal safeguard that ensured the proper functioning of democracy, political parties were one of the most important forms of association it protected. In that connection, the Commission referred to a number of decisions in which it had examined, under Article 11, various restrictions on the activities of political parties and even the dissolution of such parties, thereby implicitly accepting that Article 11 applied to that type of association (see the German Communist Party case, application no. 250/57, Yearbook 1, p. 225; the Greek case, Yearbook 12, p. 170, § 392; the France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands v.

Against that background, the declarations of a well-known political leader were bound to aggravate the violence and hatred. In such cases, the authority to the effect that freedom of expression also applied to statements that offended, shocked or disturbed bore no relevance.

By holding meetings with thousands of people in the towns and provinces, the Kurd had proved himself and broken down the barriers of fear.” Furthermore, by calling on those present to “sow courage, rather than watermelons”, Mr Perinçek had, in the Government's submission, “exhorted them to stop all activities other than the destruction of order”.

                "61. Concerning the second condition, the Court considers that even if it may be assumed that the political project advocated by the applicant party was indeed the autonomy or even secession of Pirin Macedonia, this does not automatically mean that it was at variance with the principles of democracy. In a previous case which concerned bans of meetings organised by UMO Ilinden, which organisation is apparently closely connected with the applicant party, the Court examined the question whether the probable expression of separatist ideas at public meetings constituted sufficient grounds for the banning of such meetings, and held that “ that the fact that a group of persons calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country ’ s territory – thus demanding fundamental constitutional and territorial changes – cannot automatically justify a prohibition of its assemblies ” (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97). It also held that “ the probability that separatist declarations would be made at meetings organised by [UMO] Ilinden could not justify a ban on [its] meetings ” (ibid., § 98). In that case the Court had regard, inter alia, to the Constitutional Court ’ s findings which are at issue in the present case ( ibid., § 9 6 ). The Court considers that the reasoning adopted in Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden applies in the case at hand as well. The mere fact that a political party calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country ’ s territory is not a sufficient basis to justify its dissolution on national security grounds. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order without putting into question the tenets of democracy, and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through, inter alia, participation in the political process. However shocking and unacceptable the statements of the applicant party ’ s leaders and members may appear to the authorities or the majority of the population and however illegitimate their demands may be, they do not appear to warrant the impugned interference. The fact that the applicant party ’ s political programme was considered incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Bulgarian State does not make it incompatible with the rules and principles of democracy. It is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others, p. 1257, § 47, and Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP), § 41, both cited above). Moreover, there is no indication that the applicant party had any real chance of bringing about political changes which would not meet with the approval of everyone on the political stage (see Yazar and Others, cited above, § 58 in fine ). Indeed, it was recognised in the request for its dissolution that its public influence was negligible (see paragraph 15 above). In this connection, it should also be noted that some of UMO Ilinden ’ s and the applicant party ’ s declarations apparently included an element of exaggeration and provocativeness as they sought to attract attention (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 102 in fine ). It thus appears that the Constitutional Court ’ s holding that the applicant party ’ s activity truly “ imperil [ed] [ Bulgaria ’ s] national security ” was not based an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

They argued that the party had in fact been formed in 1990 and was a successor of the “illegal” UMO Ilinden. They further argued that the party ’ s ultimate aim was the formation of an independent Macedonian state through the secession of Pirin Macedonia from Bulgaria. The party ’ s members and leaders had on numerous occasions declared such goals. The party ’ s original constitution, amended in the course of the proceedings before the Sofia City Court, contained language to the effect that it would “protect the interests of the population of Pirin Macedonia [and] of the refugees from Aegean and Vardar Macedonia ”. This indicated its separatist character. Also, the applicant party ’ s chairman, Mr Ivan Singartiyski (the second applicant), had sent letters to the state institutions and media of a neighbouring country, urging them to look for a “Macedonian minority” in Bulgaria.

It was not sufficient to make the assessment solely on the basis of the statements contained in its constitution and programme. The constitution of a party could be just a façade for facilitating its registration; this is why it was necessary to have regard to the party ’ s real activities. It could not be ruled out that the documents could conceal objectives, intentions and activities that were different from those which were publicly proclaimed. It was therefore necessary to compare their content with the party ’ s practical actions.

It had a predecessor and was continuing its activities. The court described the founding of UMO Ilinden in 1990 and its unsuccessful attempt to register in 1990 ‑ 91 (see paragraph 10 above). It further found that UMO Ilinden had split in 1994, the radicals remaining on one side and the more moderate members forming two separate organisations: UMO Ilinden – Democratic Action and UMO Ilinden – Blagoevgrad. Most of the applicant party ’ s current leaders, including Mr Ivan Singartiyski ( the second applicant ) and Mr Kiril Ivanov, had been members of these two organisations, which had merged and, after an unsuccessful attempt to register as an association at the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, had managed to register as a political party at the Sofia City Court. It could thus be concluded that the applicant party was not a novel organisation, but was closely connected with the former unregistered association UMO Ilinden. The two had almost the same name and the same persons were their leaders and members. Moreover, the second applicant and another leader of the applicant party had intimated in newspaper interviews that they considered the applicant party and UMO Ilinden as one and the same organisation. The court therefore concluded that the activities of the applicant party ’ s predecessor organisations should be taken into account for purpose of assessing its constitutionality."

A brochure announcing the event had featured a map of Macedonia, which had included territories that are part of Bulgaria (the Pirin region) and Greece, and in the middle of the map there had been depicted the sixteen ‑ ray Macedonian star symbol [1].",
                "– In 1994 the newspaper Skornuvane, published by UMO Ilinden, had printed a map of Macedonia featuring territories belonging to Bulgaria and Greece.",
                "– On 2 August 1997 the faction of UMO Ilinden lead by Mr Kiril Ivanov had issued a memorandum according to which in Bulgaria there existed “modern-day genocide, discrimination and assimilation” and the Macedonians there were deprived of the right to honour the memory of the thousands of fighters who had fallen in the struggle for “free and independent Macedonia ”. That memorandum had been circulated abroad.",
                "– Immediately after the applicant party ’ s founding, the newspaper New Macedonia in its issue of 21 ‑ 22 March 1998 had reprinted an interview of Mr Ivan Gargavelov, the party ’ s secretary, in which he had allegedly insulted the Bulgarian nation and had attacked representatives of the Bulgarian authorities. He had portrayed the Pirin region as part of Macedonia and had indicated that the unique folklore, culture, traditions and individuality of the Macedonian people had been destroyed, that its history and customs had been stolen, and that its national identity had been denied.",
                "– In February 1999 Mr Ivan Gargavelov had attended a press conference of the Conservative Party held in Skopje, as a representative of UMO Ilinden. When asked why he spoke Bulgarian, he had replied: “This is not Bulgarian, but Macedonian, and this is the language spoken in Bulgaria, whereas the Bulgarians there speak Tatar language ”.",

In this declaration the Pirin region had been referred to as “part of Macedonia ”. The organisation had proclaimed that it was a defender of “the Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia and Bulgaria ”, that is, a distinction had been drawn between Pirin Macedonia and Bulgaria.",

It had been indicated in them that “ Bulgaria even [then] continue[d] to misappropriate Macedonia ’ s cultural heritage” and that “ Bulgaria [had] incited Macedonia ’ s partition”.",

Point five of the declaration had requested an affirmation to the effect that part of the Macedonian people lived on Macedonian territory given in temporary trusteeship to Albania, Bulgaria and Greece by the 1913 treaty of Bucharest [2]. It had been once again proclaimed that this part of Bulgaria ’ s territory was only temporarily under Bulgarian administration.",
                "– On 8 October 1999 Mr Atanas Manushkin, running for mayor of Razlog on the applicant party ’ s ticket, had declared at a press conference: “In several statements made by members of the Bulgarian Government it was said that if the [ United Democratic Forces [3] ] do not win the elections in Razlog, no funding will be forthcoming to the region. Thus, if we win, the government gives us the right to freely choose and declare that this is a free territory, which may decide subsequently where to turn to.”",

He had gone on to say that the prime minister should be presented with the following statement: “We have certain demands, or else we will secede Macedonia ”.",

In it he had expressed the wish that “Pirin Macedonia gain cultural, political and economic autonomy”. He had also stated that “the human rights of the Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia [stood] higher than Bulgaria ’ s national sovereignty”.

Its culmination is the threat to secede the Pirin region if the party ’ s demands are not met. Such a threat, when made by the chairperson of a party, could not only be in words.

The Court ’ s case ‑ law under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention indicated that the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in choosing the means to restrict this right. The State ’ s interference would be in line with the Convention only if the means employed were proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved, namely the protection of a social value of the highest calibre. An interference with the rights protected by the Convention could not be based on conjectures and formal reasons; in deciding to ban a political party or movement the authorities had to have regard mainly to their activity and their compliance with the principles of democracy. The Constitutional Court had held, quite in line with these principles, that the constitutionality of a party should be assessed on the basis of its activities, not solely its constitution and programme."

The facts of the case indicated that the applicant party ’ s beginnings could be traced back to 1990, when UMO Ilinden had been founded. Therefore, the Constitutional Court ’ s finding that the applicant party was not a novel organisation and had a predecessor, UMO Ilinden, was logical. UMO Ilinden ’ s split ‑ up in 1994 had produced two organisations: UMO Ilinden – Democratic Action, headed by Mr Ivan Singartiyski (the second applicant), and UMO Ilinden, headed by Mr Kiril Ivanov, both leaders of the applicant party. In 1998 the two organizations had decided to merge and had applied for registration to the Sofia City Court. The Constitutional Court was right in taking into account the entire period of ten years preceding the applicant party ’ s dissolution for assessing its constitutionality. It was beyond doubt that declaring a party unconstitutional solely on the basis of its leaders ’ statements would be wrong. However, in the instant case the conclusion that the applicant party was unconstitutional was made on the basis of evidence about a long series of incidents outlined by the Constitutional Court in its judgment. The applicant party ’ s activities could be described as promoting separatist ideas, calls for autonomy of the Pirin region, dissemination of maps depicting Bulgarian territory included in the envisaged territory of Macedonia, describing the Pirin region as part of Macedonia, making open invectives and grave allegations against the Bulgarian State, making threats of seceding the Pirin region if the party ’ s demands were not fulfilled, etc."

This threat was much graver than that stemming from the holding of a meeting. In the light of all the evidence, the Constitutional Court ’ s findings that the applicant party treated the Pirin region as non ‑ Bulgarian land and that its activity was going as far as attempting the secession of this territory from Bulgaria were fully warranted."

The main thrust of the applicants ’ argument was that the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment was inconsistent with its own case ‑ law on the permissibility of restrictions of freedom of speech. In particular, it was submitted that in its interpretative judgment no. 7 of 1996 (see paragraph 30 above) the Constitutional Court had held that restrictions of freedom of speech – which, in the applicants ’ view, applied mutatis mutandis to freedom of association – would only be justified if the speech at issue posed an immediate threat of violent overturning of the constitutional order and democracy, whereas in the case at hand it applied a less exacting standard (see paragraph 32 above)."

It also held that “[t] here [was] no doubt that an activity aimed against the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bulgaria imperil [ed] its national security ” (see paragraph 27 above). It is thus apparent that the Constitutional Court was of the view that the applicant party ’ s activities presented a real and tangible danger for the territorial integrity of the country (which is part of the constitutional order of Bulgaria – see Article 2 of the Constitution at paragraph 29 above ), even in the absence of any practical results. In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment was at such variance with its prior case ‑ law as to become arbitrary and hence make the interference not “prescribed by law”. Whether the Constitutional Court ’ s view was warranted and whether its conclusion that the applicant party presented a real and tangible danger was based on an acceptable assessment of the facts are issues to be decided in the context of the question whether or not the interference with the applicants ’ freedom of association was necessary in a democratic society."

It also notes that the interference at issue in the present case was radical: the applicant party was dissolved with immediate effect. Such a drastic measure requires very serious reasons by way of justification before it could be considered proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued; it would be warranted only in the most serious cases (see Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP), § 45, and Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others, § 100, both cited above )."

However, that court did not find that any of the party ’ s leaders or members had made any calls for the use of violence or for the rejection of democratic principles.

However, it reiterates that a political party may campaign for a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the State on two conditions: firstly, the means used to that end must in every respect be legal and democratic, and secondly, the change proposed must itself be compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Yazar and Others, § 49, and Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others, § 98, both cited above).

There is, furthermore, no indication in the case file that any practical actions were undertaken by the applicant party which could pose a threat to Bulgaria ’ s national security. In this connection, the Court observes that the incidents referred to by the Constitutional Court were rallies, speeches, press conferences, letters or maps, in which members of the applicant party or of its predecessor organisations had stated that there existed a Macedonian minority in Bulgaria and that the Pirin region was not part of Bulgaria, and had made certain peaceful demands in that respect (see paragraph 26 above)."
            ],
            [
                "61. Concerning the second condition, the Court considers that even if it may be assumed that the political project advocated by the applicant party was indeed the autonomy or even secession of Pirin Macedonia, this does not automatically mean that it was at variance with the principles of democracy. In a previous case which concerned bans of meetings organised by UMO Ilinden, which organisation is apparently closely connected with the applicant party, the Court examined the question whether the probable expression of separatist ideas at public meetings constituted sufficient grounds for the banning of such meetings, and held that “ that the fact that a group of persons calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country ’ s territory – thus demanding fundamental constitutional and territorial changes – cannot automatically justify a prohibition of its assemblies ” (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97). It also held that “ the probability that separatist declarations would be made at meetings organised by [UMO] Ilinden could not justify a ban on [its] meetings ” (ibid., § 98). In that case the Court had regard, inter alia, to the Constitutional Court ’ s findings which are at issue in the present case ( ibid., § 9 6 ). The Court considers that the reasoning adopted in Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden applies in the case at hand as well. The mere fact that a political party calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country ’ s territory is not a sufficient basis to justify its dissolution on national security grounds. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order without putting into question the tenets of democracy, and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through, inter alia, participation in the political process. However shocking and unacceptable the statements of the applicant party ’ s leaders and members may appear to the authorities or the majority of the population and however illegitimate their demands may be, they do not appear to warrant the impugned interference. The fact that the applicant party ’ s political programme was considered incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Bulgarian State does not make it incompatible with the rules and principles of democracy. It is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others, p. 1257, § 47, and Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP), § 41, both cited above). Moreover, there is no indication that the applicant party had any real chance of bringing about political changes which would not meet with the approval of everyone on the political stage (see Yazar and Others, cited above, § 58 in fine ). Indeed, it was recognised in the request for its dissolution that its public influence was negligible (see paragraph 15 above). In this connection, it should also be noted that some of UMO Ilinden ’ s and the applicant party ’ s declarations apparently included an element of exaggeration and provocativeness as they sought to attract attention (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 102 in fine ). It thus appears that the Constitutional Court ’ s holding that the applicant party ’ s activity truly “ imperil [ed] [ Bulgaria ’ s] national security ” was not based an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

The applicant party informed the Constitutional Court that in view of the sheer volume of documents circulating in the party, the originals of some invoices had been lost and submitted other documents as proof of payment.

Moreover, the applicant party had not submitted any other tangible evidence to demonstrate the professional nature of those expenses. In this connection, the Constitutional Court refused to accept that the food expenses of the driver assigned to the party leader and of other drivers working for the party could be lawfully met by the applicant party, in spite of the latter’s explanation that the relevant expenses had been incurred while the drivers were on duty."

Reimbursement of food and commuting expenses of persons not on the applicant party’s payroll and not party to the collective labour agreement between the applicant party and its salaried employees, such as freelance consultants, was not considered to be in keeping with the “party’s objectives”. Similarly, meals offered to persons who provided various services to the applicant party, but who were legally employed by other public or private bodies, such as police officers, municipality employees, journalists or gardeners, could not qualify as legitimate expenses under the Political Parties Act because any meal costs had to be met by the relevant person’s respective employers and not by the applicant party. Some dinners hosted for the applicant party’s guests, volunteers or personnel for special occasions were also considered to constitute personal expenditure not related to the party’s legal personality, whereas some other dinners were accepted as relevant to party work. In this connection, the Constitutional Court found that the expenses borne for the meals hosted for the Alevi-Bektaşi Federation and the Pir Sultan Abdal Association, as well as the meals organised for party personnel on the occasion of Bayram [3] and following the death of an employee’s father, should not have been paid from the party’s budget, whereas it deemed legitimate the expenses in relation to food offered to Tekel [4] workers during their industrial action."

In addition, reimbursement of passport fees to various employees was not considered relevant to the party’s objectives, even when the passports had been obtained for travel in connection with party business, as passports could be used for personal travel as well.

Although the applicant party stated that the legal proceedings in question had concerned the party’s political activities, and not personal disputes, the Constitutional Court nevertheless decided that the litigation expenses had to be met by the persons in question, regardless of their role or status in the party, as the political party itself was not a party to any of the relevant proceedings. In the decision of 11 July 2012 concerning the review of the 2009 accounts (see paragraph 10 above), one of the judges dissented from the majority’s approach to this matter, and argued that demanding that such costs be met by the individual members of the party involved directly in the litigation, regardless of the effects of that litigation on the political party, would unduly curtail the scope of the party’s political activities in an unconstitutional manner."

The Constitutional Court found that while the applicant party could lawfully pay for the live broadcast of the relevant events, additional payments to cover the costs of production and for the allocation of link bandwidth were unacceptable, as such costs had to be met by Halk TV itself. In addition, payments made in 2009 for the lease of vehicles for broadcasting rallies organised by the party in various provinces were considered unlawful unless accompanied by the relevant lease agreements and detailed information on the exact nature of the services acquired.

Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes the applicant party’s allegations, which were not disputed by the Government, regarding the impact of the financial sanctions imposed by the Constitutional Court on its political activities, particularly as regards its local branches, women’s and youth branches and training programmes. It appears that the sanctions in question have had a considerable impact on the applicant party’s activities, but it stresses that the full impact of these sanctions cannot be taken into account, having regard to the finding of inadmissibility in respect of the sanctions concerning the 2007 accounts (see paragraph 61 above). It nevertheless notes that the sanctions pertaining to the 2008 and 2009 accounts alone involved a total amount of TRY 2,735,208 (approximately EUR 1,154,840). That amount more than accounts for the cuts suffered by the local branches in 2013, which had increased significance in view of the upcoming local elections in March 2014. Contrary to the Government’s allegations, the Court does not consider that amount to be negligible. Accordingly, it finds that the sanctions in question constituted an interference with the applicant party’s political activities and thus its freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention. The fact that part of the applicant party’s annual income is made up of State funding (see the table in paragraph 13 above) does not change the Court’s finding in this regard, because the provision of financial support to political parties does not give States carte blanche to interfere in their political and/or financial affairs. The Court notes in any event that, contrary to the Government’s allegations, State funding for the years 2008 and 2009 made up only about one-third of the applicant party’s total income.",

Moreover, section 74(1) of the Political Parties Act, which entrusted the Constitutional Court with the duty of inspecting the “lawfulness” of the finances of political parties, was also framed in imprecise terms, thereby leaving that court at liberty to adopt an overly formalistic and restrictive interpretation of the vague requirements of the Act.

While the applicant party had not been allowed to benefit from those amendments, some of the changes introduced corresponded to the grievances it had subsequently raised before the Court. In particular, amendments made to subsection (1) of section 74 (see paragraph 45 above) were proof that until that time, supervision of political parties’ finances by the Constitutional Court had been applied in a manner that unduly restricted their activities and scrutinised their appropriateness. The amendments in question had therefore brought much needed precision to the Act as regards the inspection of political parties’ expenses."

As for warnings, the applicant party maintained that there were likewise no criteria to clarify the circumstances in which warnings could be issued and that it was at the discretion of the Constitutional Court to issue warnings as it saw fit. The applicant party contended that similar circumstances sometimes entailed the more serious sanction of confiscation of assets, while at other times they attracted warnings; as such, it was not possible to foresee when a warning would be issued."

The applicant party stressed that while the Government had argued that the amounts confiscated were relatively low in comparison with the party’s income, that consideration had no relevance to the “test of proportionality” set by the Court. The adverse consequences of the impugned sanctions imposed on the party had already been brought to the Court’s attention (see paragraph 66 above). Those consequences had been brought about by the Constitutional Court’s subjective and restrictive interpretation of the legal requirements on expenditure and the formalities regarding the provision of supporting documentation, and did not as such concern any abuse, corruption or other financial crime on the part of the party. In view of the nature of the irregularities in question, including those concerning documentation, it would have been more proportionate to issue warnings or give prior notice for rectification, but the relevant Act did not provide for such a possibility.

The applicant party nevertheless claimed that the provisions in question did not satisfy the “lawfulness” requirement under Article 11 § 2 of the Convention because, firstly, they did not enable a political party to foresee the types of expenses that would be considered unlawful by the Constitutional Court as falling outside the scope of its “objectives”, and secondly, they lacked clarity as to the sanctions that would be applied in the event of a finding of unlawfulness."

Before embarking on its examination, the Court would stress that while the important purpose served by the financial inspection of political parties is undeniable, such inspection should never be used as a political tool to exercise control over political parties, especially on the pretext that the party is publicly financed. In order to prevent the abuse of the financial inspection mechanism for political purposes, a high standard of “foreseeability” must be applied with regard to laws that govern the inspection of the finances of political parties, in terms of both the specific requirements imposed and the sanctions that a breach of those requirements entails. The importance of the autonomy of political parties in democratic societies and of the need for narrowly tailored legislation to curb State regulation of parties has also been highlighted in the guidelines of the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission (see paragraphs 54-56 above).

The Court notes at the outset that the applicant party’s complaints under this head pertained to the former situation.

The Government indeed confirmed that while a list of unlawful sources of income was provided in section 61 of the Political Parties Act, no such list was provided for unlawful expenses. The Court similarly notes that prior to the amendments in question, there was no provision in the Political Parties Act or elsewhere specifying the nature and scope of the inspection to be carried out by the Constitutional Court. The Court therefore finds prima facie that the relevant domestic law did, technically, suffer from a lack of precision in those respects."

The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain. Therefore, the mere fact that a legal provision can be interpreted in more than one way does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “foreseeability” for the purposes of the Convention (see, among others, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 57, and Zhechev v.

France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A). The Court must therefore determine whether the Constitutional Court had indeed developed consistent, clear and precise case-law at the material time, as alleged by the Government, that would have allowed the applicant party to foresee how the otherwise ambiguous requirements of the Constitution and the Political Parties Act on political party expenditure would be interpreted and enforced in practice and to regulate its conduct accordingly (see, mutatis mutandis, Association Ekin v.

The Court notes by way of example that while for some expenses the Constitutional Court requested an express authorisation from the competent party organ, for others an explanation as to the nature of the expense was found to be sufficient without a supporting decision. For instance, although expenses for food offered to Tekel workers during their industrial action were found to be lawful on the sole basis of the explanation provided, the meals hosted for some federations or associations were deemed unlawful (see paragraph 19 above). Similarly, the applicant party’s explanation that the dinners organised in 2008 by the head of its youth branch had concerned election work was accepted in relation to two of those meals, and rejected for the rest, without any justification (see paragraph 18 above)."

The Court notes in this connection that it took the Constitutional Court, which conducted the entire inspection on the basis of a written procedure, approximately three years to finalise its inspection of the 2008 accounts and two years for the 2009 accounts. Bearing in mind the significant financial interests at stake for the applicant party, the Constitutional Court should have acted with special diligence to finalise the inspections in a timely manner, which would also have allowed the applicant party to regulate its conduct in order to avoid facing sanctions for similar expenditure in the following years (see the applicant party’s argument in paragraph 112 below).",

The Court, however, considers this to be a technical oversight, for it is clear from the wording of section 75 concerning the inspection duty of the Constitutional Court, as well as from the case-law of that court as demonstrated in its relevant decisions in the present case, that “registration as revenue with the State Treasury” mentioned in section 76 is a sanction applicable to all types of unlawful expenses."

The Court notes that although the aforementioned section 76 does not refer to a “warning” as an available sanction in relation to a violation of the financial provisions, section 104 is drafted in sufficiently broad terms to cover breaches of all mandatory provisions of the Act. Therefore, in theory, expenditure by a political party that contravenes sections 70-76 of the Act may be subject to a warning. This fact has been confirmed by the Government in their observations. It is also borne out by the decisions of the Constitutional Court at issue.

Nor is it possible to derive any clarification from the text of the Constitutional Court’s decisions in the instant case or from the nature of the expenses that were the subject of warnings, which do not appear to be different in nature from other unlawful expenses that resulted in confiscation orders. The Court notes, by way of example, that the Constitutional Court issued a warning on account of the applicant party’s failure to support the payment orders in relation to employees’ salaries with bank statements (see paragraph 31 above), whereas the submission of payment orders alone in relation to some other expenses resulted in confiscation orders (see paragraph 15 above). The Court further notes that the Constitutional Court issued both a confiscation order and a warning in relation to one of the unlawful items of expenditure in the 2009 accounts, without providing any justification for its decision (see paragraph 34 above)."

The Court further recognises the difficulty involved in providing comprehensive criteria to determine which of those activities may be considered to be in keeping with the objectives of a political party and to be genuinely related to party work. Nevertheless, having regard to the important role played by political parties in democratic societies, any legal regulations which may have the effect of interfering with their freedom of association, such as the inspection of their expenditure, must be couched in terms that provide a reasonable indication as to how those provisions will be interpreted and applied. In the instant case, the lack of precision of the relevant legal provisions, coupled with the apparent failure of the Constitutional Court to establish consistent case-law at the material time on how such provisions would be interpreted in practice deprived the applicant party of the possibility of regulating its expenditure accordingly. The Court notes that the amendments introduced to section 74 of the Political Parties Act in 2011 sought to remedy that vagueness, in terms of both the activities in relation to which a political party may incur expenses, and the scope of the Constitutional Court’s powers in reviewing the lawfulness of expenditure on those activities. Although the Court is not in a position to comment on the appropriateness of those amendments from the standpoint of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention, it nevertheless considers that they aimed to bring some clarity to the political parties’ entitlements and obligations regarding their expenditure, which the legislature must have considered was lacking."

The nature of the issues before the competent national court plays a decisive role here (see Hesse-Anger and Anger v. Germany (dec.), no. 45835/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI (extracts))). In the instant case, the proceedings before the Constitutional Court concerned the inspection of the applicant party’s financial accounts, which, as the Government stated, is a highly technical matter that may be sufficiently dealt with by way of a written procedure. Although the applicant party was not able to appear before the Constitutional Court to present its arguments orally, it had the opportunity to comment in writing on the expenses which the Constitutional Court deemed problematic and which later formed the basis of its findings of unlawfulness, and also to provide further information as requested (see table in the annex below). The Court reiterates in this connection that according to its case-law, a hearing may not be necessary, for example, when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties’ written observations (see, among many other authorities, Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no. 34721/09, § 33, 5 June 2012, and Meimanis, cited above, § 49 ). Having regard to the special nature of the proceedings in question, the applicant party has not made it clear how an oral hearing would have provided a better opportunity to defend the lawfulness of the expenditure in question, especially given that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court, but rather a more general right to present one’s case effectively before the court (see, among others, Margaretić v. Croatia, no. 16115/13, § 127, 5 June 2014 ). The Court also wishes to stress that political parties subject to financial inspection were not altogether deprived of the right to an oral hearing, as under section 30 of the now defunct Act on the Establishment and Rules of Procedure of the Constitutional Court of Turkey, the Constitutional Court could invite representatives of political parties to hear their explanations regarding their finances where it deemed this necessary, which it apparently did not do in the instant case."

The applicants submitted that the refusal of the Austrian authorities to grant legal personality to the first applicant by conferring on it the status of a religious society recognised under the Recognition Act violated their right to freedom of religion. In particular, before July 1998, the first applicant could not have been established as a legal entity and, thus, could not have entered into legal relations, concluded contracts or acquired assets. The first applicant had, thus far, no internal autonomy, could not hire the necessary religious ministers and was not entitled to perform its pastoral work for believers in hospitals or prisons. The second to fifth applicants, as leading executives of the first applicant, were also limited in exercising their right to freedom of religion. Neither the Basic Law 1867 nor the 1998 Religious Communities Act provided explicitly for the internal autonomy of a religious community. The Constitutional Court had found (in its judgment of 3 March 2001, B1713/98 – see paragraph 34 above ) that registered religious communities, unlike recognised religious societies, did not enjoy the right to comprehensive organisation and administration of their internal affairs without State interference. Lastly, the applicants contested that they would have had the possibility of forming an association under the Associations Act. They referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s finding of 1929 ( VfSlg. 1265/1929 ), confirming the administrative authorities ’ practice not to allow religious societies to form an association, and thus refusing the request of the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ( Ernste Bibelforscher ) to set up an association. Thereafter the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses had not tried again to form an association, but auxiliary associations ( Hilfsvereine ) with specialised religious aims had been created. The two examples of associations submitted by the Government were likewise merely auxiliary associations.

The right to autonomous administration of the entity ’ s internal organisation was likewise guaranteed. Referring to a judgment of the Constitutional Court ( VfSlg. 10.915/1986 ), the Government contended that the refusal of recognition did not impede the applicants ’ exercise of their right to freedom of religion within the meaning of Article 9 of the Convention. Against this background, they contested that the first applicant had no legal personality in Austria, was legally non- existent and could not acquire assets or enter into legal relations, because these allegations concerned the first applicant ’ s situation before it had obtained legal personality as a registered religious community on 11 July 1998.

The Court reiterates that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one ’ s] religion” alone and in private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260, p. 17, § 31; and Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-I). Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is, thus, an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, § 62)."

They repeated in essence their above complaints. In particular, the applicants disputed the necessity of the ten - year waiting period, as the recognition of the Coptic Orthodox Church by a specific law in 2003 (see paragraph 45(e) above) proved the contrary. The Coptic Orthodox Church had only existed in Austria since 1976 and had been registered as a religious community in 1998. The applicants argued that most of the registered religious communities and even most of the recognised religious societies did not fulfil the criterion for the minimum number of adherents, which showed that this requirement was unnecessary for the observance of public duties, contrary to what the Government maintained. Since the first applicant, which was the fifth largest religious community in Austria and was thus even bigger than most recognised religious societies, also complied with the necessary number of adherents, it should have been recognised a long time ago. Further, the requirement of the use of income and other assets for religious purposes, including charity activities, was discriminatory as it interfered in an unjustified way with the first applicant ’ s internal administration and organisation, in breach of both Article 9 of the Convention and Article 15 of the Basic Law 1867. The prerequisite of a positive attitude towards society and the State was discriminatory as it was not required in respect of any other natural or legal personality in Austria. Further, it did not meet the “prescribed by law” requirement under Article 9 § 2 of the Convention. The same applied to the criterion of non-interference with other religious societies. Moreover, under Austrian law, recognised religious societies enjoyed privileged treatment in various fields which did not extend to religious communities."

In respect of the ten - year waiting period for registered religious communities, the Government referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s finding of 3 March 2001 ( VfSlg. 12.102/2001 ) that that requirement served the legitimate aim of ensuring that the competent authority could verify during this period of time whether the religious community was ready to integrate into the existing legal order, in particular whether it performed unlawful activities as a consequence of which legal personality had to be withdrawn ( section 9 ( 2 ) and section 5 ( 1 ) of the Religious Communities Act). Examples of such unlawful activities were incitement to commit criminal offences, endangering the psychological development of minors, violating the psychological integrity of persons or using psychotherapeutic methods to disseminate its religious beliefs."

As regards the requirement of a certain number of adherents, the Government maintained that this criterion was not only important for the religious community ’ s existence but also for ensuring that certain duties were fulfilled, such as organising and monitoring the teaching of its beliefs in schools. The precondition of the use of income for religious purposes was also provided for under the 1874 Recognition Act ( sections 5 and 6) and was thus not new. Since recognised religious societies obtained the status of a legal person under public law, which entailed duties and obligations in the public interest, the requirement of a positive attitude towards society and the State – meaning acceptance of a pluralistic State and the basic principles of the rule of law, which did not preclude the disapproval of particular provisions for reasons of conscience – did not appear discriminatory. Finally, the obligation not to interfere illegally with recognised or other religious societies was not discriminatory either."

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions, and to this extent it is autonomous, there can be no room for its application unless the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see Petrovic v. Austria, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 585, § 22).

The Court would point out at the outset that in proceedings originating in an application lodged under Article 34 of the Convention it has to confine itself, as far as possible, to the examination of the concrete case before it. Its task is not to review domestic law and practice in abstracto and to express a view as to the compatibility of the provisions of legislation with the Convention, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to or affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see Eriksson v. Sweden, judgment of 22 June 1989, Series A no. 156, p. 23, § 54; Findlay v. United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 279, § 67; and Fédération Chrétienne des Témoins de Jéhovah de France v. France (dec.), no. 53430/99, ECHR 2001-XI). Accordingly, by the term “victim”, Article 34 of the Convention means the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue. Article 34 of the Convention may not be used to found an action in the nature of an actio popularis. It may only exceptionally entitle individuals to contend that a law violates their rights by itself, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if they run the risk of being directly affected by it (see Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland, judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246, p. 22, § 44; Norris v. Ireland, judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, pp. 15-16, §§ 30-32; and S.L. v.

In particular, it requires the existence of the religious association for at least twenty years in Austria and for at least ten years as a registered religious community; a minimum number of two adherents per thousand members of the Austrian population (at the moment, this means about 16,000 persons); the use of income and other assets for religious purposes, including charity activities; a positive attitude towards society and the State; and no illegal interference as regards the association ’ s relationship with recognised or other religious societies."

These areas include exemption from military service and civilian service, reduced tax liability or exemption from specific taxes, facilitation of the founding of schools, and membership of various boards (see “Relevant domestic law ” above ). Given the number of these privileges and their nature, in particular in the field of taxation, the advantage obtained by religious societies is substantial and this special treatment undoubtedly facilitates a religious society ’ s pursuance of its religious aims. In view of these substantive privileges accorded to religious societies, the obligation under Article 9 of the Convention incumbent on the State ’ s authorities to remain neutral in the exercise of their powers in this domain requires therefore that if a State sets up a framework for conferring legal personality on religious groups to which a specific status is linked, all religious groups which so wish must have a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner."

As the Minister had failed to give a decision, the Ombudsman ’ s Office, further to a complaint by the applicants, issued a notice on 5 February 1981 finding that the inactivity of the Minister constituted an undesirable state of affairs in public administration ( Missstand im Bereich der öffentlichen Verwaltung ). The applicants pointed out that the Constitutional Court had already found in 1988 ( VfSlg. 11.931/1988 ) that the Ministry was obliged to decide on a request for recognition. The lapse of time of nine years between their first request for recognition in 1978 and the one they submitted in 1987 had already been in breach of the reasonable - time requirement under Article 6 of the Convention. In 1992 the Constitutional Court had again decided that the applicants had a right to obtain a decision and even their complaint about the authority ’ s inactivity had not resulted in a decision. Only in December 1995 had the Administrative Court followed the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion and requested the Minister to give a decision and to submit the case file, but the Minister had failed to comply. It was not until the Administrative Court ’ s decision of 28 April 1997 that the Minister had been obliged to take a decision on the request for recognition. The Minister ’ s inactivity between 1992 and 1997, despite numerous requests to give a decision – even, eventually, by both the highest courts – could not be considered to have been unattributable to the administrative authorities as the Government contended. The Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court had likewise not decided speedily.

Referring to the cases of Canea Catholic Church (cited above, §§ 41-42) and Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others (cited above, §§ 141-142), the Government submitted that the question of non-recognition or recognition under the 1874 Recognition Act did not have any bearing on the first applicant ’ s assets either."

In particular, the Constitutional Court, in its decision of 4 October 1995, resolved the conflict of jurisdiction between the two highest courts and found that the applicants had a right to receive a decision on their request for recognition. After having been granted recognition as a religious community under the Act on the Legal Status of Registered Religious Communities on 20 July 1998, the applicants again applied to the Constitutional Court, challenging particular provisions of that act. It is true that the Constitutional Court dismissed this complaint on 14 March 2001, but the effectiveness of a remedy for the purposes of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome (see, among other authorities, Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1993, Series A no. 247 ‑ C, p. 62, § 40).

The Court has found a breach of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 9 in that the Austrian authorities, in rejecting the applicants ’ request of 22 July 1998 for recognition of the first applicant as a religious society, relied on a ground which was discriminatory. As there are various other requirements under the relevant law for recognition as a religious society and the first applicant would not have been automatically entitled to such recognition had the Austrian authorities not relied on that ground, the Court cannot speculate as to the outcome of such proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Société Colas Est and Others v.

The court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant ’ s dismissal for a repeated failure to properly perform his professional duties. Regarding the applicant ’ s participation in the strike, the court relied on the Railway Acts of 1995 and 2003 ( Articles 17 and 26 (2) respectively – see paragraphs 15 and 17 below ). The Acts prohibited strikes of railway workers responsible, inter alia, for the circulation of trains, shunting, and services to passengers. The court stressed that those limitations were aimed at securing safety on the railway and that railway workers were subjected to stricter disciplinary rules than workers in other sectors of industry. The applicant was a locomotive driver; therefore, his work was directly linked to the circulation of trains, shunting, and the provision of services to passengers. The District Court concluded that the applicant had been precluded from participating in the strike. Relying on a report dated 29 April 2008 issued by the Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor ’ s Office, the District Court furthermore noted that the strike had caused a number of cancelled and delayed trains which had resulted in “massive violations of the rights and lawful interests of citizens, leading to their belated arrival at their workplaces and educational institutions, at medical facilities providing health care, [and] for long-distance trains, bus runs and flights ”. The strike had also “contributed to the mass gathering of people on railway platforms, which [had] directly threatened their safety”. Given the above and the applicant ’ s earlier transgression, his dismissal had been justified.

A strike is thus considered as a means of resolving a collective labour dispute; the federal legislature has the right to determine when and under what conditions [a strike] is possible and when it is unacceptable, performing the necessary balancing exercise between the protection of the professional interests of employees and respect for the public interests to which the strike could cause damage.",

The functioning of this mode of transport is based on the principles of the operational continuity, accessibility, safety and quality of the services provided, and the coherence of the functioning of the unified transport system of the Russian Federation (Article 1 of the [2003 Railway Act ] ). In addition, vehicles used on the railway are a source of higher potential danger.",

Article 11 of the Convention nevertheless left each State a free choice as to the means to be used towards this end. The granting of the right to strike represented without a doubt one of the most important of these means, but there were others.

While the right to strike was a constitutional right set out in Article 37 of the Russian Constitution, no federal law provided an exact list of those categories of railway workers whose right to strike was prohibited. As no such federal law existed, any sanctions or penalties for participation in strikes applied to locomotive drivers ( including the applicant ) had no legal basis and were arbitrary."

In particular, he claimed that the strike had been lawful under Article 413 § 1 because it had not threatened the country ’ s defence and State security or the life and health of people. The applicant could not agree with the Government that any circumstances affecting regular train circulation and infringing someone ’ s interests would necessarily threaten the country ’ s defence, State security or the life and health of people and would thus justify a ban on certain categories of railway workers ’ right to strike. The applicant alleged that the Russian authorities had failed to demonstrate and provide any solid evidence of the alleged threat to the country ’ s defence, State security, or the life and health of people posed by strikes by locomotive drivers in general and by the strike of 28 April 2008 in particular. As regards the latter, the applicant noted that the strike of 28 April 2008 had started at 4 a.m. By the time the applicant had arrived at his place of work at 10.30 a.m., the locomotive drivers participating in the strike had been already replaced by replacement drivers. Thus, the applicant believed that his participation in the strike had not affected railway traffic, as traffic controllers had had an opportunity to replace him with other workers."

However, the Court also finds that the 2003 Railway Act specifies that until such list is adopted, Article 17 of the 1995 Railway Act is to remain in force (see paragraph 16 above), thus, it cannot be said that there is a gap in the legislation. When dealing with the applicant ’ s case the national courts relied on both Articles 17 and 26 § 2 of the 1995 and 2003 Railway Acts respectively. They interpreted those two provisions to the effect that all occupations (by contrast to only some, mentioned in the list) “connected to the circulation of trains, shunting and provision of services to passengers and of freight services on public railways”, were prohibited from participation in strikes. The Court was not presented with the evidence of any contradictory application or diverging interpretations of the two provisions by public authorities or legal scholars, or of any alleged inconsistency with other laws (see, by contrast, Veniamin Tymoshenko and Others v.

However, neither the ILO nor the ECSR consider transport in general, and railway transport in particular to constitute an essential service, an interruption of which could endanger the life or health of (a part of) the population (see section 587 of the ILO ’ s Digest of decisions and principles, cited in paragraph 20 above; see also paragraph 23 above). The Court notes that both the ILO (see paragraphs 21-23 above) and the ECSR (see paragraph 26 ) have regularly criticised Russian legislation banning railway workers ’ right to strike.

Second, even assuming that railway transport was an essential service, serious restrictions such as a complete ban on the right to strike in respect of certain categories of railway workers would still require solid evidence from the State to justify their necessity. While a work stoppage on railway transport obviously could lead to negative economic consequences, the Court cannot agree that these would be sufficient to justify a complete ban on certain categories of railway workers ’ right to strike; any strike implies certain economic losses, but it does not follow that any strike could be prohibited for risk of those losses.

In the latter case the Respondent Government showed estimated revenue losses for both private and State companies and the projected negative effects on tax collection and the State ’ s financial commitments. It also relied on breaches of Norway ’ s international contracts for gas and oil supply.

                "85. What the circumstances of this case show is that the applicant union in fact exercised two of the elements of freedom of association that have been identified as essential, namely, the right for a trade union to seek to persuade the employer to hear what it has to say on behalf of its members, and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The strike by its Hydrex members was part of that exercise, and while it did not achieve its aim, it was not in vain either since it led the company to revise its offer, which the applicant union then commended to its members. Although the Government criticised the applicant union for supporting the revised offer at the time and then reversing its stance in the present proceedings, the Court recognises that the union was bound to respect its members ’ negative vote. Yet the fact that the process of collective bargaining and industrial action, including strike action against the employer of the union members who were the subject of the dispute, did not lead to the outcome desired by the applicant union and its members does not mean that the exercise of their Article 11 rights was illusory. The right to collective bargaining has not been interpreted as including a “right” to a collective agreement (see, in this respect, Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 158, where the Court observed that the absence of any obligation on the authorities to actually enter into a collective agreement was not part of the case). Nor does the right to strike imply a right to prevail. As the Court has often stated, what the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11, to strive for the protection of their members ’ interests ( ibid., § 141, and, more recently Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun” v. Romania [GC], no. 2330/09, § 34, ECHR 2013). This the applicant union and its members involved in the dispute were largely able to do in the present case."

Dissatisfied with the company ’ s offer, it decided to embark on industrial action and on 24 September gave the requisite ballot notice to the company (see paragraph 18 below). The notice described the category of workers that would be voting on industrial action as “Engineer/Technician” and stated how many of such were based at each site. The following day the company wrote to the applicant union, stating that it did not recognise the term “Technician” (it categorised its workers in a more precise way: fitters, jointers, test - room inspectors, day testers, shift testers, OLBI fitters). It considered the ballot notice served on it was therefore not compliant with the relevant statutory provisions.

The judge did not accept the applicant union ’ s claim that the statutory requirements unduly restricted the exercise of its right to call industrial action, this same argument having been rejected by the Court of Appeal in the case of Metrobus Ltd v. Unite the Union ([2009] EWCA Civ 829). He also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it. Instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction. Given the sector involved, the implications of a shutdown would be substantial, with widespread ramifications elsewhere. Addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted, the judge found that it had not, since the union ’ s members at Tufnell Park included persons working at different trades. The applicant union was not under an absolute duty, but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company. The fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive. Similarly, the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration, but not necessarily a decisive one. The applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment – it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so. Finally, the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike (the ballot not having taken place), there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer ’ s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action. The applicant union ’ s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach."

The set of facts relied on under this head involved some RMT members who were employed in railway maintenance by Fastline Limited, a company that formed part of a group of companies known as Jarvis plc. Another company in the group, Jarvis Rail Limited, was engaged in rail engineering work. At the time, Fastline and Jarvis Rail Limited (“Jarvis”) employed approximately 1,200 persons in total, 569 of whom were members of the RMT. In August 2007, Fastline transferred part of its undertaking, comprising twenty employees, to another company known as Hydrex Equipment (UK) Ltd (“Hydrex”). These employees ’ existing terms and conditions were preserved by Hydrex, as required by law (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006). According to the applicant union, the employees involved were nonetheless concerned for their situation, as Hydrex workers were paid significantly less. It also appeared that trade unions had less influence in that company."

This meant a reduction in salary of some 36-40%, according to the applicant union. In the months that followed, the applicant union made representations to Hydrex on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement. When the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan, the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned (seventeen by that stage). They voted in favour of a strike, which took place between 6 November and 9 November 2009. During the strike, the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work. This caused Hydrex to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer ’ s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action (see paragraph 19 below)."

Nine votes were cast, all of them rejecting the Hydrex offer. According to the applicant union, its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the Hydrex workforce. These were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company, whose activities had not really been disrupted at all. The applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its members ’ interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its Jarvis members as well. The simple threat of a strike on this scale, and a fortiori an actual stoppage, would have exerted significantly more pressure on Hydrex to maintain existing terms and conditions. The applicant union stated that Jarvis employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at Hydrex. Instead, the Hydrex members had had to stand alone, and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions. They did so under protest."

The applicant union disputed that interpretation. It noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes. It was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before 1980 and, consequently, impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in 1980 and 1990. In the applicant union ’ s view, secondary action had been relatively rare, the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes. It referred to official figures (contained in a Government publication, the “Employment Gazette”) indicating that, since the 1960s, the United Kingdom was consistently close to the European average for days lost to industrial action. According to this source, the country had been middle-ranking since the end of the 1970s. The only exception was for 1984, on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year. The Government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution, given the profound transformation of Europe over the past twenty years.

The Committee requested the Government to continue to provide information on any developments, as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements. The Committee notes the Government ’ s indication that the Court of Appeal decision in RMT v. Serco and in ASLEF v. London Midland (2011) EWCA 226, overturned injunctions which had been obtained by Serco and London Midland Railway against the two main national transport unions, the RMT and ASLEF. In both cases, the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the unions ’ breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures. This case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of unions ’ technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place. In the RMT v. Serco decision, the Court of Appeal issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements. A Court of Appeal decision is binding on all lower courts. Subsequent to this case, in Balfour Beatty v. Unite (2012) EWHC 267 (QB), the Court found against Balfour Beatty, taking account of the Serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers. The Committee notes the TUC ’ s observation that, while it greatly welcomes both decisions, it considers that they do not fully address the problems arising under the legislation that it has identified and that the legislation continues to impose intolerable demands on trade unions. The Committee notes these developments with interest and requests the Government to provide its comments on the concerns raised by the TUC. ” [2]"

                "“The Committee notes that the common law renders virtually all forms of strikes or other industrial action unlawful as a matter of civil law. This means that workers and unions who engage in such action are liable to be sued for damages by employers (or other parties) who suffer loss as a consequence, and (more importantly in practical terms) may be restrained from committing unlawful acts by means of injunctions (issued on both an interlocutory and a permanent basis). It appears to the Committee that unrestricted access to such remedies would deny workers the right to take strikes or other industrial action in order to protect and to promote their economic and social interests.",
                "It is most important, therefore, that workers and unions should have some measure of protection against civil liability. There has been legislative recognition of this imperative since 1906 in the form of a series of ‘ immunities ’ (or, more accurately, ‘ protections ’ ) against tort action for trade unions and their members and officials. The current version of the ‘ immunities ’ is to be found in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.",
                "The scope of these protections has been narrowed in a number of respects since 1980. The Committee notes, for example, that section 15 of the 1974 Act has been amended so as to limit the right to picket to a worker ’ s own place of work or, in the case of a trade union official, the place of work of the relevant membership, whilst section 17 of the 1980 Act removes protection from ‘ secondary action ’ in the sense of action directed against an employer who is not directly a party to a given trade dispute. In addition, the definition of ‘ trade dispute ’ in section 29 of the 1974 Act has been narrowed so as to encompass only disputes between workers and their own employer, rather than disputes between ‘ employers and workers ’ or ‘ workers and workers ’ as was formerly the case.",
                "Taken together, these changes appear to make it virtually impossible for workers and unions lawfully to engage in any form of boycott activity, or ‘ sympathetic ’ action against parties not directly involved in a given dispute. The Committee has never expressed any decided view on the use of boycotts as an exercise of the right to strike. However, it appears to the Committee that where a boycott relates directly to the social and economic interests of the workers involved in either or both of the original dispute and the secondary action, and where the original dispute and the secondary action are not unlawful in themselves, then that boycott should be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. This is clearly consistent with the approach the Committee has adopted in relation to ‘ sympathy strikes ’ :",
                "It would appear that more frequent recourse is being had to this form of action (i.e. sympathy strikes) because of the structure or the concentration of industries or the distribution of work centres in different regions of the world. The Committee considers that a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful.”"

The lifting of immunity opens such industrial action to be actionable in tort and therefore would constitute a serious impediment to the workers ’ right to carry out sympathy strikes.”",

In its previous comments, the Committee had noted that according to the TUC, due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system, it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, transferring work, or hiving off companies. The Committee generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though, in certain cases, the direct employer may not be party to the dispute, and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. The Committee takes note of the Government indication that: (1) its position remains as set out in its report for 2006 ‑ 08, that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area; and (2) this issue forms part of a matter brought before the ECHR by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and that the Court has yet to consider the case. The Committee recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers ’ organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their members ’ interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined. In these circumstances, the Committee once again requests the Government to review sections 223 and 224 of the TULRA, in full consultation with the social partners, and to provide further information in its next report on the outcome of these consultations. ” [4]"

The facts of the practical example provided, as reported by the applicant union, indicate that, while the union experienced some delay in taking action to protect the interests of its members, it succeeded in holding a strike two months later. That action, by the applicant union ’ s own admission, induced EDF to improve its offer to union members, who accepted it and it took effect as a collective agreement shortly afterwards. That successful outcome cannot be disregarded. It would be artificial for the Court to consider the issuing of the injunction against the RMT in isolation from subsequent events. In sum, there is no basis here for the Court to find that the applicant union ’ s exercise of its rights under Article 11 of the Convention has been interfered with, over and above being required to comply with the procedural requirements set down in law, which it succeeded in doing. While those requirements have been the subject of criticism by other international bodies (see paragraphs 26-37 above), the Court can only examine complaints in light of their concrete facts. It considers that what the EDF situation discloses in reality is ultimately successful collective action by the applicant union on behalf of its members.

By a letter of 6 June 2013, the applicant union informed the Court that it had “irrevocably withdrawn” that complaint. The Government submitted that maintaining two international complaints in parallel for several years and then withdrawing one of them so as to gain a tactical advantage before the Court should be considered an abuse of the right of application. They added that Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention ( see paragraph 48 below) should not be construed so as to limit its effect strictly to cases where the applicant has already submitted the matter to another international procedure.

This was because the United Kingdom had simply ignored the criticism voiced by the relevant ILO bodies, whereas it would be bound to execute a judgment in the applicant union ’ s favour. The withdrawal of the complaint to the ILO, before any decision was taken by the Committee on Freedom of Association, meant that the prospect of a plurality of international proceedings relating to the same case had been dispelled."

Instead, it was plain from the very wording of that provision that it contemplated collective action by workers to protect their own interests. Sympathy strikes, which were no more than a show of solidarity with another group of workers, lacked the requisite nexus between collective action and the direct interests of the persons taking part in it. It did not appear from the facts adduced that the situation of the RMT members employed by Hydrex had any real bearing on the situation of their union colleagues employed by Jarvis.

The applicant union argued that the ban on secondary action had seriously limited its ability to protect its Hydrex members effectively against a drastic cut to their terms and conditions of employment. Had it been possible to organise a sympathy strike at Jarvis, it was highly probable that Hydrex would have desisted from changing matters for the worse. With so few members employed by Hydrex, the effect of the strike had been negligible. The very limited possibility of lawful picketing had made no difference. The revised offer made by management, despite being presented in a positive light by the union leadership, had been unanimously rejected by those polled as totally inadequate. The applicant union stated that a strike by its Jarvis members would have been motivated not just by solidarity with fellow union members who had been their former colleagues, but also by concern to preserve their own terms and conditions. Given the highly competitive environment in which they were employed, a decision by one company to reduce its staffing costs could well trigger similar cuts in rival companies. As the Hydrex situation illustrated, it was easy for a company to terminate the employment of workers and then rehire them on less favourable terms. The ban on secondary action had the effect of undermining trade - union action on behalf of all its members in a given sector, to the detriment of all such workers. From 1980 onwards, there had been a significant and steady decline in the role of collective agreements in the British economy, which made it all the more vital to permit trade unions to act effectively on their members ’ behalf, protecting those in positions of greater weakness. In the applicant union ’ s view it was only in the period before 1980 that the right to take secondary strike action had been adequately protected in domestic law. The government of the day had not considered it necessary to restrict it. The clear object of the 1980 and 1992 legislation had been to undermine the role and influence of trade unions, leaving workers in a weakened position. The Government ’ s claims that strike action had damaged the economy in the 1970s and 1980s lacked substantiation, and were moreover exaggerated and inaccurate. Despite the lack of any real evidence, trade unions had been unjustly blamed for Britain ’ s economic woes for over thirty years, and were for this reason subject to very restrictive legislation."

Replying to the Government ’ s argument that secondary action, by its nature, had the effect of embroiling other employers in industrial disputes to which they were not party and over which they had no control, the applicant union submitted that such considerations were irrelevant to the facts of this case. It would only have called out the Jarvis workforce, which would have been sufficient to induce Hydrex to leave existing terms and conditions intact. In any event, the applicant union rejected as generalisations the Government ’ s arguments regarding the disruptive effects of secondary strikes and the risks these posed to the Convention rights of third parties (interference with businesses, threats to livelihoods, and even – in extreme situations – to life and health). Sufficient safeguards existed elsewhere in the law, including the criminal law. There was thus no justification for a complete ban on secondary action. A less restrictive regime could surely be devised, as required by the principle of proportionality.

Citing several of this Court ’ s judgments and decisions in trade - union cases, the applicant union argued that the taking of strike action must now be regarded in its own right as an essential element of freedom of association that States must respect. Alternatively, the Court having identified collective bargaining as an essential element of trade - union rights, it must logically follow that the right to strike was equally essential, since without the threat of industrial action, collective bargaining would be deprived of any effectiveness and be little more than “collective begging”. The ban on secondary action thus impaired the essence of freedom of association. This could be accepted only upon proof of some truly compelling justification. The State must meet a stringent test of necessity, with only a limited margin of appreciation, subject to the very rigorous scrutiny of the Court."

                "56. The applicant union urged the Court to reject any narrow concept of trade - union freedom of association that would be limited to the protection of the strictly personal interests of individual workers. Such an interpretation would impoverish the substance of Article 11. In the many cases it had decided involving strikes, the Court had never attached any significance to what was at stake for the workers in the dispute. It was entirely legitimate for unions to pursue broader, common objectives. Trade unionism was fundamentally about solidarity among union members and among workers more generally, and the wording of Article 11 of the Convention should be construed in keeping with this. Workers should be able to take industrial action to protect those who may be prevented from doing so, or who, on their own, lack the collective strength to defend their interests at work. This broad concept of freedom of association was espoused by the two most eminent international bodies in the field of trade - union rights, the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. Both had repeatedly criticised the United Kingdom for its ban on secondary action, which they deemed to be incompatible with the relevant international legal standards. These had been interpreted to mean that the only acceptable condition that could be attached to secondary action was that the primary dispute itself be lawful. The applicant union urged the Court to adopt the same position. If that were overbroad, a criterion of proximity might be envisaged, that is to say, a requirement of a link of some sort between workers engaged in primary action and those striking in sympathy with them. Such a link was present here, since the group of workers concerned had originally been Jarvis employees and continued to perform the same work at the same sites after the transfer. A worsening in their terms and conditions could have had negative consequences for all workers in that sector. In the modern economy, the workforce was becoming increasingly fragmented through the transfer of undertakings or part of them, the creation of complex corporate structures, agency work, privatisation, the contracting-out of services leading to further sub-contracting, non-genuine self-employment, and so forth. This led to a situation in which persons performing the same job at the same place of work could have different employers, meaning that they could not legally support one another in time of industrial conflict."

They noted that, as required by domestic law, the group of ex-Jarvis employees had continued to enjoy their previous terms and conditions of employment after the transfer, and this had continued for a period of two years. At that point, as shown by the documents submitted by the applicant union, the company ’ s financial difficulties led it to propose new, less advantageous contracts to the persons concerned. The applicant union defended their interests by making representations and ultimately through strike action that led to an improved offer. While that offer had been rejected, and the applicant union now described it as inadequate, it had in fact been endorsed at the time by the RMT General Secretary, who had considered the strike a success and urged union members to vote in favour of acceptance."

As long as industrial action was organised in compliance with the relevant statutory provisions, the individual worker was protected against dismissal and the trade union enjoyed immunity in tort. The domestic courts had held that the statutory regime was compatible with Article 11, as interpreted by this Court ( see Metrobus Ltd, cited in paragraph 11 above). The Government clarified that Parliament had taken care to ensure that the general ban on secondary action did not curtail primary action – secondary action would be lawful if it also constituted primary action in relation to another dispute (section 224(5) of the 1992 Act). Moreover, persons taking part in industrial action were permitted to mount a peaceful picket at or near their place of work with a view to peacefully persuading others to withdraw their labour."

                "61. According to the Government, the present statutory framework came about as a reaction to the widespread disruptions caused to the British economy by widespread secondary action in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to the enactment of the Employment Act 1980, trade unions had enjoyed a very broad power to organise secondary action, with highly detrimental consequences for businesses and their workforces, as well as for the general public. A dispute in one part of the economy could rapidly spill over into others, embroiling third parties in it who had no stake in the conflict and no real means of resolving it. Just how permissive the legislation in force at that time was became fully apparent in the McShane case (see paragraph 22 above). The government of the day had determined that this should be restricted, and the parliamentary debates contained many actual examples of the damage and disruption wrought by unrestricted secondary strikes. Ten years later, the government considered that even in its more restricted form secondary action had the potential to damage the economy, notably by deterring multinational companies from developing their operations in the United Kingdom. Parliament had accordingly introduced the current ban. Although the Labour Party, then in opposition, had opposed the move, it had never sought to reverse it during its thirteen -year tenure in government. Nor was the current coalition government minded to revisit the issue. This indicated the very broad political acceptance in the United Kingdom of the current balance struck regarding the right to strike."

But this was by no means an absolute right – it could be subject to conditions and restrictions in accordance with Article 11 § 2 that were within the State ’ s margin of appreciation. Nor did the Government consider secondary action an essential element of freedom of association, finding no support for such a proposition in the relevant case-law of the Court, none of which concerned secondary action."

Rather, their reading of that case-law was that there had to be a nexus between the employees ’ interests and the action taken by their trade union on their behalf, be it collective bargaining or strike action. This was absent in the Hydrex situation. Secondary action by Jarvis employees in support of their former colleagues would have been on the basis of solidarity only – such action would not have had any real connection to their own interests via-à-vis Jarvis, with whom they had no dispute. Accordingly, the restriction on secondary action did not impinge on any essential element of freedom of association. There was thus no interference with the right set out in Article 11 § 1."

As the Court had recognised in its case-law, the margin in this area must be a wide one in light of the sensitive social and political considerations involved and the very significant differences between the national industrial - relations frameworks in Europe. In any event, the situation should be examined in light of Article 11 as a whole, which called for a balancing exercise between the effects of the restriction on the applicant union ’ s rights and the potential effects of secondary action on third parties. Regarding the former element, the Government pointed out that the ban on secondary action did not interfere with the ability of a trade union to take primary action in defence of its members ’ own interests. Against that must be set the far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on the rights and freedoms of others, including their rights under the Convention, specifically under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and, it could not be excluded, under Article 2. Where the balancing exercise involved competing Convention rights, the case-law of the Court allowed a broad margin of appreciation for the national authorities. In the view of the Government, the balance struck in the United Kingdom was a defensible one."

                "65. An additional consideration was the highly decentralised industrial - relations structure in the United Kingdom, which stood in contrast to the situation in many other European States. The Government considered that this had amplified the disruptive effect of secondary action in the 1970s, and would do so again were the Court to find the situation incompatible with the requirements of the Convention. It should also be borne in mind that – again in contrast to other national systems in Europe – trade unions already had broad freedom to take strike action. In the British system there was no concept of a “peace clause”, that is a binding undertaking not to take industrial action during the currency of a collective agreement. Nor was there any rule of proportionality to limit the intensity or extent of a strike, which was entirely a matter for trade unions to determine. Responding to the applicant union ’ s point about the decline of collective bargaining over the past thirty years, the Government indicated its neutrality on the issue – whether workers and employers wished to engage collectively or otherwise was a matter for them to decide. The Government disputed that the decline was due to the ban on secondary action or any other restriction referred to by the applicant union. There were other factors at work, such as the privatisation of many former public enterprises whose workforces had traditionally been highly unionised, and the marked development of labour law, conferring many more rights on workers that could be enforced through the courts rather than through the intervention of trade unions."

The Government rejected the applicant union ’ s suggestion that the outright ban on secondary action might be replaced with a restriction based on some concept of proximity or remoteness. These were inherently vague concepts and any rule formulated in such terms would inevitably generate legal uncertainty and so could be expected to give rise to litigation. In reality, what the applicant union sought was the right to organise strike action purely on the ground of solidarity between workers in different companies, the only condition being that the primary strike be lawful. This was a plea for no restriction at all on secondary action, eliminating any balancing exercise. No such indiscriminate right could be derived from Article 11. While the applicant union asserted that the Hydrex situation did not present the risk of a broad overspill into other sectors, this was not a relevant point – Parliament had decided against permitting any case-by-case consideration but had preferred a clear and uniform rule. Accordingly, the ban was either in conformity with the Convention or it was not. In the latter eventuality, the consequence would be to open up a very broad right to take secondary action, with all of the potential ramifications of this for society."

                "69. The above analysis was not, in the Government ’ s view, affected by the provisions of other international texts referred to by the applicant union. Regarding Article 6 § 4 of the Social Charter, the Government considered that the ECSR regarded the right to strike as integral to the process of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in cases of conflicts of interest between them. This corresponded to primary industrial action, where workers ’ interests were directly engaged, not to secondary. The Government further observed that the ECSR was not a judicial or quasi-judicial organ, but simply an independent body that submitted its conclusions to the Committee of Ministers annually. It was the latter that had the power to adopt recommendations to States in relation to any instance of non-compliance with the Charter. As far as the ban on secondary action was concerned, the Committee of Ministers had never taken a stance. In any event, the basis for the ECSR ’ s critique of the United Kingdom in this respect was that the ban could have the effect of preventing workers from striking against the “real” or de facto employer, where this is a distinct entity from the direct employer. This was also the basis for the criticism voiced by the ILO Committee of Experts, but it had no relevance to the Hydrex situation, which formed the factual basis for the Court ’ s examination of the issue. In any event, that Committee was not a judicial or quasi-judicial body either, and its interpretation of ILO Conventions was not definitive. Rather, its role was to provide impartial and technical evaluation of the state of application of international labour standards. In fact, the question of a right to strike was currently the cause of sharp controversy within the ILO, as part of which the status of the interpretations given by the Committee of Experts had been called into question. In addition, the Government perceived a divergence of view between the Committee of Experts and the Committee on Freedom of Association, the latter regarding the right to strike as applying only to the defence of one ’ s economic interests. It was noteworthy that the ILO Governing Body had refrained from taking any position on the situation. The Government thus did not accept that the United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under Convention No. 87."

Given the great diversity of the different industrial - relations systems in Europe, any superficial comparison on this precise point would be of limited assistance. Contrary to what the applicant union asserted, that diversity pleaded in favour of a wide margin of appreciation."

                "71. The two organisations stated their view that the right to strike is absolutely essential to the functioning of trade unionism in free societies, and that a total ban on secondary action is unacceptable. They referred to a series of international treaties that expressly recognise the right to strike, or have been authoritatively interpreted as protecting that right. In the jurisprudence of the ILO supervisory bodies, the right to strike was widely applied and strongly protected. There could be restrictions, but these must not be such as to result in practice in an excessive limitation of the right to strike. Sympathy strikes had to be permitted. This was also clearly established in the jurisprudence of the ECSR. The complete ban on secondary action meant that workers in dispute could not in any circumstances call on members of their own union for support, or of any other trade union with which their own was associated at a higher level ( for example, a federation or confederation). This diminished the very purpose of joining a trade union, and undermined the purpose of this dimension of Article 11 of the Convention, which reflected the principle that workers should be free to combine for mutual support in times of crisis. The ban was a relatively recent innovation, coming in more than eight decades after the foundational statute in British industrial relations, the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. The Government had failed to justify the restriction before the ILO Committee of Experts. In particular, that Committee had not accepted the Government ’ s argument that the ban was made necessary by the decentralised nature of the British system of industrial relations. On the contrary, the Committee considered that this made it more important for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, by transferring work or by hiving off companies. Workers in the United Kingdom were forbidden to take action in support of colleagues employed by another employer forming part of the same group of companies, even though they stood to be affected by the outcome of the dispute. That could not be right. The two organisations expressed their dismay that the Government was ignoring the need to amend the law and refusing to bring it up to the level of minimum international standards. The centre of gravity among European States appeared to lie somewhere between the total prohibition of such action and no restriction at all. The total ban in force in the United Kingdom was an unjustifiable restraint on the right to freedom of association, which could not be justified in all circumstances to protect the rights and freedoms of others."

                "72. Liberty considered that the ban on secondary action was an unjustified interference with the rights of workers and their trade unions. In many situations, workers were not in fact able to exercise their right under Article 11 to take industrial action; for example, those employed in very small establishments, or working for entities where terms and conditions are effectively determined by a third party such as a client, or those with insecure employment status. The traditional set-up in which all the members of the same workforce had the same employer no longer corresponded to the reality of a large and growing category of workers. It had been estimated that over three million jobs were now outsourced in the British economy, a great many of these from the public sector, where union density had traditionally been highest. This fragmentation of the traditional labour market had implications for labour law generally, and made it increasingly difficult for trade unions to continue to defend the interests of their members, who were increasingly dispersed among different economic operators. In this context, the effect of the ban on secondary strikes was to greatly reduce the value of trade - union membership, as it prevented the union from mobilising broadly in solidarity with and so as to protect the interests of members in dispute with their direct employer. The ban made it easy for companies to undercut the influence of trade unions by reconfiguring their organisations. It was clearly established in domestic case-law that the corporate veil could not be lifted in such circumstances. This deprived trade unions of the possibility of taking effective action against those with real decision-making power or control. Before 1980, the scope for secondary strikes was very broad, as illustrated by the House of Lords in N.W.L. Ltd v. Woods ([1979] 1 WLR 1294), which recognised the lawfulness of industrial action by dock workers taken in solidarity with foreign seafarers working for very little pay on flagged-out vessels. The ban denied some workers their only source of effective union support in the form of financial pressure exerted on the employer ’ s commercial relationships. It also hindered freedom of association in small firms ( fewer than twenty-one employees), which were excluded from the statutory procedure for recognising trade unions. If such an employer refused to recognise a trade union on a voluntary basis, the ban on secondary action made it impossible for fellow members in other workplaces to take industrial action so as to induce the employer to accept trade - union representation."

Liberty argued that this Court had consistently protected the substance of workers ’ freedom of association, and had never accorded any significance to whether a strike was of the primary or any other type. While the right to take secondary action could be restricted in accordance with the terms of Article 11 § 2, and balanced against competing rights and freedoms, this could not go so far as to impair the very essence of the right."

                "74. The Government replied to Liberty ’ s observations, observing that the latter addressed broader, background issues that were not relevant to the facts of the present case. While accepting that the structure of the labour market had evolved over the past two decades, the Government disagreed that this had generally hindered the enjoyment by the workers concerned of the benefits of trade - union rights. Practice actually showed that trade unions were capable of acting effectively in such circumstances – the three examples referred to by Liberty were in fact instances of the successful resolution of an industrial dispute via trade - union involvement (the three examples were: one involving airline catering staff, one concerning bus drivers in London during the 2012 Olympics, and one involving fuel lorry drivers). The charge that workers were prevented from taking action against the party that really determines their terms and conditions was no more than a hypothesis – no actual examples had been given. Nor had there been any decline in the number of days lost to strike action each year for the past twenty years, which tended to refute Liberty ’ s view that domestic law had increasingly restricted trade - union freedom. In this respect, the United Kingdom was close to the European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. As to the assertion that the threshold of twenty-one employees represented a loophole that employers could easily exploit in order to avoid having to recognise a trade union, the Government did not see its relevance to the facts of the case. Even so, there were safeguards in place to prevent employers from circumventing their statutory duty. Only genuine small firms were excluded, and that was for valid policy reasons. Finally, the Government submitted that there was no explicit support in the Court ’ s case-law for the proposition that the right to take secondary action is an essential element of freedom of association, or that the ban could not be justified under Article 11 § 2.",

Although it is possible to derive such a meaning from the language of the text taken on its own, the Court would observe that, as provided in Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the provisions of a treaty are to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context and in the light of the treaty ’ s object and purpose. Furthermore, it has often stated that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 92, ECHR 2013, with further references therein). In this regard, it is clear from the passages set out above ( see paragraphs 26-37) that secondary action is recognised and protected as part of trade - union freedom under ILO Convention No. 87 and the European Social Charter. Although the Government have put a narrower construction on the positions adopted by the supervisory bodies that operate under these two instruments, these bodies have criticised the United Kingdom ’ s ban on secondary action because of a perceived risk of abuse by employers, and have illustrated this with some examples. The Government further queried the authority, for the purposes of the Convention, to be attributed to the interpretative pronouncements of the expert bodies tasked with supervising compliance with these specialised international standards. The Court will consider this later in its analysis. For now it suffices to refer to the following passage from the judgment in Demir and Baykara v.Turkey ( [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, ECHR 2008 ):",

It follows that the statutory ban on secondary action as it operated in the example relied on by the applicant union constitutes an interference with its rights under this provision.

                "80. As to the aim of the interference, the applicant union argued that it found no legitimation in Article 11 § 2. It clearly did not concern national security or public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, or the protection of health or morals. As for the remaining aim recognised as legitimate, namely the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”, the applicant union ’ s argument was that it would be illogical to restrict the right to strike on account of the impact of such action on the employer. The very purpose of strike action is to have a strong impact on the employer ’ s position, to induce the employer to meet the demands of labour. It would be erroneous to allow this to serve as a justification for curbing the right to strike. The applicant union therefore invited the Court to reconsider the reasoning followed in this regard in UNISON v. the United Kingdom ( ( dec. ), no. 53574/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), in which the Court had accepted that the restriction on strike action concerned the “rights of others”, referring to the employer. The economic interests of an employer should not be permitted to take precedence over the human rights of employees. Such reasoning contradicted the approach of the ECSR, for example, which did not accept any principle of proportionality between the taking of strike action and the consequences of this on the employer ’ s interests. The applicant union further argued that the UNISON decision sat ill with the earlier judgment of the Court in Gustafsson v. Sweden (25 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II). There the Court had not entertained the applicant ’ s complaint that the trade - union boycott of his business was an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Nor had it accepted that the impact on his business, although it caused considerable economic damage, gave rise to any positive obligation on the State to come to his aid. The Court should instead take a stringent approach as it had done in two cases involving sanctions against public-sector employees who participated in a one-day strike ( Karaçay v. Turkey, no. 6615/03, 27 March 2007 and Kaya and Seyhan v. Turkey, no. 30946/04, 15 September 2009). In each case the Court had not been persuaded that the interferences in question pursued legitimate aims, although it ultimately had left that point open in view of its finding that the interferences complained of were not “necessary in a democratic society”."

In light of the potentially far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on third parties, protecting the latter was clearly a legitimate objective that Parliament had pursued when it introduced the ban.

The latter concerned primary strike action, the complaint being that the applicant trade union had been prevented from taking industrial action in defence of its members ’ future interests, in the context of the impending privatisation of hospital services. During the domestic proceedings the Court of Appeal held that the impact of such a strike on members of the public was irrelevant to the legal issues arising. This Court took the same view, and for this reason the aim of “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” was taken in the circumstances as referring just to the employer ’ s rights. The ground for distinguishing the present case is the fact that it concerns secondary action. As the Government have argued, by its nature secondary action may well have much broader ramifications than primary action. It has the potential to impinge upon the rights of persons not party to the industrial dispute, to cause broad disruption within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the public. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that in banning secondary action, Parliament pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, not limited to the employer side in an industrial dispute.",

It remains to be determined whether the statutory ban on secondary industrial action, in as much as it affected the ability of the applicant union to protect the interests of its Hydrex members, can be regarded as being “necessary in a democratic society”. To be so considered, it must be shown that the interference complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, that the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient and that it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

                "84. The Court will first consider the applicant union ’ s argument that the right to take strike action must be regarded as an essential element of trade - union freedom under Article 11, so that to restrict it would be to impair the very essence of freedom of association. It observes that it has already decided a number of cases in which restrictions on industrial action were found to have given rise to violations of Article 11 (see, for example, Karaçay, cited above; Dilek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 74611/01, 26876/02 and 27628/02, 17 July 2007; Urcan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23018/04 and 10 others, 17 July 2008; and Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen v. Turkey, no. 68959/01, 21 April 2009). The applicant union placed great emphasis on the last of these judgments, in which the term “indispensable corollary” was used in relation to the right to strike, linking it to the right to organise ( see Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen, cited above, § 24). It should, however, be noted that the judgment was here adverting to the position adopted by the supervisory bodies of the ILO rather than evolving the interpretation of Article 11 by conferring a privileged status on the right to strike. More generally, what the above-mentioned cases illustrate is that strike action is clearly protected by Article 11. The Court does not therefore discern any need in the present case to determine whether the taking of industrial action should now be accorded the status of an essential element of the Article 11 guarantee."
            ],
            [
                "85. What the circumstances of this case show is that the applicant union in fact exercised two of the elements of freedom of association that have been identified as essential, namely, the right for a trade union to seek to persuade the employer to hear what it has to say on behalf of its members, and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The strike by its Hydrex members was part of that exercise, and while it did not achieve its aim, it was not in vain either since it led the company to revise its offer, which the applicant union then commended to its members. Although the Government criticised the applicant union for supporting the revised offer at the time and then reversing its stance in the present proceedings, the Court recognises that the union was bound to respect its members ’ negative vote. Yet the fact that the process of collective bargaining and industrial action, including strike action against the employer of the union members who were the subject of the dispute, did not lead to the outcome desired by the applicant union and its members does not mean that the exercise of their Article 11 rights was illusory. The right to collective bargaining has not been interpreted as including a “right” to a collective agreement (see, in this respect, Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 158, where the Court observed that the absence of any obligation on the authorities to actually enter into a collective agreement was not part of the case). Nor does the right to strike imply a right to prevail. As the Court has often stated, what the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11, to strive for the protection of their members ’ interests ( ibid., § 141, and, more recently Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun” v. Romania [GC], no. 2330/09, § 34, ECHR 2013). This the applicant union and its members involved in the dispute were largely able to do in the present case."

                "86. In previous trade - union cases, the Court has stated that regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. Since achieving a proper balance between the interests of labour and management involves sensitive social and political issues, the Contracting States must be afforded a margin of appreciation as to how trade-union freedom and protection of the occupational interests of union members may be secured. In its most recent restatement of this point the Grand Chamber, referring to the high degree of divergence it observed between the domestic systems in this field, considered that the margin should be a wide one ( see Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133 ). The applicant union relied heavily on Demir and Baykara (cited above, § 119 ) in which the Court considered that the respondent State should be allowed only a limited margin. The Court would point out, however, that the passage in question appears in the part of the judgment examining a very far-reaching interference with freedom of association, one that intruded into its inner core, namely the dissolution of a trade union. It is not to be understood as narrowing decisively and definitively the domestic authorities ’ margin of appreciation in relation to regulating, through normal democratic processes, the exercise of trade - union freedom within the social and economic framework of the country concerned. The breadth of the margin will still depend on the factors that the Court in its case-law has identified as relevant, including the nature and extent of the restriction on the trade - union right in issue, the object pursued by the contested restriction, and the competing rights and interests of other individuals in society who are liable to suffer as a result of the unrestricted exercise of that right. The degree of common ground between the member States of the Council of Europe in relation to the issue arising in the case may also be relevant, as may any international consensus reflected in the apposite international instruments ( see Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 85)."

If a legislative restriction strikes at the core of trade - union activity, a lesser margin of appreciation is to be recognised to the national legislature and more is required to justify the proportionality of the resultant interference, in the general interest, with the exercise of trade - union freedom. Conversely, if it is not the core but a secondary or accessory aspect of trade - union activity that is affected, the margin is wider and the interference is, by its nature, more likely to be proportionate as far as its consequences for the exercise of trade - union freedom are concerned."

As to the nature and extent of the interference suffered in the present case by the applicant union in the exercise of its trade - union freedom, the Court considers that it was not as invasive as the applicant union would have it. What the facts of the case reveal is that it held a strike, albeit on a limited scale and with limited results. It was its wish to escalate the strike, through the threatened or actual involvement of hundreds of its members at Jarvis, another, separate, company not at all involved in the trade dispute in question, that was frustrated. The Court has noted the applicant union ’ s conviction that secondary action would have won the day. Inevitably, that can only be a matter of speculation – including as to the result of any ballot on the subject – since that course of action was clearly ruled out. It cannot be said that the effect of the ban on secondary action struck at the very substance of the applicant union ’ s freedom of association. On this ground the case is to be distinguished from those referred to in paragraph 84 above, which all concerned restrictions on “primary” or direct industrial action by public-sector employees; and the margin of appreciation to be recognised to the national authorities is the wider one available in relation to the regulation, in the public interest, of the secondary aspects of trade - union activity."

                "89. As for the object of the interference in issue in the present case, the extracts from the debates in Parliament preceding the passage of the Employment Act 1980 make clear the legislative intention to strike a new balance in industrial relations, in the interests of the broader economy, by curbing what was a very broad right to take secondary action. A decade later, the government of the day considered that even in its more limited form secondary action posed a threat to the economy and to inward investment in the country ’ s economic activity. As a matter of policy it considered that restricting industrial action to primary strikes would achieve a more acceptable balance within the British economy. The Government have reiterated that position in the present proceedings. That assessment was sharply contested at the time by the opposition in Parliament, and is rejected by the applicant union as grounded in animus towards trade unions rather than any clear evidence of direct damage to the economy. Yet the subject matter in this case is certainly related to the social and economic strategy of the respondent State. In this regard the Court has usually allowed a wide margin of appreciation since, by virtue of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities, and in particular the democratically elected Parliaments, are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds and which legislative measures are best suited for the conditions in their country in order to implement the chosen social, economic or industrial policy (see, among many authorities, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 89, ECHR 2011 )."

The comparative information adduced before the Court reveals a spectrum of national positions, ranging from a broadly permissive stance in countries such as Greece, Finland, Norway and Sweden, to those that do not recognise or permit it. The other States mentioned above ( see paragraphs 38-41) are located between these two outer points. The Government played down the significance of the comparative perspective, emphasising the deep structural and cultural differences among European States in the field of industrial relations. The Court acknowledges that diversity, which it has recognised in other cases concerning the rights of trade unions ( see, for example, Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133, and Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, § 58, ECHR 2006 ‑ I). It is nevertheless clear that, with its outright ban on secondary action, the respondent State stands at one end of the comparative spectrum, being one of a small group of European States to adopt such a categorical stance on the matter. The varied comparative picture, and the position of the United Kingdom within it, do not in themselves, however, mean that the domestic authorities have overstepped their legitimate margin of appreciation in regulating this aspect of trade - union activity."

The United Kingdom banned secondary action more than two decades ago and throughout this time has been subject to critical comments by the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. The applicant union prayed these materials in aid. The Government did not consider the particular criticisms made to be relevant to the factual situation denounced in the present case, or otherwise significant. The Court will now examine this point."

Its role was to report to the Committee of Ministers. The Court observes that the ECSR ’ s competence is stipulated in the Protocol amending the European Social Charter (also known as the “Turin Protocol”, Council of Europe Treaty Series No. 142), namely to “assess from a legal standpoint the compliance of national law and practice with the obligations arising from the Charter”. It is true that this Protocol has not come into force as several States Parties to the Charter, including the United Kingdom, have not ratified it. Yet the interpretative value of the ECSR appears to be generally accepted by States and by the Committee of Ministers. It is certainly accepted by the Court, which has repeatedly had regard to the ECSR ’ s interpretation of the Charter and its assessment of State compliance with its various provisions ( see, for example, Demir and Baykara, cited above; see also Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar v.

Its role is not to endorse the conclusions of the ECSR. Secondly, the Court notes that the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter has taken a first step in the direction of a Committee of Ministers ’ recommendation on the issue of secondary action, by adopting a warning to the United Kingdom that “urged the Government to take all adequate steps to bring the situation into conformity with the Charter” (see its Report concerning Conclusions XIX-3 (2010), T- SG( 2012)1 _ final, at p. 59)."

With respect to the ILO Committee of Experts, the Government made a similar observation – that body was not formally competent to give authoritative interpretations to ILO Conventions. It drew the Court ’ s attention to an ongoing disagreement within the ILO precisely regarding the legal status or even existence of a right to strike. The Committee of Experts had recently recognised the limits of its role, stating that “[its] opinions and recommendations are not binding within the ILO supervisory process and are not binding outside the ILO unless an international instrument expressly establishes them as such or the Supreme Court of a country so decides of its own volition” (from the foreword to “ Collective Bargaining in the Public Service: A way forward ”, a report of the ILO Committee of Experts to the 102nd session of the International Labour Conference, 2013). This text goes on to describe the Committee of Expert ’ s interpretations as “soft law”. The foreword concludes (§ 8):",
                "“As regards the interpretation of ILO Conventions and the role of the International Court of Justice in this area, the Committee has pointed out since 1990 that its terms of reference do not enable it to give definitive interpretations of Conventions, competence to do so being vested in the International Court of Justice by article 37 of the Constitution of the ILO. It has stated, nevertheless, that in order to carry out its function of determining whether the requirements of Conventions are being respected, the Committee has to consider the content and meaning of the provisions of Conventions, to determine their legal scope, and where appropriate to express its views on these matters. The Committee has consequently considered that, in so far as its views are not contradicted by the International Court of Justice, they should be considered as valid and generally recognized. The Committee considers the acceptance of these considerations to be indispensable to maintaining the principle of legality and, consequently, to the certainty of law required for the proper functioning of the International Labour Organization.”"

The Court does not consider that this clarification requires it to reconsider this body ’ s role as a point of reference and guidance for the interpretation of certain provisions of the Convention (see, more generally, Demir and Baykara, cited above, §§ 65-86). While the Government referred to disagreements voiced at the 101 st International Labour Conference, 2012, it appears from the records of that meeting that the disagreement originated with and was confined to the employer group (Provisional Record of the 101 st Session of the International Labour Conference, No. 19 (Rev.), §§ 82 ‑ 90). The governments who took the floor during that discussion were reported as saying that the right to strike was “well established and widely accepted as a fundamental right”. The representative of the government of Norway added that her country fully accepted the Committee of Experts ’ interpretation that the right to strike was protected under Convention No. 87. In any event, the respondent Government accepted in the present proceedings that the right afforded under Article 11 to join a trade union normally implied the ability to strike (see paragraph 62 above)."

The foregoing analysis of the interpretative opinions emitted by the competent bodies set up under the most relevant international instruments mirrors the conclusion reached on the comparative material before the Court, to wit that with its outright ban on secondary industrial action, the respondent State finds itself at the most restrictive end of a spectrum of national regulatory approaches on this point and is out of line with a discernible international trend calling for a less restrictive approach. The significance that such a conclusion may have for the Court ’ s assessment in a given case was explained in Demir and Baykara ( cited above, § 85) in the following terms :",
                "“ ... The consensus emerging from specialised international instruments and from the practice of Contracting States may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases.”",
                "The Grand Chamber ’ s statement reflects the distinct character of the Court ’ s review compared with that of the supervisory procedures of the ILO and the European Social Charter. The specialised international monitoring bodies operating under those procedures have a different standpoint, shown in the more general terms used to analyse the ban on secondary action (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above). In contrast, it is not the Court ’ s task to review the relevant domestic law in the abstract, but to determine whether the manner in which it actually affected the applicant infringed the latter ’ s rights under Article 11 of the Convention (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 116, ECHR 2012; see also Kart v. Turkey [GC], no. 8917/05, §§ 85-87, ECHR 2009 ). The applicant union as well as the third parties dwelt on the possible effect of the ban in various hypothetical scenarios, which could go as far as to exclude any form of industrial action at all if the workers directly concerned were not in a position to take primary action, thereby, unlike in the present case, striking at the very substance of trade - union freedom. They also considered that the ban could make it easy for employers to exploit the law to their advantage through resort to various legal stratagems, such as delocalising work centres, outsourcing work to other companies and adopting complex corporate structures in order to transfer work to separate legal entities or to hive off companies. In short, trade unions could find themselves severely hampered in the performance of their legitimate, normal activities in protecting their members ’ interests. These alleged, far-reaching negative effects of the statutory ban do not, however, arise in the situation at Hydrex. The Court ’ s review is bounded by the facts submitted for examination in the case. This being so, the Court considers that the negative assessments made by the relevant monitoring bodies of the ILO and European Social Charter are not of such persuasive weight for determining whether the operation of the statutory ban on secondary strikes in circumstances such as those complained of in the present case remained within the range of permissible options open to the national authorities under Article 11 of the Convention."

The domestic authorities ’ power of appreciation is not unlimited, however, but goes hand in hand with European supervision, it being the Court ’ s task to give a final ruling on whether a particular restriction is reconcilable with freedom of association as protected by Article 11 ( see Vörður Ólafsson v. Iceland, no. 20161/06, § 76, ECHR 2010 ). The Government have argued that the “pressing social need” for maintaining the statutory ban on secondary strikes is to shield the domestic economy from the disruptive effects of such industrial action, which, if permitted, would pose a risk to the country ’ s economic recovery. In the sphere of social and economic policy, which must be taken to include a country ’ s industrial - relations policy, the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010). Moreover, the Court has recognised the “special weight” to be accorded to the role of the domestic policy-maker in matters of general policy on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely (see, in the context of Article 10 of the Convention, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, § 200, 18 January 2011, referring in turn to Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII, where the Court adverted to the “direct democratic legitimation” that the legislature enjoys). The ban on secondary action has remained intact for over twenty years, notwithstanding two changes of government during that time. This denotes a democratic consensus in support of it, and an acceptance of the reasons for it, which span a broad spectrum of political opinion in the United Kingdom. These considerations lead the Court to conclude that in their assessment of how the broader public interest is best served in their country in the often charged political, social and economic context of industrial relations, the domestic legislative authorities relied on reasons that were both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 11."

As it has recently stated, a State may, consistently with the Convention, adopt general legislative measures applying to predefined situations without providing for individualised assessments with regard to the individual, necessarily differing and perhaps complex circumstances of each single case governed by the legislation (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 107, ECHR 2013, with many further references concerning different provisions of the Convention and Protocol No. 1 ). That does not mean the specific facts of the individual case are without significance for the Court ’ s analysis of proportionality. Indeed, they evidence the impact in practice of the general measure and are thus material to its proportionality ( ibid., § 108).

In this respect, the applicant union has argued that it would have limited its action to a secondary strike at Jarvis, with no further spill-over effects. That can only be a matter of speculation however. As the materials in the case file show, the very reason that caused Parliament to curb the broad scope for secondary action was its capacity, pre-1980, to spread far and fast beyond the original industrial dispute. It is to that situation that, according to the applicant union, the United Kingdom should return if it is to conform to the requirements of Article 11."

In this regard it is relevant to note that for a period of ten years, 1980-90, the United Kingdom found it possible to operate with a lighter restriction on secondary action (see paragraphs 23-24 above). The Government have not argued that this legislative regime was attended by the difficulties referred to above, or that this was why the ban was introduced. The applicant union did not comment in detail on the legal position during that period. It took the view that the question of its compatibility with the Convention was “of entirely academic interest”, though added that were the point relevant it would argue such a restriction would not be acceptable. The Court observes that, although the legislative history of the United Kingdom points to the existence of conceivable alternatives to the ban, that is not determinative of the matter. For the question is not whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or whether the State can establish that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved. It is rather whether, in adopting the general measure it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it ( see Animal Defenders, cited above, § 110) – which, for the reasons developed above, the Court has found to be a broad one – and whether, overall, a fair balance was struck. Although the applicant union has adduced cogent arguments of trade - union solidarity and efficacy, these have not persuaded the Court that the United Kingdom Parliament lacked sufficient policy and factual reasons to consider the impugned ban on secondary industrial action as being “ necessary in a democratic society”."

Thus slogans calling for the Government’s resignation are in complete contradiction to that code ... I am telling you, it will not be possible for excesses like the ones at that meeting to reoccur in the future. This is what I guarantee to you.

They had been made in reaction to excessive and inappropriate views expressed at the public meeting, such as calls for the Government to step down and indication that police officers might be paid by the mafia. No specific action had been taken in respect of the first, second or fourth applicants.",

It safeguards freedom to protect the occupational interests of trade union members by trade union action, the conduct and development of which the Contracting States must both permit and make possible. A trade union must thus be free to strive for the protection of its members’ interests and the individual members have the right that the trade union be heard in order to protect those interests. Article 11 does not, however, require any particular treatment of trade unions or their members and leaves each State a free choice of the means to be used to secure their right to be heard."
