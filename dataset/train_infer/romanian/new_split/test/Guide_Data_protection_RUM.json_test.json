                "93. The Court reiterates that personal information relating to a patient belongs to his or her private life (see, for example, I. v. Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 34, 25 November 2008; Ion Cârstea v. Romania, no. 20531/06, § 33, 28 October 2014; Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 191, ECHR 2016) as well as moral integrity (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 83, ECHR 2015 (extracts)) falls under Article 8 of the Convention. Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis. Disclosure of such information falls therefore within the ambit of Article 8 (see, more recently, Surikov v. Ukraine, no. 42788/06, § 75, 26 January 2017)."

The Court thus previously found that the disclosure – without a patient’s consent – of medical records containing highly personal and sensitive data about a patient, including information relating to an abortion, by a clinic to the Social Insurance Office, and therefore to a wider circle of public servants, constituted an interference with the patient’s right to respect for private life (see M.S. v. Sweden, 27 August 1997, § 35, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 44, 25 November 2008, also see Fürst-Pfeifer v. Austria, nos. 33677/10 and 52340/10, § 43, 17 May 2016; Avilkina and Others v.

At her parents’ request and once her health had improved, in summer 1992 she continued treatment at a psychiatric institution in Šiauliai ( Šiaulių psichoneurologijos dispanseris ), where her diagnosis was acute paranoid psychosis ( ūmi paranoidinė psichozė ).

In particular, she had not been able to communicate well and had spoken only about religion-related topics while at the hospital. Subsequently, the applicant received treatment in the same psychiatric institution in Šiauliai in 1994, when she was diagnosed with paranoia ( paranoidinė būsena ). She was disorientated and depressed. The doctors noted that the applicant had an inner conflict – she was dissatisfied with the hyper care ( hipergloba ) given to her by her mother, but was nevertheless not independent or mentally mature. In the summer of 1996 the applicant was again admitted to hospital and treated in the psychiatric institution in Šiauliai, where she was diagnosed with moderately severe endogenous depression ( endogeninė depresija, vidutinio gilumo ).

On the basis of the forensic expert report and other material, the Vilnius Regional Court firstly observed that the applicant had not actually denied that she might have required medical assistance on 7 May 2003 because of her state of mind. However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”. Also, at 8.30 a.m. on the same day, doctor A.G., the other psychiatrist treating her at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, had written that “currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear, she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacientė š.m. mieguista dėl vaistų poveikio, sąmonė aiški, orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli... šiuo metu afektas lygus )”. The court also based itself on the applicant’s other medical records. All that meant that the applicant’s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in Article 27 of the Law on Mental Health Care to permit her further forced hospitalisation. Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order.

The Vilnius Regional Court also observed that there was no written evidence that the applicant had ever agreed to be placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital between 7 May and 26 June 2003. According to the forensic expert report, the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on 7 May 2003; however, the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period between 8 May and 26 June 2003. That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

That had led to the applicant being taken to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The mother also said she had contacted the Ojas Meditation Centre in Vilnius about her daughter, but had not received a constructive response. She had then contacted the journalists from Srovės, because she had wished to find out what was happening to her daughter.

The court found valid the applicant’s complaints that the doctors had tried to dissuade ( atkalbėti ) her from meditating, attempted to alter her views on non-traditional meditation religion and had treated her against meditating and attending the Ojas Meditation Centre. That conclusion was based on the applicant’s medical file, which contained the following records for 26 May and 20 and 23 June 2003: “ ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the Ojas Meditation] Centre”; “during psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the Ojas Centre, argues, that ‘it is a personal matter’”; “when efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude ( suformuoti kritiką ) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical”. The first-instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non-traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger. The court thus concluded that “by attempting to alter the applicant’s attitude to non-traditional religion, meditation, and their practice at the Ojas Meditation Centre” the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion. Lastly, the court rejected as legally irrelevant the hospital’s assertion that at the time of the applicant’s admission to hospital the meditation centre had been operating “unlawfully”. The Vilnius Regional Court observed that the religious movement had been a party to court proceedings for its registration at the time and had been registered on 12 April 2005.",

The doctor had merely given an opinion about an unidentified person. Moreover, the doctor had pointed out during the first ‑ instance hearings that she had only given her views when answering the questions the journalists had put to her. Three witnesses – the applicant’s mother, sister and the journalist R.S. – had explained during the first ‑ instance court’s hearings that the television programme had been initiated by the applicant’s relatives, who had provided information about the applicant.

The hospital also relied on a 29 August 2003 statement by the Ministry of Justice that Osho movement centres did not have the status of a religion (see paragraph 55 below), which supported the hospital’s view that meditation was not a religious practice.

Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8 May had been indispensable. It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours.

In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos herojė ) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant.

In its ensuing report, published on 4 June 2014, and as regards Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the CPT noted:",
                "“ C. Psychiatric establishments",
                "89. In the course of the 2012 visit, the CPT visited for the first time Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. The visit was of a targeted nature, focusing on the application of means of restraint and the implementation in practice of legal safeguards for involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients.",
                "90. Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital is the largest psychiatric institution in Lithuania, with an official capacity of 619 beds (distributed among fourteen in-patient units, both locked and open). At the time of the delegation’s visit, the establishment was accommodating 394 civil patients. Of them, seven had been placed there on an involuntary basis pursuant to [Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care]. The delegation was told that the average stay in the Hospital lasted 23 days.",
                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

                "79. The Government firstly claimed that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v.

The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists.

The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies. Prior to the broadcast she had not made any information public about her mental state or former ailments."

As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 34, 25 November 2008; Ion Cârstea v. Romania, no. 20531/06, § 33, 28 October 2014; Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 83, ECHR 2015 (extracts)) falls under Article 8 of the Convention. Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis. Disclosure of such information falls therefore within the ambit of Article 8 (see, more recently, Surikov v. Ukraine, no. 42788/06, § 75, 26 January 2017)."

The Court thus previously found that the disclosure – without a patient’s consent – of medical records containing highly personal and sensitive data about a patient, including information relating to an abortion, by a clinic to the Social Insurance Office, and therefore to a wider circle of public servants, constituted an interference with the patient’s right to respect for private life (see M.S. v. Sweden, 27 August 1997, § 35, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 44, 25 November 2008, also see Fürst-Pfeifer v. Austria, nos. 33677/10 and 52340/10, § 43, 17 May 2016; Avilkina and Others v.

The Court firstly notes that the applicant’s grievance directly relates only to the actions of Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital and the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. in particular, whom the applicant saw as primarily responsible for the breach of her privacy and against whom she pursued court proceedings for damages at the domestic level (see paragraphs 24, 43 and 81 above). That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srovės broadcast of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists’ actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srovės programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant’s complaint.",

                "97. Although some of the circumstances of this case are not entirely clear, it transpires from the record of the Vilnius Regional Court’s hearing that after the applicant had been admitted to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital without her consent on 7 May 2003, her mother contacted the Srovės journalists and told them where the applicant was being held, but that she did not know her daughter’s diagnosis (see paragraph 33 above). For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29).

Therefore, even if Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital personnel had not prohibited the applicant from meditating, she had been encouraged to do that in line with the state of her health.

The Government also noted that according to the experts the applicant had had a transitory psychotic disorder from 8 May 2003 until 26 June 2003 (see paragraph 18 above), and it was not for the Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts (the Government relied on Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, § 66, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII, and Donohoe v. Ireland, no. 19165/08, § 73, 12 December 2013). Even though the domestic courts had confirmed the illegality of the applicant’s stay at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the applicant’s claim of allegedly improper medical treatment had been rejected by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 51 above). In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here. In the instant case, the psycho-correction methods applied by the psychiatrists had been used in order “to form a critical, not a negative, attitude towards religion” (emphasised by the Government)."

The Court reiterates that freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as enshrined in Article 9, is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A, and Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on freedom of thought, conscience and religion in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and the case-law cited therein). The Court has also held that the State enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, § 76, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI; also see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 123, ECHR 2011).

Greece, no. 19516/06, § 38, 21 February 2008, and Grzelak v. Poland, no. 7710/02, § 87, 15 June 2010). Consequently, State authorities are not entitled to intervene in the sphere of an individual’s freedom of conscience and to seek to discover his or her religious beliefs or oblige him or her to disclose such beliefs (see Alexandridis, cited above, § 38, and Sinan Işık v. Turkey, no. 21924/05, § 41, ECHR 2010). The Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova v.

The Court firstly notes that the Government did acknowledge that the right to practise one’s religion in accordance with the Osho teaching fell within the scope of Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above). The Court has no reason to hold otherwise, all the more so since pursuant to the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision the Ojas Meditation Center had been registered as a religious community (see paragraph 56 above; also see İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 68, ECHR 2016). Indeed, and although a State actor – Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital – during the domestic court proceedings in the applicant’s case prayed in aid that the lack of recognition of the Osho movement as religion in Lithuania in 2003 deprived individual adherents of that religion of the protection of Article 9, the Court cannot share such a suggestion (see paragraphs 25, 42 and 98 above). To hold so would mean that the State could exclude certain beliefs by withholding recognition. The Court has already held that punishing those who manifest religious beliefs which have not been recognised by the State constitutes a violation of Article 9 (see Masaev v. Moldova, no. 6303/05, § 26, 12 May 2009)."

The Court has regard to the applicant’s claims about interference with her right to practise Osho teaching whilst being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, those allegations having been supported by the first instance court’s findings (see paragraph 37 above). The applicant’s claims were however contested by the Government, which, in turn, relied on the conclusions by the Court of Appeal and asserted that the applicant had been able to practise her religion during her stay at that institution (see paragraph 50 above). The Court therefore finds that it has been presented with diverging accounts of the applicant’s factual situation in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The Court points out that in principle it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts (see Kyriacou Tsiakkourmas and Others v. Turkey, no. 13320/02, § 165, 2 June 2015, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015). Even so, the Court has already held that, in a situation like this, it remains free to itself evaluate the facts in the light of all the material at its disposal (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 32, Series A no. 336, and Alexandridis, cited above, § 34; also see Klimov v. Russia, no. 54436/14, § 64, 4 October 2016; Idalov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 41858/08, § 99 in fine, 13 December 2016).

                "123. Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

            [
                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

                "128. In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."

            [
                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

Biriuk, or that the information about the husband ’ s state of health, indicating his full name and residence, had been made public with his consent, or met a legitimate public interest in drawing society ’ s attention to the rising number of HIV cases in Lithuania.

The article humiliated the husband and the publication of information about his private life caused him non-pecuniary damage, had an impact on his health, and a negative influence on his family life and his reputation. It also restricted his family ’ s opportunities to communicate with others. The court noted that in 2001 the statutory capital of the newspaper company - JSC Lietuvos Rytas - was LTL 33,754,700 (approximately EUR 9,776,037). However, the court concluded that the information had not been made public deliberately, and applied Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public.

The Court recalls that, in certain circumstances, it has struck out of its list cases where it has taken the view that the nature of the complaint did not allow it to be transferred to a relative because it was so closely linked to the person of the deceased that the heirs could not claim to have a sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the application ( see X v. France, judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234 ‑ C, p. 11, § 26). However, in the present case the Court considers that the close relatives of Laimutis Armonas, in particular his spouse and their minor child, have an interest of their own to ensure that his right to privacy is respected even if he died before the final domestic decision, as any statement violating this right not only affected the deceased ’ s reputation but also that of his family (see, mutatis mutandis, Nölkenbockhoff v. Germany, decision of 12 December 198 4, D.R. 40, p. 187, § 4). The Court particularly notes the conclusion of the Vilnius City Third District Court that the article in question restricted the family ’ s opportunities to communicate with others (paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the family had had to leave their village because of the adverse effects of the newspaper article on their relations with their neighbours (paragraph 2 6 above). Consequently, the Court is of the opinion that the link between the publication and the deceased is not exclusive and it cannot be claimed that the article had no bearing at all on the person of the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256 ‑ A, p. 25). In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant has standing to bring the present proceedings in her husband ’ s stead."

                "30. The Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the husband could not have claimed to be a victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as the domestic courts had clearly established a violation of his right to respect for private life and had awarded appropriate compensation. However, the Court emphasises that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of the status of a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III, § 36). The Court recognises that the domestic courts determined the violation of the husband ’ s right to private and family life. However, the Court finds that the question of victim status as regards the redress for this violation is inextricably linked to the merits of the complaint. Therefore, it considers that both questions should be joined and examined together. The Court also observes that the applicant ’ s complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that the complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible."

Under Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the Republic of Lithuania had failed to fulfil its positive obligation to secure respect for her family ’ s private life. Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public was inadequate from the point of view of Article 8 of the Convention, as it limited the amount of non-pecuniary damages to LTL 10,000 for an unintentional breach of privacy. Taking into account the financial strength of the newspaper, the existence of such a low limit was conducive towards the violation of her husband ’ s rights, as it was aware that under no circumstances would it be required to pay large sums in compensation for breaches of this kind. The applicant concluded that this statutory limit could not be deemed a necessary and proportionate means to achieve any of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 8 § 2 of the Convention.",

The Government noted that Article 8 does not necessarily require the State to fulfil its positive obligation to secure respect for the private life of a person by the provision of unlimited compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in determining the measures required for the better implementation of that obligation, as long as the limits on such compensation reasonably correspond to the social importance of the protected values and certain financial standards based on the economic situation of the country. In the Government ’ s view, when seeking a fair balance between the general interest of the country and the interests of the individual, setting a maximum amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage within a certain period of a State ’ s life should be acceptable."

The Court has previously held that the notion of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention is a broad concept which includes, inter alia, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings (see Niemietz v. Germany, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251 ‑ B, p. 33, § 29). It encompasses elements such as sexual life (see, for example, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 18-19, § 41 ) and, undoubtedly, personal information relating to a patient (see I. v.

The Court recalls that, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in the effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure the right even in the sphere of the relations between individuals (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, § 75, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... )."

The Court has previously held that whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant ’ s rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8, or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole ( see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI ). Furthermore, in striking this balance, the aims mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 8 may be of a certain relevance (see Rees v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, § 37)."

In view of the diversity of the practices followed and the situations obtaining in the Contracting States, the notion ’ s requirements will vary considerably from case to case. Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting Parties enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention, account being taken of the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, § 55). The Court nonetheless recalls that Article 8, like any other provision of the Convention or its Protocols, must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Shevanova v. Latvia, no. 58822/00, § 69, 15 June 2006)."

However, the Court notes that a fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts – even if controversial – capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society and making tawdry allegations about an individual ’ s private life (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v. Germany, cited above, § 63 ). As to respect for the individual ’ s private life, the Court reiterates the fundamental importance of its protection in order to ensure the development of every human being ’ s personality.

The above considerations are especially valid as regards the protection of the confidentiality of a person ’ s HIV status (cf. Council of Europe materials, paragraphs 2 0 -2 1 above). The disclosure of such data may dramatically affect his or her private and family life, as well as the individual ’ s social and employment situation, by exposing that person to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v.

The Court takes particular note of the fact that the family lived not in a city but in a village, which increased the impact of the publication on the possibility that the husband ’ s illness would be known by his neighbours and his immediate family, thereby causing public humiliation and exclusion from village social life. In this respect the Court sees no reason to depart from the conclusion of the national courts, which acknowledged that there had been interference with the family ’ s right to privacy."

However, the Court sees no such legitimate interest and agrees with the finding of the Vilnius City Third District Court, which held that making public information about the husband ’ s state of health, indicating his full name, surname and residence, did not correspond to any legitimate public interest (paragraph 8 above). In the Court ’ s view, the publication of the article in question, the sole purpose of which was apparently to satisfy the prurient curiosity of a particular readership, cannot be deemed to contribute to any debate of general interest to society (see, among many authorities, Prisma Presse v. France (dec.), nos. 66910/01 and 71612/01, 1 July 2003). Consequently, given that the balance lay in favour of the individual ’ s right to privacy, the State had an obligation to ensure that the husband was able effectively to enforce that right against the press."

It cannot be denied that publication of such information in the biggest national daily newspaper could have a negative impact on the willingness of others to take voluntary tests for HIV ( cf. paragraph 2 1 above ). In this context, it is of special importance that domestic law provides appropriate safeguards to discourage any such disclosures and the further publication of personal data."

It has regard to the existence of the judicial guidelines to be followed if the right to privacy of a person has been breached (see paragraphs 1 2 - 19 above). The Court also notes that the domestic courts indeed awarded the husband compensation for non-pecuniary damage. However the principal issue is whether the award of LTL 10,000 was proportionate to the damage he sustained and whether the State, in adopting Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, which limited the amount of such compensation payable by the mass media, fulfilled its positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention."

The Court also acknowledges that certain financial standards based on the economic situation of the State are to be taken into account when determining the measures required for the better implementation of the foregoing obligation. The Court likewise takes note of the fact that the Member States of the Council of Europe may regulate questions of compensation for non-pecuniary damage differently, as well as the fact that the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State ’ s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention. However, such limits must not be such as to deprive the individual of his or her privacy and thereby empty the right of its effective content."

Regarding the legitimate aim, the Court observes that the applicant had been suspected of corruption-related activity – giving better conditions, as well as incentives, to inmates – for personal gain. Such actions, which could have led to inmates being released before they had reformed, demonstrated a danger to society (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). In this context the Court notes the domestic courts’ finding that such activity, which the applicant was suspected of, and which was not entirely without basis (see paragraph 31 above), could have placed people outside the prison walls in danger (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, as pointed out by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, the applicant’s actions discredited the system of the execution of sentences, and were damaging to society’s trust in public service (see paragraph 39 above). Likewise, as emphasised by the Supreme Administrative Court, the use of information gathered during the secret surveillance against the applicant served the purpose of guaranteeing the transparency and openness of public service, and sought to ensure that the aims of statutory institutions were not ignored (see paragraph 43 above). Prevention of acts of a corrupt nature and transparency and openness of State service have also been listed among legitimate aims by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above).

On 4 August 2017 that complaint was dismissed by the Prosecutor General’s Office. The prosecutor noted that he had obtained and examined the materials in the criminal investigation file. As noted by the prosecutor, given that some of the documents, or parts of the documents, in that file had been marked as “restricted use”, in the decision he would refer only to information which was either not classified or which had been declassified. The prosecutor thus referred to a number of particular documents of 2015 and 2016, such as requests for the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications, lodged by the Department of Prisons and the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the authorising decisions by the Vilnius Regional Court. The prosecutor observed that, prior to authorising the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications, other methods had been used to try to establish possible criminal acts: information had been collected about the inmates and other persons with whom the applicant maintained contact, and about incentives and other privileges awarded to inmates. On the facts it had been found that, by calling the applicant from unlawfully owned mobile telephones, the inmates would not only solve their own issues, but also act as intermediaries to solve other inmates’ problems. The applicant would meet the inmates’ relatives in his office at Kybartai prison or in secret locations in town. Although the applicant contended that the criminal intelligence investigation had been opened in connection with his unlawful actions in organising internal competitions, in reality it had been commenced on the basis of information about the applicant awarding incentives to inmates in exchange for remuneration."

The prosecutor also considered that the information gathered during the criminal intelligence investigation had been (lawfully) used to examine the applicant’s disciplinary offences or misconduct in office, in compliance with the requirements of the Law on Criminal Intelligence."

By a ruling of 4 September 2017 ordering the Department of Prisons to provide it with the criminal intelligence materials, and, afterwards, by a ruling of 25 September 2017, adopted in written proceedings, notwithstanding the applicant’s request that a hearing be held, the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the prosecutor’s decision. The court pointed out that, under Article 5 § 9 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, a person had a right to challenge criminal intelligence measures, should he or she consider that those measures had breached his or her rights (see paragraph 47 below). Such complaints were amenable to appeal at two stages – an appeal could be made to the prosecutor and then to the court. The court also observed that the applicant had not explained which particular freedoms or rights had been breached by the criminal intelligence measures. Even so, it appeared from the applicant’s arguments that the complaint was linked to his dismissal from work. For the court, in the proceedings at hand it had jurisdiction to examine only questions relating to the duration of the criminal intelligence measures and their proportionality. Any arguments regarding whether information obtained by employing criminal intelligence measures could be used when examining disciplinary offences should be examined in different court proceedings regarding that disciplinary offence."

                "21. On the merits, the Vilnius Regional Court specified that on 20 May 2015 the Department of Prisons had received information about the applicant providing better living conditions for inmates in exchange for payment, and also awarding them incentives. That information had contained elements of the crime of abuse of office. It had included details of one particular inmate who had been given better conditions and incentives; that information had already been known about before the opening of the criminal intelligence investigation. Once the investigation had been opened, but before the authorisation of the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications, information about disciplinary penalties and incentives in respect of the inmates had been received, and that information supported the suspicions against the applicant. A criminal intelligence measure – the interception of the applicant’s electronic communications – had then been authorised by the court. That authorisation had been extended several times by the court, the interception lasting for twelve months altogether, that being the maximum term allowed under the Law on Criminal Intelligence. Accordingly, neither the time-limit for the above-mentioned measure, nor the rules for its authorisation – by a court decision – had been breached. The court noted that “it had acquainted itself with the criminal intelligence investigation file”. The criminal intelligence investigation had been intensive, information had not only been gathered by intercepting the applicant’s telephone communications, and the new information obtained was being verified in various ways, and would prove to be true. The Vilnius Regional Court also specifically noted that during the first three-month period when the technical measures had been applied, “another event” ( kitas įvykis ), having the features of the crime of abuse of office, had been established. That “new event” had been referred to in the prosecutor’s request to the court to extend the interception measure. Similarly, during the first and the second extensions, the Department of Prisons had referred to “new concrete events”, and that information had likewise been relied on by the prosecutor when asking to extend the authorisation of the interception. There had not been a single extension in respect of which there had been no new information received about the applicant’s possible criminal acts (see also paragraph 8 above). It was understandable that at the time when the criminal intelligence investigation started and the interception had been authorised, there had not been much information about the possible unlawful activity; however, with each extension of the interception period, the amount of such information should have become greater, which had been the case."

                "22. Given the applicant’s place of work and his position – he was the director of a prison – the interception of his electronic communications had been a proportionate measure. Specifically, the State and society had an interest in having inmates following the letter of the law. The information which had prompted the criminal investigation showed that the applicant used to award unwarranted incentives to the inmates, thus portraying them positively, without merit. Those actions by the applicant posed a clear and present danger to society, as those inmates could use the incentives in order to be released from prison early. Furthermore, the applicant’s work in an inaccessible and protected incarceration facility had significantly restricted the means for the criminal intelligence investigation, which made recourse to such technical means as interception of the applicant’s electronic communications reasonable and proportionate. The applicant’s actions had elements of corruption-related criminal acts, and uncovering such crimes was always complicated on account of the perpetrators’ conspiratorial tendencies, their interest in not being detected, and, in this particular case, the applicant’s specific knowledge of criminal intelligence means and methods, and his knowledge of how to counter them."

It has ... been mentioned that, under the Constitution, ... a court (judge), when administering justice and settling a dispute concerning the imposition of an official penalty, must, on a case-by-case basis, fully assess all the material, data, or information used in investigating the misconduct in office, and must decide whether, inter alia, information about a person that has been collected secretly in the manner established by law, declassified in accordance with the procedure laid down in legal acts, and transmitted for use for the purposes of the investigation of the misconduct in office by the person in question, can be considered evidence in a concrete case, whether such information complies with requirements for the lawfulness and credibility of evidence, and whether such use is necessary in a democratic society when the State seeks to attain certain legitimate aims, such as to ensure the transparency and openness of State service, as well as to prevent corruption and acts of a corrupt nature in State service; the court (judge) must also assess, in each case, whether the use of the information in question for the purposes of investigating misconduct in office of a corrupt nature is in line with the principle of proportionality, and whether the said legitimate aims could be achieved in a particular case by other less restrictive means.",

As mentioned above, under the Constitution, a person must be afforded effective protection against the possible arbitrariness of public authorities, namely an opportunity to apply to a court and to lodge an appeal against the lawfulness, reasonableness, and proportionality of the collection of the criminal intelligence in question about him or her and of the transmission of that information under Paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence for the purposes of investigating misconduct in office of a corrupt nature.”"

This was a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society in order to achieve the objective of official liability in accordance with the Constitution, that is, to create preconditions for the proper application of official liability as a public form of control over servants or officials of a democratic State and for their accountability to society, for acts that were incompatible with the requirements, arising from the Constitution, of State service as a system and for State servants or officials.

Likewise, even if the Government argued that the applicant had received some or all of those previously classified documents, the fact remains that the court proceedings regarding the disciplinary penalties ended by a final court decision only on 29 April 2021, and it was only in those proceedings that the court examined the applicant’s grievances regarding the lawfulness and proportionality of the use of those documents during the disciplinary proceedings.

With regard to this point, the Court refers to Article 5 § 9 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, which sets out two levels of appeal against such actions (see paragraph 47 above), this fact also having been noted by the domestic court (see paragraph 20 above). Accordingly, in the instant case the applicant put his grievances to the prosecutor, who examined his complaint and gave detailed answers, and afterwards to a court (see paragraphs 18-23 above). As it appears from the documents in the Court’s possession, before reaching his decision the prosecutor had obtained the criminal investigation file; even so, the prosecutor would only rely on the materials which were not classified (see paragraph 18 above)."

                "68. The applicant’s appeal against the prosecutor’s decision was then examined by the Vilnius Regional Court, which gave detailed and specific reasons why it had been lawful and proportionate to use criminal intelligence measures against the applicant. Before reaching its verdict, the Vilnius Regional Court had ordered the Department of Prisons to provide it with the criminal intelligence materials (see paragraph 20 in limine above). As the court decision of 25 September 2017 reads, the Vilnius Regional Court entered into the merits of the applicant’s complaint concerning the lawfulness and proportionality of the use of the criminal intelligence measures (see, in particular, paragraph 21 above; contrast, mutatis mutandis, Prebil, cited above, § 44). This aspect was later pointed out by the administrative court, which also held that there had been no basis on which to hold that the authorities’ actions would have been in breach of the law (see paragraph 38 above). Given the documents previously made available to the applicant (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above; see also paragraph 24 above), the Court considers that he was able to formulate his claims to the necessary extent (contrast Pocius, cited above, §§ 51, 54 and 56). Even assuming that at the stage of the proceedings before the Vilnius Regional Court the applicant had not yet had access to all the criminal intelligence materials – a circumstance which in any case was remedied by the applicant having access to those materials at a later stage (see paragraph 70 below) -, the Court observes that the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right. In any court proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to keep secret certain police methods of investigation, which must be weighed against the rights of the defence (see Pocius, cited above, §§ 52 and 53), this having clearly been the situation in the case at hand. On the effectiveness of review, the Court has stated that a reviewing authority must be able to verify whether contested measures have been lawfully ordered and executed. In the case of retrospective review of the lawfulness of a surveillance measure, the applicant must, at the very least, be provided with sufficient information regarding the existence of an authorisation and the minimum level of information about the decision authorising secret surveillance (see Šantare and Labazņikovs v. Latvia, no. 34148/07, § 55, 31 March 2016, and the case-law cited therein). On the facts of this case, the Court finds that such information was provided to the applicant. The Court also does not lose sight of the legal rule that certain materials, such as those relating to the participants in the criminal investigation measures, may not be disclosed to individuals by law (see paragraph 47 above), this aspect having been underscored both by the Department of Prisons and the court (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above)."

Last but not least, the Court considers that the fact that the proceedings before the Vilnius Regional Court were conducted in writing (see paragraph 20 above), does not mean, in and of itself, that the examination of the applicant’s complaints was in any sense formal, as alleged by him (see paragraph 61 above), or that the applicant was placed at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the State authorities – the Department of Prisons and the Prosecutor General’s Office – because the representatives of those institutions did not take part in that court hearing either so as to be able to counter the applicant’s written submissions to the Vilnius Regional Court (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Prebil, cited above, § 43). It follows, that each party had thus been given a reasonable opportunity to present its case under conditions that did not place it at a substantial disadvantage vis-a-vis its opponent. As the relevant case-law bears out, Article 6 § 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nideröst-Huber v. Switzerland, 18 February 1997, § 30, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997‑I), and to ensure that such fundamental principles as the right to adversarial proceedings and the principle of equality of arms have been respected.

As noted by the administrative courts, the applicant had not contested the reliability of that information (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above). The Court also takes into account the fact that, as pointed out by the Government, during the judicial proceedings regarding the disciplinary penalties, the applicant was even provided with the documents proving the lawfulness of the secret entry and surveillance that were not used in the disciplinary proceedings against him (see paragraph 24 in fine above). Similarly, the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant’s dismissal was based not only on the materials gathered through the interception of his telephone communications, but also on the entirety of the evidence, which included contracts with the telecommunications company and witness testimony (see paragraphs 39, 41 and 44 above). Thus, in the present case the applicant was apprised of the evidence against him and had the opportunity to respond to it.

The Court has emphasised that telephone tapping is a very serious interference with a person’s rights and that only very serious reasons based on a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in serious criminal activity should be taken as a basis for authorising it (see Iordachi and Others v.

                "82. The cardinal issue arising in the present case is whether the interference so found was justified in terms of paragraph 2 of Article 8. This paragraph, since it provides for an exception to a right guaranteed by the Convention, is to be narrowly interpreted. Powers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterising as they do the police state, are tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions (see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 47, ECHR 2000-V, see also Drakšas, cited above, § 54)."
            ],
            [
                "83. In order for the interference established above not to infringe Article 8, it must first of all have been “in accordance with the law” (see Drakšas, cited above, § 55), a condition which has been met in the present case, given that the interference had a basis in the Law on Criminal Intelligence. The Court is also satisfied that the measure was authorised by the court (see paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the authorisation to start monitoring the applicant’s telephone conversations had a legal basis in domestic law. The same conclusion holds true regarding the use of those materials within the disciplinary proceedings, as authorised by the prosecutor on the basis of Article 19 § 3 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence (see paragraph 25 above), that provision having been in force well before the applicant had committed the disciplinary offences, and the constitutionality of that provision having been confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 47, 50 and 51 above; compare Karabeyoğlu v. Turkey, no. 30083/10, §§ 78-84, 7 June 2016, and Eminağaoğlu v. Turkey, no. 76521/12, § 161, 9 March 2021). Besides, as to the requirement of foreseeability, it cannot mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly (see Drakšas, cited above, § 67). In the present case the Court also finds that the absence of prior notification of interception was compensated for in the Law on Criminal Intelligence, accessible to the applicant, as that Law laid down strict conditions with regard to the implementation of the surveillance measures."
            ],
            [
                "84. Regarding the legitimate aim, the Court observes that the applicant had been suspected of corruption-related activity – giving better conditions, as well as incentives, to inmates – for personal gain. Such actions, which could have led to inmates being released before they had reformed, demonstrated a danger to society (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). In this context the Court notes the domestic courts’ finding that such activity, which the applicant was suspected of, and which was not entirely without basis (see paragraph 31 above), could have placed people outside the prison walls in danger (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, as pointed out by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, the applicant’s actions discredited the system of the execution of sentences, and were damaging to society’s trust in public service (see paragraph 39 above). Likewise, as emphasised by the Supreme Administrative Court, the use of information gathered during the secret surveillance against the applicant served the purpose of guaranteeing the transparency and openness of public service, and sought to ensure that the aims of statutory institutions were not ignored (see paragraph 43 above). Prevention of acts of a corrupt nature and transparency and openness of State service have also been listed among legitimate aims by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). Seeing no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ findings, the Court therefore holds that the interference pursued a legitimate aim – the prevention of disorder or crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – in pursuance of Article 8 paragraph 2 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "85. The Court lastly turns to the necessity and proportionality of the interference. It observes that on 30 June 2015 the Vilnius Regional Court, acting on a request by the Prosecutor General’s Office, and on the basis of the information made available to that court by the Department of Prisons through the prosecutor, authorised the tapping of the applicant’s telephone on the basis of information that the applicant had been involved in corruption-related acts that amounted to an abuse of office (see paragraphs 6-8 above). As it appears from the prosecutor’s application, and as it was afterwards upheld by a court, by then other investigative measures had already been employed; however, they had been insufficient to investigate possible criminal activity (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 21 above). As later explained by the Vilnius Regional Court, that information included information about a particular inmate who had received better conditions in prison, and also incentives (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard to the facts of the case, the Court is ready to accept that the Vilnius Regional Court had sufficient reasons, based on specific information, to authorise and extend the measure of the telephone tapping (see also paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the Court cannot find that the authorisation was without grounds or that the surveillance was “general” or “exploratory” (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 51, Series A no. 28, see also Drakšas, cited above, § 56). Above all, on this last point the Court also reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. In principle, therefore, it is not for the Court to express an opinion contrary to that of the Vilnius Regional Court in its ruling of 30 June 2015 on the compatibility of the judicially ordered tapping of the applicant’s telephone with Article 10 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence (see Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998-II, and Drakšas, cited above, § 56)."
            ],
            [
                "86. Furthermore, although the applicant implied that the interception of his telephone communications had been exploratory (see paragraph 79 above), the Court cannot subscribe to that statement, because, as was clearly explained by the Vilnius Regional Court, during each three-month period that the measure was extended, new events materialised which showed the applicant’s involvement in illegal activities, and information about “new concrete events” proved to be true (see paragraph 21 above). The duration of the interception did not exceed the maximum twelve-month period, as set out in the Law on Criminal Intelligence, which was also pointed out by the domestic court (see paragraph 21 above). Lastly, as noted by the Vilnius Regional Court, the interception was proportionate in view of the applicant’s position – he was the director of a protected incarceration facility – which significantly reduced other means for a criminal investigation (see paragraph 22 above)."
            ],
            [
                "87. As regards the proportionality of the use of that information in the disciplinary proceedings, the Court gives weight to the applicant’s position as the director of a prison, and the seriousness of the acts which were investigated, and thus does not dispute the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court’s finding that the fact that no criminal investigation had been opened in respect of the applicant, in and of itself, did not make the use of the information obtained unlawful in the disciplinary proceedings (see paragraph 38 above). The Court also notes that the use of the materials obtained during the criminal intelligence investigation was not limitless; rather, under Article 19 § 3 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, it was restricted to acts of a corrupt nature (see paragraph 47 above). The proportionality of such use – in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the law enforcement institutions, and the need for a high disciplinary and moral standard for State officials, including the applicant, who was supposed to lead by example – was explained by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above). That court found that disciplinary offences, as committed by the applicant, had been established on the basis of the entirety of evidence, and the applicant had not contested the reliability of the collected information during the disciplinary investigation (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above). The applicant had also been able to contest the proportionality of the use of that information (see paragraph 41 above), this finding also having been reached by this Court (see paragraph 73 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that when assessing the necessity and proportionality of the use of such information for the investigation of the applicant’s disciplinary offences, the administrative courts followed the Constitutional Court’s guidelines and afforded effective protection of his rights (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). The fact that there had been no disproportionate interference with the applicant’s right to privacy has also been noted by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 23 and 40 above)."

In the case at hand, Mr R. recorded various conversations with the applicant but Mr R. himself decided whether he would record a conversation and, if so, whether he would hand the tape over to the National Police Internal Investigation Department. Mr R.'s acts were based on his wish to demonstrate his own credibility in respect of the statements given by him in the Fort-team fact-finding inquiry as well as for personal safety considerations. Against this background, the Government considered the provision of recording equipment as a perfectly responsible move on the part of the National Police Internal Investigation Department. As the recording of the conversations by Mr R. could not be equated with an investigative act by a private citizen, the Government submitted that there had been no interference with the applicant's rights under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention requiring justification under the second paragraph of this provision.

There is therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see Niemietz v.

The Court would note that the recording of private (telephone) conversations by a conversation partner and the private use of such recordings does not per se offend against Article 8 if this is done with private means, but that by its very nature this is to be distinguished from the covert monitoring and recording of communications by a private person in the context of and for the benefit of an official inquiry – criminal or otherwise – and with the connivance and technical assistance of public investigation authorities. In that respect, the Court observes that in the present case, although the recordings of the applicant's conversations were made by Mr R. on a voluntary basis and for his own purposes, the equipment was provided by the authorities, who on at least one occasion gave him specific instructions as to what information should be obtained from the applicant. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the authorities “made a crucial contribution to executing the scheme” and it is not persuaded that it was ultimately Mr R. who was in control of events. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to allowing investigating authorities to evade their responsibilities under the Convention by the use of private agents (see M.M. v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 40)."

After an extensive analysis of the mission of the Fort-team and the manner in which its inquiry had evolved, the Court of Appeal found no reasons for holding that this inquiry should be regarded as a covert criminal investigation or that, in the course of this inquiry, the applicant should have been regarded as a criminal suspect in connection with the “fruit-juice channel”."

In the instant case, the additional circumstances were that a number of conversations had been recorded, including the applicant's contributions to those conversations. Furthermore, the (telephone) conversations had been conducted by the applicant as the former “runner” of a (former) police informer about matters having occurred during the period in which the applicant “ran” Mr R. as informer and the winding-up of that relationship. As these conversations – in any event on the part of the applicant – were of an exclusively professional nature and content, the Court of Appeal held that, in view of domestic case-law on this point, this allowed no other conclusion than that the applicant's private life did not come into play in respect of the recorded (telephone) conversations at issue. It further held that Mr R.'s recourse to a recording device – and Mr R. had been entirely free to decide whether or not to activate it as well as to make the recordings available to the Fort-team – had mainly been prompted by Mr R.'s need to substantiate his account of the “fruit-juice channel” in order to be believed. The Court of Appeal therefore considered that it could not be said that there had been interference on the part of the authorities in respect of the recording. It only accepted the existence of such interference in breach of Article 8 § 1 in respect of the one recorded conversation for which Mr R. had received explicit instructions, to the extent that this conversation related to matters falling within the applicant's sphere of privacy.

The Court of Appeal found it relatively obvious that this verification, in view of the accounts of the inquiry in subsequent reports, had taken place in the form of tape-recordings and the preparation of transcripts and, in this connection, recalled its finding that the inquiry was not to be regarded as a (covert) criminal investigation."

In that respect, the Court observes that in the present case, although the recordings of the applicant's conversations were made by Mr R. on a voluntary basis and for his own purposes, the equipment was provided by the authorities, who on at least one occasion gave him specific instructions as to what information should be obtained from the applicant.

It further accepts that the Trustee in Bankruptcy’s discretion to open, read and make copies of the applicant’s correspondence was not open-ended but confined to particular items which might assist her in her capacity of Trustee in locating and securing the applicant’s assets for the benefit of his creditors. It is to be noted that the applicant was at the material time a bankrupt.

In the view of the Court, the Trustee in Bankruptcy must be taken to have known that the re-direction Order which she herself applied for and obtained no longer provided her with a legal basis to interfere with the applicant’s correspondence. On that account, the actions of the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 were not in accordance with the law. For that reason, there has been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and the Court does not consider it necessary to examine with respect to these particular items of correspondence whether the other conditions of paragraph 2 of that Article were complied with.",

Indeed, the Trustee in Bankruptcy was attentive to the applicant’s concern that his correspondence from the applicant’s legal advisers or the Convention institutions might be opened.

The Government stated in this connection that there was no benefit to Ms S.D. as Receiver in attempting to gain further information under the re-direction Order for the purposes of the receivership proceedings instigated under the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Under the confiscation Order of 8 August 1996 (see paragraph 14 above) the only powers available to Ms S.D. were to gain control of title documents to specified assets. It was left to the Crown Prosecution Service and the applicant to litigate the beneficial ownership of the assets.

The Court recalls that the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In determining whether an interference is “necessary in a democratic society” regard may be had to the State’s margin of appreciation (see the Campbell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 18, § 44). It further observes that in the field under consideration - the concealment of a bankrupt’s assets to the detriment of his creditors - the authorities may consider it necessary to have recourse to the interception of a bankrupt’s correspondence in order to identify and trace the sources of his income. Nevertheless, the implementation of the measures must be accompanied by adequate and effective safeguards which ensure minimum impairment of the right to respect for his correspondence. This is particularly so where, as in the case at issue, correspondence with the bankrupt’s legal advisers may be intercepted. The Court notes in this connection that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged and correspondence in that context, whatever its purpose, concerns matters of a private and confidential nature (the above-mentioned Campbell judgment, pp. 18-19, §§ 46 and 48)."

Under the terms of section 12 of the 1997 Act, special means of surveillance can be used with respect to, inter alia, (a) persons suspected of, or unwittingly used for, the preparation or commission of one or more of the serious offences listed in section 3(1) of the 1997 Act; (b) persons or objects related to national security; and (c) objects necessary to identify such persons (see paragraph 23 above). The wording of section 12 thus suggests that national security can be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance; this also follows from section 4 (see paragraph 22 above). But even if it is accepted that, as asserted by the Government with reference to the wording of section 14 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 22 above), under Bulgarian law national security cannot be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance, it remains the case that theoretically any individual in the country can be suspected of being involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in the planning or commission of a relevant criminal offence, and thus be him- or herself subjected to surveillance. It is also readily apparent that, regardless of whether they have themselves been placed under surveillance, individuals – or legal persons – can have their communications intercepted indirectly, as a result of the surveillance of another individual falling in one of the categories laid down in section 12 of the 1997 Act. It follows that all four applicants, including the two applicant organisations, may possibly be affected by the contested legislation. It is true that some surveillance techniques, such as visual surveillance and tracking (see paragraph 11 above), cannot be applied to legal persons as such. But it appears that in many cases the surveillance warrants authorise the use of those techniques alongside other surveillance techniques, such as tapping, which can affect the communications of legal persons (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above).",

In 2009 Bulgaria put in place a dedicated remedy in respect of secret surveillance, in the form of a claim for damages under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 136 above). The Court has recognised that such a claim is an effective remedy for people who have already learned that they have been subjected to surveillance as a result of criminal proceedings, in cases when the surveillance has taken place after the entry into force of that provision (see Harizanov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 53626/14, §§ 94-99, 5 December 2017)."

But that only concerns situations in which the surveillance has yielded information which has led to the production of evidentiary material later used – and hence disclosed – in criminal proceedings. Throughout the past decade, the instances of surveillance which have led to the production of such evidentiary material have ranged from about 24% to about 60% (see the table under paragraph 93 above). And it is far from certain that in all of those cases such evidentiary material has later led to the bringing of charges, and has thus been disclosed to the persons concerned in the context of criminal proceedings."

                "267. It appears that in all cases in which that has not happened, the only (lawful) way in which the people concerned can learn that they have been subjected to surveillance is a notification by the National Bureau. But the 1997 Act does not require that all such people be notified. Irrespective of whether it investigates on its own initiative or pursuant to a complaint by someone suspecting that he or she has been subjected to surveillance, the Bureau is only required to notify people subjected to surveillance unlawfully (as determined by it), and even then only if that notification would not defeat the purpose of the surveillance or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 130 above). In practice, the Bureau notifies few people, if any, each year, even in comparison to the number of complaints it receives (see the table under paragraph 135 above). It appears that in other cases it simply informs the people who have applied to it that they have not been subjected to unlawful surveillance, without specifying whether that means that (a) no surveillance has taken place, that (b) it has taken place but was lawful, or (c) that it was indeed unlawful but should not be revealed because doing so would defeat its purpose or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 131 above). In hypothesis (c), the wording of the Bureau’s notification, as transpiring from the three examples made available to the Court (see paragraph 131 above), would in fact be misleading since there has been unlawful surveillance but there are grounds to conceal that it has taken place. The recipients of such notifications have no means of challenging them and thus obtaining more information (see paragraph 133 above)."

It is true that section 2(1)(7) does not by its terms elevate such notification into a condition for the admissibility of such claims. But although that provision has already been in effect for more than twelve years, no cases have been reported in which claims under it have been successfully brought blindly, in the absence of prior notification by the Bureau or of information about surveillance which has emerged in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 140 above). Indeed, the apparently limited fact-finding capabilities of the civil courts in proceedings under section 2(1)(7) have already been noted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (f) above)."

That was recognised, even if indirectly, by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which held that the limitation period for bringing such a claim starts to run when the person concerned is notified by the Bureau, because without such notification that person has no means of vindicating his or her rights (see paragraph 138 (h) above). In a recent case, the Burgas Regional Court even expressly held that a claim under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act could be brought only if the use of special means of surveillance with respect to the claimant was apparent either from the materials adduced as evidence in a criminal case or from a notification by the Bureau (see paragraph 143 above)."

That means the courts may check for formal deficiencies but cannot delve into the most important issues – whether the surveillance whose lawfulness is being challenged before them was based on a reasonable suspicion and amounted to a proportionate interference with the claimant’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

The court noted that all of the surveillance applications pursuant to which the warrants had been issued had contained detailed reasons why they were to be allowed. By contrast, the warrants themselves were all one-page documents which did not contain any reference (save for a reference to the numbers of the applications) to the individual cases to which they related, and which were couched in terms general enough to be capable of relating to any possible surveillance application under of the 1997 Act or under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Only the operative provisions of each of the warrants mentioned that the case concerned an alleged offence under Article 321 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 above). All but one had allowed surveillance for the maximum statutory duration of two months, and all had authorised the use of several surveillance techniques: visual surveillance; eavesdropping and tapping; tracking; and marking and checking correspondence or computerised information (see paragraph 11 above). It was thus impossible to speculate about whether the judges who had issued the warrants had in fact reviewed the applications for them (although the absence of review could not be presumed). The court also noted that its statistics for 2017-18 showed that it had on average received twelve or thirteen applications a day in 2017, and thirteen or fourteen applications a day in 2018, and that the practice of not giving individualised reasons was general.

Although the 1997 Act does not say that in terms, in practice that evidentiary material may not reproduce all parts of the “primary recording” (see, for instance, реш. № 384 от 08.07.2017 г. по в. н. о. х. д. № 1182/2016 г., САС, upheld by реш. № 314 от 25.01.2018 г. по н. д. № 1118/2017 г., ВКС, I н. о.).

Article 15 § 1 also precluded legislation permitting the authorities to access retained data if, so far as relevant for the purposes of the present case, (a) the objective was not restricted to fighting serious crime, and (b) such access was not subject to prior review by a court or an independent authority. The CJEU based those conclusions on, among other things, the E ‑ Privacy Directive’s overall structure, including the general principle of confidentiality of communications laid down by it, and the requirement of strict necessity under European Union law for any limitations on the protection of personal data. Lastly, the CJEU declined to answer a question about whether the protection conferred by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, as construed by it, was wider than that under Article 8 of the Convention.

Secondly, many authorities could request surveillance, and the prosecuting authorities could uncontrollably open criminal proceedings against anyone. Thirdly, authorisation procedures were routinely flouted. Lastly, oversight by the National Bureau was ineffective in practice, which had made it pointless for the applicants to complain to it, especially since they could be subjected to surveillance indirectly, through the placing of contacts of theirs under surveillance. They had not brought a claim under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act since it would have been ineffective in their situation, and was moreover not available to the two applicant organisations, since it was open only to individuals.

In that earlier case, the Court scrutinised the system of secret surveillance in Bulgaria as it stood in mid-2007, whereas in the case at hand it must scrutinise that system as it stands now (see paragraph 293 below). The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions in Bulgaria have evolved considerably since 2007, as has the manner of their application (see in particular paragraphs 13 to 16 above).

The Court’s task in this case is not to assess whether the general measures taken by the Bulgarian authorities were sufficient to discharge their duty under Article 46 § 1 of the Convention to abide by that judgment; the Court has no jurisdiction to do so (see Ivanţoc and Others, cited above, § 91). Its task here is rather to examine whether the complaint that the system of secret surveillance in Bulgaria, as it stands now – granted, partly as a result of general measures taken to abide by Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 14 above) – falls short of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention is admissible and well-founded. Although that examination may in practice overlap or even in parts coincide with the supervision carried out by the Committee of Ministers, that does not take the complaint outside the Court’s jurisdiction.

The wording of section 12 thus suggests that national security can be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance; this also follows from section 4 (see paragraph 22 above). But even if it is accepted that, as asserted by the Government with reference to the wording of section 14 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 22 above), under Bulgarian law national security cannot be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance, it remains the case that theoretically any individual in the country can be suspected of being involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in the planning or commission of a relevant criminal offence, and thus be him- or herself subjected to surveillance. It is also readily apparent that, regardless of whether they have themselves been placed under surveillance, individuals – or legal persons – can have their communications intercepted indirectly, as a result of the surveillance of another individual falling in one of the categories laid down in section 12 of the 1997 Act. It follows that all four applicants, including the two applicant organisations, may possibly be affected by the contested legislation. It is true that some surveillance techniques, such as visual surveillance and tracking (see paragraph 11 above), cannot be applied to legal persons as such. But it appears that in many cases the surveillance warrants authorise the use of those techniques alongside other surveillance techniques, such as tapping, which can affect the communications of legal persons (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above).",

But the 1997 Act does not require that all such people be notified. Irrespective of whether it investigates on its own initiative or pursuant to a complaint by someone suspecting that he or she has been subjected to surveillance, the Bureau is only required to notify people subjected to surveillance unlawfully (as determined by it), and even then only if that notification would not defeat the purpose of the surveillance or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 130 above).

It appears that in other cases it simply informs the people who have applied to it that they have not been subjected to unlawful surveillance, without specifying whether that means that (a) no surveillance has taken place, that (b) it has taken place but was lawful, or (c) that it was indeed unlawful but should not be revealed because doing so would defeat its purpose or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 131 above). In hypothesis (c), the wording of the Bureau’s notification, as transpiring from the three examples made available to the Court (see paragraph 131 above), would in fact be misleading since there has been unlawful surveillance but there are grounds to conceal that it has taken place. The recipients of such notifications have no means of challenging them and thus obtaining more information (see paragraph 133 above)."

It is true that section 2(1)(7) does not by its terms elevate such notification into a condition for the admissibility of such claims. But although that provision has already been in effect for more than twelve years, no cases have been reported in which claims under it have been successfully brought blindly, in the absence of prior notification by the Bureau or of information about surveillance which has emerged in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 140 above).

That was recognised, even if indirectly, by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which held that the limitation period for bringing such a claim starts to run when the person concerned is notified by the Bureau, because without such notification that person has no means of vindicating his or her rights (see paragraph 138 (h) above). In a recent case, the Burgas Regional Court even expressly held that a claim under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act could be brought only if the use of special means of surveillance with respect to the claimant was apparent either from the materials adduced as evidence in a criminal case or from a notification by the Bureau (see paragraph 143 above)."

The maximum possible length of the initial authorisation in such cases – two years – rendered all other safeguards nugatory. The clause authorising surveillance without prior judicial authorisation in urgent cases was also particularly prone to abuse. The number of authorities which could request surveillance outside the framework of already pending criminal proceedings had increased throughout the years. For their part, the prosecuting authorities could obtain abusive and arbitrary surveillance in criminal proceedings by opening them without proper justification, which could not be controlled by the courts at the pre-trial stage or engage the personal liability of the public prosecutors doing so. The genuineness of the risk of such abuses had been illustrated by the publication in February 2020, on the initiative of the Chief Prosecutor, of intercepted conversations between the President of the Republic, who enjoyed full immunity from prosecution, and the commander of the Air Force."

That risk was not merely theoretical, as illustrated by the case of the Bureau’s first deputy chairperson. This had seriously affected the Bureau’s independence and had marginalised it, especially in the last few years. Several interviews and declarations of the Bureau’s first chairperson had highlighted the weakening of its role and of its supervision over the prosecuting authorities and the State Agency for National Security. Another issue had been the illegal curtailing of the possibility for the Bureau to access materials held by the prosecuting authorities. Lastly, the Bureau checked solely the surveillance’s formal legality, and only notified those concerned if they had been subjected to it unlawfully.

To obtain a warrant, the relevant authority had to make a reasoned application, and when examining that application the judge could request all supporting materials. The decision to issue a surveillance warrant had to be reasoned, and the judge reviewed whether all legal requirements were in place – including whether it was justified to resort to surveillance – on the basis of all materials in the case file rather than simply those provided by the requesting authority.

So do the facts underlying the 2016 criminal conviction of the President of the Sofia City Court (see paragraph 56 above). In 2014 she had authorised the surveillance of an automated police information system (which itself surely contained data about many persons), apparently considering that that system was an “object” within the meaning of section 12(1) of the 1997 Act.

Lastly, the law sets out the circumstances in which surveillance must be stopped (see paragraph 82 above). There is, all the same, one area of concern, and that is the potential duration of the initial authorisation for surveillance on national-security grounds, which is up to two years (see paragraph 79 (b) above). The sheer length of that period, coupled with the inherently unclear contours of the notion of national security, significantly weakens the judicial control to which such surveillance must be subjected. This point has already been noted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (c) above). Even if, as asserted by the Government (see paragraph 286 above), in practice the courts never issue such warrants for periods exceeding six months, that is not based on any statutory limitation."

The sophistication of the relevant provisions has since then grown (compare paragraphs 32 to 51 and 70 to 78 above with Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 12-17).

First, only a limited number of authorities can request surveillance, within the spheres of their respective competencies (see paragraphs 32 to 36 above). Secondly, the law appears to provide for a form of internal review preceding the submission of surveillance applications: those made by executive authorities must originate from the head of the respective authority, and public prosecutors intending to make such applications must notify their hierarchical superiors (see paragraph 37 above). Thirdly and most importantly, surveillance may be authorised only by the competent court president or an expressly authorised deputy (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above). Lastly, the authority which carries out the surveillance must, before proceeding with it, scrutinise the surveillance application for incompatibility ratione materiae or obvious mistakes and, if it spots issues in those respects, refer the application back to the judge who authorised the surveillance for reconsideration (see paragraph 73 above)."

An application must, in particular, (a) refer to the circumstances giving cause to suspect that a relevant offence is being prepared or committed or has been committed (including when it comes to national security), (b) set out (except in relation to terrorist offences) the investigative steps already taken and the results of any previous inquiries or investigations, (c) explain (except in relation to terrorist offences) why the requisite intelligence cannot be obtained through other means or why such other means would entail exceptional difficulties, and (d) explain (except in relation to terrorist offences) why the intended duration of the surveillance is necessary (see paragraphs 39 (a), (b), (d) and (f), 40 (a), (b), (e) and (f), and 41 (a) above). All materials on which the application is based must either be enclosed with it from the outset (for applications made outside criminal proceedings), or made available to the competent judge upon request (for applications made in the course of criminal proceedings) (see paragraph 44 above). When examining the application, the judge must review whether all legal prerequisites are in place and rule by means of a reasoned decision (see paragraph 51 above). One possible shortcoming at that stage is that although surveillance-warrant proceedings must of necessity be conducted without notice to the persons intended to be placed under surveillance, the requesting authority is under no duty to disclose to the judge fully and frankly all matters relevant to the well-foundedness of its surveillance application, including matters which may weaken its case."

The two courts in Bulgaria which have issued the highest number of surveillance warrants during the past decade were, by a large margin, the Sofia City Court (until 2015) and the Specialised Criminal Court (since 2015) (see the table under paragraph 49 above). According to an official report published in early 2017, until April 2015 all judges in the Sofia City Court issuing surveillance warrants gave no reasons whatever for their decisions, and in April-August 2015 gave, with few exceptions, only “blanket and generalised” reasons (see paragraph 59 (h) and (i) above). That is confirmed by the two 2012 and 2013 surveillance warrants issued by that court submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 61 above). It is true that after the scandal which erupted in 2015 in relation to the manner in which the Sofia City Court was processing surveillance applications (and which later led to the dismissal and criminal conviction of its president), the competent judges of that court began systematically giving reasons for their decisions to issue surveillance warrants (see paragraphs 56, 57 and 60 above). At about the same time, however, the number of surveillance applications addressed to that court sharply declined, and the largest number of such applications started being submitted to the Specialised Criminal Court (see the table under paragraph 49 above).

There is no reason to think that those warrants were somehow exceptional and represent anything other than the normal practice in that court."

This is of particular relevance as the contemporaneous provision of reasons is a vital safeguard against abusive surveillance (see Dragojević v. Croatia, no. 68955/11, §§ 88-101, 15 January 2015; Dudchenko v. Russia, no. 37717/05, §§ 97-98, 7 November 2017; and Liblik and Others v. Estonia, nos. 173/15 and 5 others, §§ 137-41, 28 May 2019). This is because the provision of reasons, even if succinct, is the only way of ensuring that the judge examining a surveillance application has properly reviewed the application and the materials which support it, and has truly directed his or her mind to the questions whether the surveillance would be a justified and proportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of the person(s) against whom it will be directed, and of any person(s) likely to be collaterally affected by it. In Bulgaria, that is particularly important in view of the applicants’ allegation – which seems corroborated by, inter alia, some recent developments (see paragraph 67 above) – that criminal proceedings can be opened in a frivolous and abusive manner, chiefly with a view to making it possible to place someone under surveillance for ulterior motives (see paragraph 279 above). As demonstrated by the arrangements in the Sofia City Court since August 2015, the provision of reasons, regardless of whether a surveillance application is allowed or refused, is not unachievable in practice, in spite of the fairly short time-limits for ruling on such applications (see paragraph 60 above)."

The Specialised Criminal Court has itself also drawn attention to the ever-increasing workload entailed by the large volume of surveillance applications submitted to it (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above), and the issue has already been highlighted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (b) above)."

Although that committee’s report, which was finalised in September 2021, is not yet publicly available, the statements which the Minister of Internal Affairs made in Parliament at the time when the committee was being set up already suggest that the problem with the absence of proper judicial scrutiny has seriously affected the surveillance operations authorised by the Specialised Criminal Court (see paragraph 67 above)."

When the authorities resort to that urgent procedure, the competent judge must within twenty-four hours assess and approve retrospectively the need for them to have done so; otherwise the surveillance operation must stop.

A further issue in this regard arises from the absence of legal provisions specifying with an appropriate degree of precision the fate of information resulting from secret surveillance which may have affected materials subject to legal professional privilege. It is open to question whether the Chief Prosecutor’s instruction on the point, which was a purely internal act issued pursuant to his power to make instructions governing the work of the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs 27 above), can be seen as “law” for the purposes of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 86, Series A no. 61; Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 68 and 79, Series A no. 82; and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 75, ECHR 2000-II). It is moreover doubtful whether that instruction lays down sufficient safeguards in respect of secret surveillance directed against lawyers, since it simply makes this subject to the existence of a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence (see paragraph 28 above), which is in principle a requirement for all surveillance, not just that directed against lawyers (see paragraphs 39 and 54 above). The instruction also seems to contradict the express terms of section 33(1), (2) and (3) of the Bar Act 2004, according to which all lawyers’ records and communications, regardless of their form, are privileged without exception (see paragraph 26 above). Nor does the instruction lay down enough safeguards with respect to materials obtained as a result of accidentally intercepted lawyer-client communications (see, mutatis mutandis, R.E. v. the United Kingdom, no. 62498/11, §§ 138-41, 27 October 2015, and Dudchenko v. Russia, no. 37717/05, § 107, 7 November 2017). Its only provision dealing with the issue, point 13, simply says that if the authorities intercept the conversation of a lawyer with a client or with another lawyer, and that conversation touches upon a client’s defence, they must not prepare evidentiary material on its basis, unless the surveillance reveals that the lawyer has him- or herself engaged in criminal activity (see paragraph 29 above). That leaves open the question how precisely any such intercept materials are to be destroyed, as expressly required by section 33(3) of the Bar Act 2004 (see paragraph 26 above).

The Bureau has also complained of the repeated provision of incorrect information by the main surveillance authority in Bulgaria, the Technical Operations Agency (see paragraph 118 in fine above). Such obstruction seriously weakens the Bureau’s oversight capabilities, and cannot be seen as justified (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 281). Providing Bureau members with access to all materials in the case file of a criminal case cannot prejudice ongoing investigations since those members have the highest security clearance and are bound by professional secrecy (see paragraphs 109, 110 and 129 above).

Claiming damages under the GDPR was impossible, since it did not apply to data processing by the authorities for law-enforcement purposes. Unlike the position with respect to secret surveillance, the 1988 Act did not envisage liability of the courts or the prosecuting authorities in connection with retained communications data.

By contrast, access applications made in the course of criminal proceedings, although expected to feature information about the alleged offence in connection with which access is being sought, are not expressly required to explain, in terms, why the data at issue is truly needed – they only have to contain a description of the circumstances underlying the access application, which appears to be an altogether looser requirement (see paragraph 172 above).

This card had contained a reference to Article 5b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule issued in 1973, on the basis of which in 1981 the applicant had been declared unfit for military service in peacetime. No text from this Article had appeared on the above document. Tavrida had acted unlawfully in 1997 in obtaining the wording of this Article, which contained sensitive medical data, from the military enlistment office without the applicant ’ s knowledge or consent. It had also acted unlawfully in including this information in the applicant ’ s personnel file in spite of its retention patently having been excessive for the purposes for which it had been kept. Next, Tavrida had acted unlawfully in using this information for a new purpose, that is to say for assessing and turning down the applicant ’ s applications for promotion in 1997 and 2000, in spite of the fact that this information had been very old and of inadequate detail for determining the applicant ’ s fitness for the position he sought. Above all, Article 5b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule was insufficiently specific. It applied equally to persons suffering from very serious psychotic disorders and to those suffering from mild temporary conditions. In fact, the applicant had never been in a psychotic state. Making any conclusions concerning his mental health on the basis of the information contained in this Article had created a false appearance that he might have suffered from a very serious disorder. Should the applicant ’ s employer have been concerned about his mental health in terms of his promotion, it could have solicited more recent and specific information, in particular by referring the applicant to a medical commission for the assessment of his fitness for promotion. Having obtained such a referral in 2002, the applicant had duly passed the necessary assessment and had eventually been placed on the reserve list and then promoted to an engineering position."

The fact that the information entered initially had not used the exact wording of Article 5b was immaterial in this context, as the Diseases and Handicaps Schedules had been accessible by the public. By contacting the military enlistment office in 1997, Tavrida had simply confirmed the information which had already been provided by the applicant himself, rather than actually obtaining additional information. In the Government ’ s view, this situation was factually comparable to that examined by the Court in the case of N.F. v. Italy (no. 37119/97, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX ).

Poland, cited above, § 94, and M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no. 28005/12, § 71, 7 July 201 5 ). The Court reiterates from its well established case-law that the wording “in accordance with the law” requires the impugned measure both to have some basis in domestic law and to be compatible with the rule of law, that is to say to be accessible, foreseeable and accompanied by necessary procedural safeguards affording adequate legal protection against arbitrary application of the relevant legal provisions (see, among other authorities, S. and Marper, cited above, § 95, and M.N. and Others, cited above, § 7 2 )."

In order to protect a person against arbitrariness, it is not sufficient to provide a formal possibility of bringing adversarial proceedings to contest the application of a legal provision to his or her case. Domestic courts must undertake a meaningful review of the authorities ’ actions affecting rights under the Convention in order to comply with the lawfulness requirement (see Y.Y ., cited above, § 50)."

            [
                "73. In addition to being lawful, the interference must also pursue a legitimate aim and be “necessary in a democratic society”. In determining whether the impugned measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court will consider whether, in the light of the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify them were relevant and sufficient and the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see, for example, Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 76, ECHR 2003 ‑ I). In this latter respect the Court has noted that, regard being had to the fundamental importance of data protection for effective exercise of one ’ s right to respect for private life, the margin of appreciation afforded to the member States in designing their respective legislative and administrative frameworks in this sphere is rather limited ( see, in particular, Peck, cited above, § § 77-78; and S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 10 2 -103). In this connection, the question of “ necessity of interference” may overlap with the question concerning quality of the requisite procedural safeguards afforded in the domestic law of the respondent State ( S. and Marper, cited above, § 99, and Avilkina and Others, cited above, § 37 )."

                "74. To date, a certain level of consensus on the international level and, in particular, between the Council of Europe member States has been achieved as regards the fundamental data protection principles and the corresponding basic procedural safeguards to be included in the national legislative frameworks in order to justify the necessity of any possible interference. These principles were formulated in a number of treaties and other legal instruments, including the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention no. 108 and other documents (see paragraphs 53- 60 above). The Court has previously referred to the relevant international instruments, most notably the Data Protection Convention, in assessing data processing and protection practices in individual cases brought under Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, drawing from that Convention, the Court has stated that the domestic law of the member States should notably ensure that personal data in issue are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are being collected or stored; that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored and that the retained data are efficiently protected from misuse and abuse ( see, among other authorities, Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 62, ECHR 2009). In line with internationally recognised data protection principles, the Court has also stated that it was essential for the applicable law to provide clear, detailed rules governing the scope and application of the relevant measures; as well as minimum safeguards concerning, inter alia, duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for their destruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness at each stage of its processing (see, in particular, S. and Marper, cited above, § 99 and the references therein, and M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 195). There are various crucial stages at which data protection issues under Article 8 of the Convention may arise, including during collection, storage, use and communication of data. At each stage, appropriate and adequate safeguards which reflect the principles elaborated in applicable data protection instruments must be put in place in order to justify the necessity of interference under Article 8 (see M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, ibid).",

It appears that this disagreement may have been connected to a structural problem in domestic law.

Austria, no. 20082/02, § 60, 16 July 2009 ). From this perspective, it considers that the question of quality of applicable law in the applicant ’ s case is closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 99, and Avilkina and Others, cited above, § 37).

The Court notes that at the time of the events giving rise to the present application, Ukraine was not a member of the Data Protection Convention or any other relevant international instrument. However, at the same time, its national legislation contained a number of safeguards similar to those which were included in these legal acts. Relevant provisions can be found, notably, in the Information Act of 1992 (see paragraph 38 above) and various acts pertaining to confidentiality of medical information (see paragraphs 39-40 above). However, it appears that these safeguards remained largely inoperative in the applicant ’ s case, both during the processing of his personal data by his employer, and during the examination of his relevant claims by the domestic courts.",

            ],
            [
                "84. First of all, in so far as the applicant complained that in the summer of 1997 his employer had collected without requisite justification and retained in his personnel file data which was excessive for the purposes of maintaining the obligatory military duty register of its employees, the Court notes at the outset that the disputed act of collection had taken place before the Convention entered into force in respect of Ukraine (11 September 19 97). It is therefore as such outside of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. At the same time, as the applicant ’ s complaint concerns, in essence, not only this initial act, but more broadly the fact that the relevant information was included in and retained on his file, the Court considers itself competent to address the issue of retention (see Rotaru, cited above, § 46)."
            ],
            [
                "85. In this connection the Court notes that the information added to the applicant ’ s file in 1997 contained nothing more than the wording of Article 5b of the 1973 Diseases and Handicaps Schedule. A reference to this Article had already been entered in the applicant ’ s file earlier, because this provision indicated the grounds for his dispensation from military service in peacetime. A reference to the grounds for dispensation from military service was a standard and mandatory entry in the military duty register as kept by every employer pursuant to Instruction no. 165. As the Court has been informed, the foregoing Schedule was a published document. Accordingly, the text of the aforementioned Schedule being publicly consultable at any point of time, the fact that the applicant ’ s employer obtained it from the military enlistment office in summer 1997 was of secondary importance. It follows that the applicant ’ s employer was in possession of the information concerning the grounds for the applicant ’ s dispensation from military service as a result of the general set-up of the applicable legislative framework, rather than the employer ’ s individual conduct, contrary to what the applicant suggests."
            ],
            [
                "86. The Court next notes that the aforementioned legislative framework essentially resulted in a quasi-automatic entitlement for any employer, whether public or private, to obtain and retain sensitive health-related data concerning any employee dispensed from military service on medical grounds. The Court notes that it is not in a position to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in deciding on the modalities of keeping the military duty registers. However, the Court reiterates that core principles of data protection require the retention of data to be proportionate in relation to the purpose of collection and envisage limited periods of storage (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 107 ). In line with this, the Court considers that delegating to every employer a public function involving retention of sensitive health-related data concerning their employees can only be justified under Article 8 if such retention is accompanied by particularly strong procedural guarantees for ensuring, notably, that such data would be kept strictly confidential, would not be used for any other purpose except that for which it was collected, and would be kept up ‑ to ‑ date (see, mutatis mutandis, I. v. Finland, cited above, § 37, and mutatis mutandis, Gardel, cited above, § § 69- 70 )."

            [
                "87. It appears that Instruction no. 165 listed some relevant safeguards, in particular a requirement that the military duty register be treated as a classified (secret) document and that the data contained in them be regularly synchronised with that retained by the military enlistment offices ( see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). At the same time, notwithstanding these requirements, the applicant ’ s employer retained the information dating back to 1981 and used it for deciding in 1997 and 2000 on the applicant ’ s requests for promotion, considering it permissible to disclose this information to third parties in this context."

The judicial authorities found that such practice was not contrary to the provisions of Article 32 of the Constitution and a number of other legal instruments, to which the applicant referred in his civil proceedings. Without responding directly to the applicant ’ s arguments concerning confidentiality of the disputed data, they essentially concluded that the employer ’ s conduct had been lawful, because the disputed information had once been lawfully obtained and there was no appearance of bad faith in discussing and using it in context of deciding on the question of the applicant ’ s promotion."

                "89. It follows that applicable law, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in the present case, permitted storage of the applicant ’ s health-related data for a very long term and allowed its disclosure and use for purposes unrelated to the original purpose of its collection. The Court considers that such broad entitlement constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for private life. It cannot be regarded necessary in a democratic society (see also Avilkina and Others, cited above, §§ 51-54 and S. and Marper, cited above, § 125).",

            [
                "91. The Court recognises that employers may have a legitimate interest in information concerning their employees ’ mental and physical health, particularly in the context of assigning them certain job functions connected to specific skills, responsibilities or competences. However, it underlines once again that collection and processing of the relevant information must be lawful and such as to strike a fair balance between the employer ’ s interests and the privacy-related concerns of the candidate for the relevant position."
            ],
            [
                "92. In this connection, the Court takes note of the applicant ’ s arguments that by the time his health data originating in 1981 was used for deciding on his promotion (1997 and 2000) it was quite old. In addition to that, as it did not indicate the specific nature of the applicant ’ s medical condition diagnosed at that time, it was also incomplete for the purposes of deciding whether or not he could be entrusted with the requested position. It is also notable that in 2002 the applicant was referred by his employer for a medical examination with a view to determining his fitness for the position he sought to occupy. Having obtained a positive conclusion, he was placed on a reserve list and subsequently promoted to his satisfaction (see paragraphs 17-18 above). The Court has not been provided with any reasons why this option for determining the applicant ’ s medical fitness could not have been used any earlier."
            ],
            [
                "93. The Court further observes that the applicant explicitly raised the arguments discussed in paragraph 9 2 above before the domestic courts referring to numerous legal instruments. In the meantime, the final decisions taken by the domestic judicial authorities do not provide any answers to these arguments and refer instead to the management ’ s exclusive discretion in personnel decisions and the applicant ’ s failure to demonstrate that his employer had acted in bad faith. They also noted that he had not ascertained the exact role of the individual officers in disclosing his mental-health data. It is not evident from the text of these judgments that the national courts analysed whether using the disputed data by the applicant ’ s employer in deciding, within its discretion, whether to promote the applicant and rejecting the promotion request on its basis struck a fair balance between the employer ’ s interests and the applicant ’ s privacy-related concerns. The same was also true concerning the applicant ’ s complaint about disclosure of this data to the applicant ’ s co-workers in context of the decision-making procedure and its communication to the court in the course of a public hearing (compare also with Panteleyenko v. Ukraine, no. 11901/02, §§ 57 ‑ 61, 29 June 2006). The crux of the applicant ’ s complaints was therefore left outside the scope of the judicial examination. The judicial authorities have thus not provided relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the necessity of the interference complained of."

It considered that IP addresses were included in such traffic data. The Constitutional Court, however, concluded that the applicant, who had not hidden in any way the IP address through which he had accessed the Internet, had consciously exposed himself to the public and could not legitimately have expected privacy. As a result, the data concerning the identity of the user of the IP address were not protected as communication privacy under Article 37 of the Constitution, but only as information privacy under Article 3 8 of the Constitution, and no court order was required in order to disclose them in the applicant ’ s case."

                "“ Review of the objections regarding access to the complainant ’ s IP address by the Swiss police",
                "11. The second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution provides a higher level of protection than Article 8 of the ECHR as it requires a court order for any interference with the right to communication privacy ... The right to communication privacy determined by the first paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution primarily protects the content of the communicated message. ... In addition to the message content, the circumstances and facts related to the communication are also protected. In accordance with this view, in Decision No. Up-106/05, dated 2 October 2008 (Official Gazette RS, No. 100/08, and OdlUS XVII, 84) the Constitutional Court extended the protection provided by Article 37 of the Constitution also to such data regarding telephone calls that by their nature constitute an integral part of communication so that such data cannot be obtained without a court order. The mentioned Decision refers otherwise to telephone communication, but the same conclusion can be applied mutatis mutandis to other types of communication at a distance. The crucial constitutional review test for the review of the Constitutional Court whether a particular communication is protected under Article 37 of the Constitution is the test of the legitimate expectation of privacy.",
                "12. Communication via the internet takes place, in principle, in an anonymous form, which is essential for the free development of personality, freedom of speech, and the expression of ideas, and, consequently, for the development of a free and democratic society. The privacy of communication protected by the strict conditions determined by the second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution is therefore a very important human right that is becoming increasingly important due to technological advances and the related growing possibilities of monitoring. It entails individuals ’ legitimate expectation that the state will leave them alone also in their communication through modern communication channels and that they do not necessary have to defend themselves for what they do, say, write or think. If there is a suspicion of a criminal offense the Police must have the ability to identify the individuals who have participated in a certain communication related to an alleged criminal offense, because the perpetrators are harder to trace due to this principle of anonymity on the internet. The conditions under which the Police can carry out investigative actions and whether they need a court order, however, depend on whether such entail an interference with the right to communication privacy.",
                "13. As was pointed out above, in addition to the content of communications, Article 37 of the Constitution also protects traffic data. Traffic data signifies any data processed for the transmission of communications in an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof. Such entails that the IP address is a traffic datum. The Constitutional Court must therefore answer the question whether the complainant legitimately expected privacy regarding this datum.",
                "14. Two factors must be weighed in relation to this review: the expectation of privacy regarding the IP address and the legitimacy of this expectation, where the latter must be of such nature that the society is willing to accept it as legitimate. The complainant in the case at issue communicated with other users of the Razorback network by using the eMule application to exchange various files, including those that contained child pornography. With regard to the general anonymity of internet users and also the content of the files, the Constitutional Court has no doubt that the complainant expected that his communications would remain private, and he also certainly expected that his identity would not be disclosed. The question therefore is whether such expectation of privacy was legitimate. The complainant has not established that the IP address through which he accessed the internet was hidden in any way, and thus invisible to other users, or that access to the Razorback network (and thus to the content of the files) was in any way restricted, for example by passwords or other means. ... In contrast, in the complainant ’ s case anyone interested in exchanging such data could have accessed the contested files, and the complainant has not demonstrated that his IP address was in any way concealed or inaccessible by other users of this network. This leads to the conclusion that this entailed an open line of communication with a previously undetermined circle of strangers using the internet worldwide who have shown interest in sharing certain files, while at the same time access to the IP addresses of other users was not limited to users of this network. Therefore, in the view of the Constitutional Court, the complainant ’ s expectation of privacy was not legitimate; that which a person knowingly exposes to the public, even if from a home computer and the shelter of his or her own home, cannot be a subject of the protection afforded by Article 37 of the Constitution. In view of the foregoing, the contested standpoint of the Supreme Court does not raise concerns regarding constitutional law. Obtaining the data regarding the complainant ’ s dynamic IP address does not interfere with his right to communication privacy determined by the first paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution taking into account all the circumstances of the case, therefore a court order was not necessary to access it. By his conduct the complainant himself waived his right to privacy and therefore could not have a legitimate expectation of privacy therewith.",

                "16. The complainant also challenges the standpoint of the Supreme Court that by its request to the service provider under the third paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA the Police did not acquire traffic data, but only data regarding a particular user of a determined means of communication ...",
                "17. In the case at issue, on 7 June 2006, on the basis of the third paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA, the Police sent a request to the service provider for data regarding the user to whom IP address 195.210.223.200 was assigned on 20 February 2006 at 13:28. In the response, they received data regarding the user ’ s name, surname, and address, while the time of the communication set to the nearest second was already known. Then on 14 December 2006 the Police also obtained an order issued by the investigating judge on the basis of the first paragraph 149.b of the CPA and the service provider also provided the traffic data on the basis of this order. The main issue for the Constitutional Court at this point is therefore whether obtaining the data regarding the identity of the user of a determined IP address falls within the framework of communication privacy.",
                "18. In accordance with the position of the Constitutional Court in Decision No. Up-106/05, Article 37 of the Constitution also protects traffic data, i.e. data regarding, for example, who, when, with whom, and how often someone communicated. The identity of the communicating individual is one of the important aspects of communication privacy, therefore it is necessary to obtain a court order for its disclosure in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution. Despite this standpoint, the Constitutional Court decided that the complainant ’ s allegation of a violation of Article 37 of the Constitution is unfounded in the case at issue. By his conduct, the complainant has himself waived protection of his privacy by publicly revealing both his own IP address as well as the content of his communications, and therefore can no longer rely on it as regards the disclosure of his identity. Since by such he also waived the legitimate expectation of privacy, the data regarding the identity of the IP address user no longer enjoyed protection in terms of communication privacy, but only in terms of information privacy determined by Article 38 of the Constitution. Therefore, by obtaining the data on the name, surname, and address of the user of the dynamic IP address through which the complainant communicated the Police did not interfere with his communication privacy and therefore did not require a court order to disclose his identity. In view of the foregoing, the contested position of the Supreme Court is not inconsistent with Article 37 of the Constitution, and the complainant ’ s complaints in this part are unfounded. ”",

However, in her view, the police wishing to obtain identification of the subscriber should have requested a court order. She pointed out that the Constitutional Court ’ s conclusion implied that the protection of privacy of traffic data was always dependent on the protection of the content of communication. Accordingly, traffic data concerning certain communication were protected as long as the content of that communication was protected.

            [
                "33. As regards the applicant ’ s expectation of online anonymity, Judge Jadek Pensa argued that none of the data publicly disclosed by the complainant revealed his identity. In her view, anonymity was what prevented the police from linking a particular communication with a particular person – that is, linking a dynamic IP address and an individual with his or her name and address. She further argued that the question whether the applicant ’ s manner of communication could lead to the conclusion that his expectation of privacy had not been objectively justified had to be approached by taking all the circumstances into account, including the law that had been in force at the relevant time. She explained that the ECA (sections 103(1(2)), 104(1) and 107 – see paragraphs 37 below ) required Internet providers to delete traffic data as soon as they were no longer needed for the transfer of messages. Moreover, section 1 0 7 of the ECA provided that the secrecy of communication could be interfered with only on the basis of a decision by a competent authority. A letter from the police to an Internet provider could not be considered to amount to such a decision. Thus, even if section 149b(3) of the CPA could be interpreted as allowing the police to ask for information on an Internet subscriber, it should not apply in the situations covered by the ECA, which explicitly concerned the “protection of secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communications”. Otherwise, the legislation would be contradictory. The judge concluded that the applicable legal framework could not therefore have led to the conclusion that the applicant, as a reasonably and sufficiently informed individual, could not have expected privacy; that is, he could not have expected that his anonymity would be protected."

The traffic datum – the dynamic IP address that was assigned randomly at a given moment – as I understand it, reveals how the internet was used on some computer, because it is inextricably attached to a specific connection. ... This is because only the two data jointly communicate how the internet was used in a non-anonymised way, i.e. regarding internet use in connection with an identified person. This essential circumstance in my opinion negates the notion of the neutrality of the datum regarding a specific user of services for a certain (known) dynamic IP address that the police sought through the service provider - namely, the neutrality of the datum in terms of denying its ability to communicate anything more than the name and address of a certain person (who has a subscription contract with the service provider). Precisely because this datum is inseparably linked to a specific communication, the traffic datum falls within the scope of protected communication privacy.",
                "10. Even if the service provider communicated to the police ‘ only ’ the data identifying a person who had a subscription contract with it, by doing so, as I understand it, the service provider in fact communicated (to put it simply) traffic data in an electronic communications network regarding this person. The police also, as I have already explained, wanted to determine more than just the name and surname of a certain person who had concluded a contract. Since, as I understand it, they asked for traffic data associated with a particular person they would have to proceed according to the first paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA and obtain an order from the investigating judge.”",

The CJEU went on to determine whether a dynamic IP address, in that case registered by an online media service provider, may be treated as data relating to an “ identifiable natural person ” within the meaning of Article 2(a) of the Data Protection Directive. For that purpose the CJEU, relying on recital 26, considered whether the possibility to combine the dynamic IP address, which was in the case at issue in the hands of the online media service provider, with the additional data held by the ISP constituted a means likely reasonably to be used to identify the data subject (§§ 41 and 45).

Under section 113 of the Telecommunications Act (“ the TCA ”) the telecommunications service providers were required to supply, at the request of the competent (including law - enforcement) agencies, information on certain data collected, for the purpose of, inter alia, prosecuting criminal offences or regulatory offences. The impugned statutory provision was designed to be able to attribute if possible all telecommunications numbers to their respective subscribers (and in addition, ultimately, if possible, to their users). As found by the GFCC, the provision gave no specific thresholds of encroachment which would have defined its scope in more detail. Instead, it always permitted information in the individual case if this was necessary to perform the aforementioned duties. The GFCC did not find this in itself unconstitutional. However, the question that also arose was whether the impugned provision also covered information on the owner of a dynamic IP address. At the outset, the GFCC addressed the issue of a link between the subscriber information and the pre-existing content information which could be attributed to it. It found as follows ( § 113, a citation from a translation provided on the GFCC ’ s website ):",
                "“ ... the secrecy of telecommunications [Article 10.1 of the Basic Law] does not protect the confidentiality of the circumstances of each provision of telecommunications services, such as for example the attribution of the telecommunications numbers allocated by the service providers to particular subscribers.”"

                "“ ... the attribution of a static IP address to a particular subscriber – more precisely, to a network interface of the subscriber – as a rule also gives indirect information on a particular telecommunications event involving the person in question, since such addresses, even if they are static, are registered and become the subject of attributions identifying an individual almost only in connection with specific communications events. However, here too the conveying of information in this connection is as such limited exclusively to the abstract attribution of number and subscriber.",
                "... In contrast, the situation is different when dynamic IP addresses are attributed to identified persons, for such addresses are particularly closely related to specific telecommunications events. This attribution is within the area of protection of Article 10.1 of the Basic Law. However, here too this does not automatically follow from the fact that the attribution of a dynamic IP address necessarily always relates to a specific telecommunications event of which it therefore indirectly also provides information. For in this connection too the information itself only relates to data which are abstractly attributed to a subscriber. There is therefore no fundamental difference from the attribution of static IP addresses. However, the application of Article 10.1 of the Basic Law is here based on the fact that when the telecommunications enterprises identify a dynamic IP address, they have to take an intermediate step, in which they examine the relevant connection data of their customers, that is, [they] must access specific telecommunications events. These telecommunications connections individually stored by the service providers are subject to the secrecy of telecommunications, irrespective of whether they have to be kept available by the service providers under a statutory duty ... or whether they are stored by them on a contractual basis. Insofar as the legislature imposes a duty on the telecommunications enterprises to access these data and to evaluate them in the interest of the state ’ s performance of its duties, this is an encroachment upon Article 10.1 of the Basic Law. This is the case not only if the service providers must supply the connection data themselves, but also if they have to use the data as a preliminary question for information. ”"

                "“ ... The allocation of static IP addresses, whose attribution is at present in any case publicly accessibly in practice, is essentially restricted to institutions and large-scale users. The possibility of retrieving such numbers has little weight in these circumstances.",

For the question of the weight of encroachment of the identification of an IP address does not primarily depend – even if a number of fundamental rights apply in this case – on whether an IP address is technically dynamic or static, but on the actual significance of the creation of a duty of information in this connection. But if in practice static IP addresses are allocated to a great extent to private persons too, this may possibly mean that the identities of internet users are broadly or at least largely determined and that communications events in the internet are de-anonymised not only for a limited period of time, but permanently. Such a far-reaching possibility of de-anonymisation of communication in the internet goes beyond the effect of a traditional telephone number register. ... [T]he weight for the person affected of the attribution of an IP address to a subscriber may not be equated to that of the identification of a telephone number, because the former makes it possible to access information whose scope and content are substantially more far-reaching .... In view of this increased information potential, the general possibility of the identification of IP addresses would only be constitutionally permissible subject to narrower limits ... ”"

Spencer (2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212) case concerned the retrieval, without prior judicial authorisation, of the appellant ’ s sister ’ s subscriber information associated with a dynamic IP address, which the police had obtained in relation to online file-sharing involving child pornography. On the basis of the subscriber information received from the ISP, the police obtained a search warrant against the appellant. The latter sought to exclude the evidence found on his computer on the basis that the police actions in obtaining his address from the ISP without prior judicial authorisation amounted to an unreasonable search contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada ( “the SCC ” ) of 13 June 2014, finding in favour of the appellant, was delivered by Judge Cromwell."

                "69. Referring to the previous case-law on the matter, the judgment noted that the reasonable expectation of privacy standard was normative rather than simply descriptive and that it was inevitably “laden with value judgments which [were] made from the independent perspective of the reasonable and informed person who [was] concerned about the long-term consequences of government action for the protection of privacy” ( § 18). The SCC, contrary to the opinion of the trial judge, found that the appellant ’ s subjective expectation of privacy was justified by the fact that he had been the one using the network connection to transmit sensitive information. The judgment went on to determine whether the appellant ’ s subjective expectation of privacy had been reasonable. For that purpose the judgment looked at two circumstances: the nature of the privacy interest at stake and the statutory and contractual framework governing the ISP ’ s disclosure of subscriber information. As to the former, Judge Cromwell drew the following conclusions:",
                "“ [ 31 Thus, it is clear that the tendency of information sought to support inferences in relation to other personal information must be taken into account in characterizing the subject matter of the search.",

                "[ 41 ] There is also a third conception of informational privacy that is particularly important in the context of Internet usage. This is the understanding of privacy as anonymity. In my view, the concept of privacy potentially protected by s. 8 [right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure] must include this understanding of privacy.",
                "[ 50 ] ... In the circumstances of this case, the police request to link a given IP address to subscriber information was in effect a request to link a specific person (or a limited number of persons in the case of shared Internet services) to specific online activities. This sort of request engages the anonymity aspect of the informational privacy interest by attempting to link the suspect with anonymously undertaken online activities, activities which have been recognized by the Court in other circumstances as engaging significant privacy interests ....",
                "[51] I conclude therefore that the police request to Shaw [ISP] for subscriber information corresponding to specifically observed, anonymous Internet activity engages a high level of informational privacy. I agree with Caldwell J.A. ’ s conclusion on this point:",

In my judgment, it matters not that the personal attributes of the Disclosed Information pertained to Mr. Spencer ’ s sister because Mr. Spencer was personally and directly exposed to the consequences of the police conduct in this case. As such, the police conduct prima facie engaged a personal privacy right of Mr. Spencer and, in this respect, his interest in the privacy of the Disclosed Information was direct and personal ... ”"

The judgment also answered the concerns of the prosecution authorities to the effect that recognising a right to online anonymity would carve out a crime-friendly Internet landscape. While acknowledging that this concern could not be taken lightly, Judge Cromwell explained that recognising an interest could not be equated to a right to anonymity and that in the present case, for example, it had seemed clear that the police could have easily obtained a production order for the subscriber information."

As regards the question whether the expectation of privacy was reasonable in the face of the relevant contractual and statutory provisions, the judgment found that the ISP ’ s collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of its subscribers had been subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ( “ PIPEDA ” ), which protected personal information held by organisations engaged in commercial activity from being disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the person to whom the information related. The judgment found as follows:",
                "“[ 62 ] Section 7(3) ( c. 1)(ii) allows for disclosure without consent to a government institution where that institution has identified its lawful authority to obtain the information. But the issue is whether there was such lawful authority which in turn depends in part on whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the subscriber information. PIPEDA thus cannot be used as a factor to weigh against the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy ... Given that the purpose of PIPEDA is to establish rules governing, among other things, disclosure “of personal information in a manner that recognizes the right of privacy of individuals with respect to their personal information” ( s. 3 ), it would be reasonable for an Internet user to expect that a simple request by police would not trigger an obligation to disclose personal information or defeat PIPEDA ’ s general prohibition on the disclosure of personal information without consent.”"

The court refused to draw a parallel with other police routine inquires, such as an interview with the victim of a crime. Referring to R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, it found as follows:",
                "“[ 67 ] ... In Duarte, the Court distinguished between a person repeating a conversation with a suspect to the police and the police procuring an audio recording of the same conversation. The Court held that the danger is ‘ not the risk that someone will repeat our words but the much more insidious danger inherent in allowing the state, in its unfettered discretion, to record and transmit our words ’ ... Similarly in this case, the police request that the ISP disclose the subscriber information was in effect a request to link Mr. Spencer with precise online activity that had been the subject of monitoring by the police and thus engaged a more significant privacy interest than a simple question posed by the police in the course of an investigation.”",

Referring to the German Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 24 January 2012 (see paragraph 63 above), the applicant argued that by choosing a dynamic IP address, as had the subscriber in the present case, one chose to have his or her identity concealed, as additional data were required for identifying the computer used to access the Internet and thereby the subscriber.

As regards the letter, the applicant alleged that at the time when the Slovenian police had obtained the data connecting his IP address to his identity, the law regulating access to such data had not been clear ( lex certa ) and therefore the lawfulness required by the second paragraph of Article 8 had not been met. In particular, at the time of the interference (August 2006), the domestic law provisions regarding this issue had been contradictory. The second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution required a court order for interference with the right to privacy of communication. The ECA provided that traffic data should be kept secret and that communication could be intercepted only on the basis of an order by a competent authority. In the domestic legal system that could only be a court order or, theoretically, a prosecution order. Anyhow, under section 107 it was possible only to “intercept” data and not to hand over certain retained data. Moreover, the providers were under an obligation to delete retained data pursuant to section 104 as soon as they no longer needed them for billing purposes. On the other hand, section 149b ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of the CPA provided for different conditions of accessing data and it was unclear what the distinction in application between the two was.

As a preliminary matter, the Court further notes that an IP address is a unique number assigned to every device on a network, which allows the devices to communicate with each other. Unlike the static IP address, which is permanently allocated to a particular network interface of a particular device, a dynamic IP address is assigned to a device by the ISP temporarily, typically each time the device connects to the Internet (see paragraphs 61, 87 and 90 above). The IP address alone enables certain details, such as the ISP to which the user is connected and a broader physical location, most likely the location of the ISP, to be determined. Most dynamic IP addresses can thus be traced to the ISP and not to a specific computer. To obtain the name and address of the subscriber using a dynamic IP address, the ISP is normally required to look up this information and for that purpose to examine the relevant connection data of its subscribers (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above)."

An Internet user may be anonymous to the wider public while being identifiable by a service provider through an account or contact data that may be either unverified or subject to some kind of verification – ranging from limited verification (for example, through activation of an account via an e-mail address or a social network account) to secure authentication, be it by the use of national electronic identity cards or online banking authentication data allowing rather more secure identification of the user. A service provider may also allow an extensive degree of anonymity for its users, in which case the users are not required to identify themselves at all and they may only be traceable – to a limited extent – through the information retained by Internet access providers. The release of such information would usually require an injunction by the investigative or judicial authorities and would be subject to restrictive conditions. It may nevertheless be required in some cases in order to identify and prosecute perpetrators.”",

Indeed, it would appear that in order to identify a subscriber to whom a particular dynamic IP address had been assigned at a particular time, the ISP must access stored data concerning particular telecommunication events (see, for instance, paragraphs 29, 61, 65 and 95 above ). Use of such stored data may on its own give rise to private life considerations (see paragraph 103 above)."

The Court notes in this connection that there is a zone of interaction of a person with others which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see paragraph 100 above). Information on such activities engages the privacy aspect the moment it is linked to or attributed to an identified or identifiable individual ( for reference to identifiability, albeit in a rather different context, see Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ I, and J.S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 445/10, §§ 70 and 72, 3 March 2015). Therefore what would appear to be peripheral information sought by the police, namely the name and address of a subscriber, must in situations such as the present one be treated as inextricably connected to the relevant pre - existing content revealing data ( see the dissenting Constitutional Court judges ’ opinions cited in paragraphs 31 and 34; compare also with the position of the Canadian Supreme Court, cited in paragraphs 69 and 72 above, and the German Federal Constitutional Court, cited in paragraphs 64 and 65 above ).

It is of little significance that the applicant ’ s name was not mentioned in the subscriber information obtained by the police. Indeed, it is not unusual for one household to have a single subscription to the Internet service used by several members of the family.

In this connection, the Slovenian Constitutional Court and the respondent Government (see paragraphs 14 and 18 of the Constitutional Court ’ s decision, cited in paragraph 29 above; see also paragraph 92 above) found it important that the applicant had participated in the Razorback network to which access had not been restricted. They considered that he had knowingly exposed his online activity and associated dynamic IP address to the public.

However, unlike the Constitutional Court, the Court considers that the fact that he did not hide his dynamic IP address, assuming that it is possible to do so, cannot be decisive in the assessment of whether his expectation of privacy was reasonable from an objective standpoint.

This anonymity conception of privacy is an important factor to be taken into account in the present assessment. In particular, it has not been argued that the applicant had ever disclosed his identity in relation to the online activity in question (see in this connection the dissenting opinion of Judge Jadek Pensa, cited in paragraph 33 above ) or that he was for example identifiable by the particular website provider through an account or contact data. His online activity therefore engaged a high degree of anonymity (see Delfi AS, cited in paragraph 105 above, § 148), as confirmed by the fact that the assigned dynamic IP address, even if visible to other users of the network, could not be traced to the specific computer without the ISP ’ s verification of data following a request from the police."

In addition, compatibility with the rule of law requires that domestic law provides adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Amann, cited above, §§ 76-77; Bykov v.

Furthermore, the ECA (see paragraph 37 above), which specifically regulated the secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communication, did not at the relevant time provide for the possibility that subscriber information and related traffic data be accessed and transferred for the purposes of criminal proceedings. It provided that electronic communications, including the related traffic data, were confidential and as such should be protected by the ISP (see paragraph 37 above). It further stipulated that the ISP should not transfer the traffic data to others unless this was necessary for the provision of the service, except where the lawful interception of communications had been ordered by the competent authority (see section 103 of the ECA, cited in paragraph 37 above).

More specifically, according to the Constitutional Court ’ s interpretation, which was consistent with its previous case-law finding that the traffic data, as defined under the domestic law, fell within the protection of Article 37 of the Constitution ( ibid. ), the disclosure of subscriber information associated with a certain dynamic IP address in principle required a court order and could not be obtained by means of a simple written request by the police."

However, the Court, having regard to its findings in the context of the applicability of Article 8, does not find the Constitutional Court ’ s position on that question to be reconcilable with the scope of the right to privacy under the Convention (see paragraphs 115 to 118 above). Bearing in mind the Constitutional Court ’ s finding that the “identity of the communicating individual” fell within the scope of the protection of Article 37 of the Constitution (see paragraph 128 above) and the Court ’ s conclusion that the applicant had a reasonable expectation that his identity with respect to his online activity would remain private ( see paragraphs 115 to 118 above), a court order was necessary in the present case. Moreover, nothing in the domestic law prevented the police from obtaining it given that they, a few months after obtaining the subscriber information, during which time apparently no investigative steps had been taken in the case, requested and obtained a court order for what would seem to be, at least in part, the same information as that which had already been in their possession (see paragraph 8 above).

Indeed, the relevant provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Police Act and the Rules on Police Conduct, which were in force at the time when the DNA samples were taken from the applicants and on which the authorities relied in their cases (see paragraphs 9 and 16 above), authorised the police to collect, process and store personal data, including DNA material, in order to establish the identity of a person who is suspected of committing a crime. Such material can be collected irrespective of the nature or seriousness of the offence of which the person is suspected. The consent of the person concerned is not required (see paragraph 29 above). Such data is to be stored no longer than it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data has been collected. The subsequent amendments to the Police Act and the Criminal Proceedings Act contain further provisions in this respect (see paragraphs 26 - 2 8 above)."

In particular, they submitted that the purposes for which DNA samples could be taken and profiles stored were couched in broad terms and that the relevant national provisions did not specify the duration of the retention of DNA material in respect of convicted persons, such as themselves."

However, the issues related to the conditions attached to it and arrangements for the storing of DNA material are closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly, it does not find it necessary to decide whether the applicable rules meet the “quality of law” requirements within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention ( see S. and Marper, cited above, § 99)."

                "50. The relevant Convention principles are summarised in the Court ’ s judgment in the case of S. and Marper ( ibid., §§ 101-104). Unlike that case, which concerned the retention of personal data of persons not convicted, the question in the present case is whether the retention of the DNA data of the applicants, as persons who were convicted of aggravated theft, was justified under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention."

                "51. The Court notes that the applicants ’ DNA samples and DNA profiles derived from those samples were taken in view of the criminal proceedings brought against them on suspicion of aggravated theft. Whereas the first applicant ’ s conviction was based on the DNA findings, the DNA material taken from the second applicant was not indispensable in securing his conviction given that that material was not used as evidence against him. The Court also observes, as argued by the Government (see paragraph 42 above), that the applicants ’ DNA profiles were not used in any other criminal proceedings against them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court recognises the importance of such information in the detection of crime and particularly in combating recidivism (see, mutatis mutandis, Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 63, ECHR 2009). However, it reiterates that the mere retention and storage of personal data by public authorities is to be regarded as having a direct impact on the private-life interest of the individual concerned, irrespective of whether subsequent use is made of the data (see S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 121). Accordingly, it will examine whether the retention of the applicants ’ DNA material, as regulated under the national legislation, is proportionate and strikes a fair balance between the competing public and private interests."
            ],
            [
                "52. In this connection, it observes that the applicable legislation at the time did not set a specific time-limit for the retention of DNA data of the applicants as convicted persons. Indeed, as stated by the Government, DNA profiles were to be recorded in the relevant registers and “retained for a certain [length of] time, but not indefinitely ( засекогаш ) ”. That such data “may be retained until it has fulfilled the purpose for which it has been taken” (see paragraph 21 above) is open to various interpretations. The amendments to the Police Act (see paragraph 26 above) introduced subsequent to the taking of DNA samples from the applicants provide that DNA data is stored in the relevant register permanently. In the absence of anything to suggest that such retention may be linked to any fixed point in time, the Court considers that the respondent State permits indefinite retention period of DNA profiles. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above) concern personal data taken from a person in respect of whom no criminal proceedings were initiated and cannot therefore be applied to the applicants, whose guilt was established by a final court judgment."
            ],
            [
                "53. Furthermore, it has not been argued that the nature or gravity of the offence of which a person was convicted, or received a penalty for, or any other defined criteria, such as previous arrests, and any other special circumstances, have any bearing on the collection, storage and retention of DNA records (see, S. and Marper, cited above, § 119, and conversely, Peruzzo and Martens v. Germany ( dec. ), nos. 7841/08 and 57900/12, 4 June 2013, § 44). Moreover, whereas the police are vested with the power to delete personal data from the registers (see paragraph 24 above), the law is silent on the conditions under which it can be done and procedure to be followed. Whereas the law provides, in general terms, for the possibility of judicial review coupled with a prior administrative review, there is no provision allowing for a specific review of the necessity of data retention. Similarly, there is no provision under which a person concerned can apply to have the data concerning him or her deleted if conserving the data no longer appears necessary in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has elapsed and the person ’ s current personality (see Gardel, cited above, § 68)."

It would therefore appear pointless for the applicant to search the archives for information about the ethnic origin of his ancestors. The Court notes that the solution given in the case of Caragheorghi by the domestic courts appears, on the face of it, to be at odds with the provisions of section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status (see paragraph 16 above), a provision to which the Supreme Court of Justice made express reference when dismissing the applicant's appeal on points of law (see paragraph 13 above).

He argued that according to the law of Romania, Romanian citizenship was issued to former Romanian citizens and their descendants irrespective of ethnic origin. The applicant contended that the State had placed on him an excessive and insurmountable burden by requesting documentary evidence of his Romanian origin in circumstances in which it was common ground that almost all the representatives of the majority ethnic group had been deliberately recorded as ethnic Moldovans during the Soviet era.

The Government submitted that the applicant was the only person who had ever instituted proceedings with a view to changing his ethnic identity from Moldovan to Romanian. They had to rely therefore on a similar case concerning other ethnic identities, namely on the domestic judgment in the case of Caragheorghi, where a person had been able to have his ethnic identity changed from Gagauz to Greek on the basis of evidence proving the Greek ethnic identity of one of his ancestors ( see paragraph 22 above ). At the same time they drew attention to section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status, which clearly stated that it was impossible to rectify the ethnic identity of one's parents in their children's birth certificates, on the basis of identity papers of grandparents or other ascendants, if the parents'civil status documents did not contain information concerning the requested ethnic identity."

In the Government's view such a situation could constitute an abuse in respect of other countries. The Government suggested that the applicant's desire to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian might be motivated by his intention to obtain Romanian citizenship and argued that it was within the Government's margin of appreciation to determine the extent to which requests concerning changes in records concerning ethnic origin could be accepted.

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Y.F. v. Turkey, no. 24209/94, § 33, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ). The notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees provided for by Article 8. Under this principle protection is given to the personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of their identity as individual human beings (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ). The Court has held that gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life were details pertaining to an individual's identity falling within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). In a more recent judgment, in the case of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, 4 December 2008 ), the Court further held that ethnic identity was also a detail pertaining to the individual's identity falling within the ambit of Article 8."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. There may, in addition to this primary negative undertaking, be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). The boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under this provision do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, and in both contexts the State is recognised as enjoying a certain margin of appreciation (see Paulík v. Slovakia, no. 10699/05, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI (extracts) )."

Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32 ). Whilst Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, it is important for the effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by this provision that the relevant decision ‑ making process is fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by it. Such a process may require the existence of an effective procedural framework whereby an applicant can assert his or her rights under Article 8 under conditions of fairness, including as regards matters of proof and evidence. The Court recalls in this latter connection that in the case of I. v. Finland ( no. 20511/03, § 44, 17 July 2008 ) in finding a violation of Article 8 of the Convention the Court gave weight to the fact that the State had placed too heavy a burden of proof on the applicant in civil proceedings in which she sought compensation for the dissemination of information about her medical condition."

As noted above, along with such aspects as name, gender, religion and sexual orientation, an individual's ethnic identity constitutes an essential aspect of his or her private life and identity. This must be particularly true in the current social setting of the Republic of Moldova, where the problem of ethnic identity has been the subject matter of social tension and heated debate for a long time and, more importantly, where an individual's recorded ethnic identity, unlike other recorded aspects of identity, is decisive for the determination of the ethnic identity of his or her children and of the next generations. Accordingly, the facts of the present case fall within the ambit of “private life” under Article 8 of the Convention and since the authorities refused to record the applicant's declared ethnic identity, he may claim to be a victim of a breach of the provisions of this Article.

In the instant case, however, the applicant appears to have been confronted with a legal requirement which made it impossible for him to adduce any evidence in support of his claim. This is precisely because section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status and the current practice of recording ethnic identity create insurmountable barriers for someone wishing to have recorded an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his or her parents by the Soviet authorities. According to this section the applicant could change his ethnic identity only if he could show that one of his parents had been recorded as being of Romanian ethnicity in the official records, which represented a disproportionate burden in view of the historical realities of the Republic of Moldova (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

In this connection, the Court considers that the journalists of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meetings with A.C., who would have been entitled to feel deceived. The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council emphasised that the second and third videos were recorded by the journalists with a view to exercising pressure on A.C. and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this, other than claiming that recording A.C. with a hidden camera had been necessary, as he would never have consented to being filmed."

In the Court ’ s view, the journalists of the television show, as professionals, must have been aware of the relevant legislative provisions and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethics but also of criminal law. Therefore, such a breach can only be regarded as deliberate, irrespective of the veracity of the relevant information ( which was not disputed )."

The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council based its decision on the above-mentioned considerations and accordingly sanctioned the applicant company for its use of a hidden camera which resulted in an interference with A.C. ’ s right to his own image. From the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the Council attached significant weight to the “ entrapment ” of A.C. (see § 7 above). The same considerations apply to the Supreme Administrative Court which, without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos, ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information (compare Tierbefreier e.V. v. Germany, no. 45192/09, §§ 52  56, 16 January 2014). The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of A.C. In the Court ’ s view, the domestic authorities ’ conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable, at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned. In this connection, the Court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past. However, as regards the first video, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place, an element which, in the Court ’ s view, weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy A.C. might have had when he entered the gambling arcade."

In that case, the Court took into account the fact that the applicants had taken every measure to protect the broker ’ s image by pixellating his image and altering his voice. In the present case, however, it is clear that the applicant company made no effort to compensate for the intrusion into A.C. ’ s private life; on the contrary, his conduct had been the central subject matter of the videos, while the conduct of the journalists in the present case suggests that the breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics and of the Criminal Code was deliberate."

As can be seen from the minutes of the meeting, the applicant company ’ s attorneys acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the above-mentioned incidents. They argued that such use had been justified owing to A.C. being a public figure and that it had served the public interest, as proven by the fact that the report had resulted in A.C. ’ s being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy. In their view, that had been the result not only of A.C. ’ s gambling activities, but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company ’ s reporters to present the incident differently. The applicant company ’ s attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise, as nobody would have believed the journalists ’ allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images. It can also be seen from the minutes that the members of the National Radio and Television Council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera, arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so, then all citizens – especially if they were public figures – would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion. They furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue; however the means used raised an issue, as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations. They also noted that there were two separate issues in the instant case; on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of A.C."

It additionally referred to the Court ’ s case-law in respect of Article 10 and on Article 8, with specific reference to case-law concerning the protection of a person ’ s image ( see Von Hannover v.

                "13. The Supreme Administrative Court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera, by making a distinction between reporting on specific news, whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means, and the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded image. According to that reasoning, recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person ’ s right to his own image, which is protected by Articles 9 § 1 of the Constitution and 8 § 1 of the Convention, as a specific aspect of the right to respect for one ’ s private life. Consequently, the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means cannot, in principle, be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individual ’ s right to his own image. Nevertheless, in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news, on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person ’ s position or standing. However, even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded images, as that constitutes a much more intense [ έντονος ] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news. In the domestic court ’ s view, broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate (for the reasons mentioned above) broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news."

By applying the above-mentioned principles to the circumstances of the case, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant company ’ s argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning A.C. in view of A.C. ’ s capacity as a public figure. The domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the National Radio and Television Council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news, whose source had been the secretly recorded images. As far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned, the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images. Therefore, the applicant company ’ s allegation that it had broadcast the impugned images for reasons of journalistic interest and of public interest was dismissed."

A concurring, more specific ( ειδικότερη ) opinion was joined to the majority opinion; the seven judges considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that person ’ s right to dignity as it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goals that are irrelevant to him. Given that, pursuant to Articles 2 § 1, 15 § 2 and 25 § 1 of the Constitution, the protection of human dignity is absolute, the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden, irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question. For those reasons, the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed."

According to the first one, in view of the fact that the National Radio and Television Council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image. The reason for this was the special nature of television, in comparison with the other media, owing to which the broadcasting of the image went hand-in-hand with broadcasting the news itself. Therefore, the application for annulment should have been allowed, given that the National Radio and Television Council ’ s decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of A.C. had been recorded by hidden means, without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information."
            ],
            [
                "18. Lastly, according to the other dissenting opinion, no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image ( as was held by the majority ). A person ’ s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person ’ s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place. For individuals, protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute, irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space, unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space. For public figures, however, protection was less absolute. In particular, public figures, such as politicians, were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it. As a result, there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities. For these persons, there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments. When, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public ), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media. In this regard, the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television, as they did not operate on the same way; therefore, it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images, as would be the case on the radio. In respect of legitimately recorded images, when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person ’ s image on the other hand, the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent. In view of the above, the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed, taking into account especially the fact that A.C. was a public figure, that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space ( that is to say in a gambling arcade ), and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of Parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position. Therefore, the television channel ’ s decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows, which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory, had not breached the proportionality principle."

The applicant company maintained that the decision of the National Radio and Television Council to impose administrative sanctions on it on account of the three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera and broadcast in two of its television shows had violated its right to freedom of expression. In particular, the applicant company argued that the fines imposed on it, specifically EUR 100,000 in respect of each of the two television shows during which the videos had been broadcast – as well as the obligation to broadcast the content of the above-mentioned decision – had interfered with its right to freedom of expression and in particular with its right to impart information."

The applicant company argued that the images recorded by the use of a hidden camera concerned the behaviour of a public figure who had been at the time a member of the Hellenic Parliament and chairman of the inter-party committee on the widespread use of electronic gambling. Therefore his participation in gambling games had been a matter of public interest in the light of A.C. ’ s public role and could have affected his duties as a member of parliament and as chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling. Viewers had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy. In any event, electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in Greece at the time as many citizens had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar games. That had been the reason why the two television shows had prepared the broadcasts in question. In view of the above, the broadcasting of videos that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary, and A.C. ’ s right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant company ’ s right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest. Both the National Radio and Television Council ( which had imposed the administrative sanctions ) and the Supreme Administrative Court ( which had dismissed the application for annulment ) had failed in the present case to strike a fair balance between the applicant company ’ s right under Article 10 and A.C. ’ s right under Article 8 of the Convention."

In the applicant company ’ s view, such behaviour on the part of a public figure had had to be exposed; therefore, the broadcasting of that video had been necessary and had fulfilled part of the applicant company ’ s duty to inform the public, pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention."

The same considerations applied to the second video; the sanctions had been imposed because of the broadcasting of the images and not because of the transmission of the news of the meeting that had taken place between A.C. and the television station ’ s reporters."

In respect of the necessity of the alleged interference, the Government stressed that all three videos had been filmed by illegitimate means, namely a hidden camera, without the consent and knowledge of A.C. and in violation of the relevant legislation. In addition, the images on all three videos, as well as the filmed conversations of A.C. with journalists on the second and third videos, had breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A § 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the above-mentioned provisions of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned videos. In the Government ’ s view, the applicant company had not advanced any argument as to why the broadcasting of the videos had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the videos that had been recorded in violation of A.C. ’ s right to his own image. The videos had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the public ’ s curiosity and had been used as a means of securing higher ratings for the programmes; this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In view of the above, the National Radio and Television Council – which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the videos that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanctions on the applicant company – had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. Referring to the Court ’ s case-law ( Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2016), the Government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from Article 8 in order to effectively protect A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In addition, it had been in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalists were not obliged to respect national legislation and the Code on Journalistic Ethics. The alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need – namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of means which harmed the reputation and image of individuals unless such means contributing to a public debate."

In addition, national legislation provided for far more severe sanctions than the ones imposed on the applicant company.",

                "45. The Court notes that account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved. Because of their direct, continuous contact with the realities of the country, a State ’ s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. For this reason, in matters under Article 10 of the Convention, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that Article in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests (see, among other authorities, Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 54, ECHR 2011). However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it – even those delivered by an independent court. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court ’ s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on. If the balance struck by the national judicial authorities is unsatisfactory, in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental rights at stake was not duly considered, the margin of appreciation accorded to the decisions of the national courts will be a narrow one (see Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 4149/04 and 41029/04, § 67, ECHR 2012 ). Where, however, the exercise of striking a balance between two conflicting rights was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, §§ 104 ‑ 107, and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, §§ 90-92)."

Accordingly, although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photographs, the Court recalls that this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance, especially where the images contain very personal and intimate “information” about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ) v.

The extent to which an individual has a public profile or is well-known influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life. Thus, the Court has acknowledged on numerous occasions that the public was entitled to be informed about certain aspects of the private life of public figures (see, inter alia, Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v.

The domestic authorities ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life ( ibid., § 124). The Court notes that the domestic authorities did not explicitly address this point. In fact, the National Radio and Television Council in its decision made no reference to A.C. ’ s public functions but merely referred to the relevant legislative provisions which provide the general protection of the right to private life and one ’ s right to one ’ s own image. The Supreme Administrative Court, however, stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact, in the light of the status or position of the person concerned (see paragraph 14 above), although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far as broadcasting the impugned videos was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authorities ’ conclusions, notably that the news whose source was the videos that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast, those authorities took into account A.C. ’ s public functions (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 3), no. 8772/10, § 55, 19 September 2013).

This is corroborated by the fact that all three videos were focused on A.C. and his reaction to the first video, which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machines.

Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, § § 61 and 63-68, 19 April 2011; and Times Newspapers Ltd v. the United Kingdom (nos. 1 and 2), nos. 3002/03 and 23676/03, § 42, ECHR 2009)."

                "60. However, the concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the contents of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces, inter alia, the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions. The fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly (see Pentikäinen, cited above, § 90)."

            [
                "61. The Court reiterates in this context that journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake “duties and responsibilities” (see Stoll, cited above, § 102, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49 in fine, Series A no. 24). It will be recalled in this connection that paragraph 2 of Article 10 does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression, even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern. In particular, and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society, journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that, as journalists, Article 10 affords them a cast-iron defence (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, § 102; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 65; and Monnat v. Switzerland, no. 73604/01, § 66, ECHR 2006-X). In other words, a journalist cannot claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that, unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression, the offence in question was committed during the performance of his or her journalistic functions (see Pentikäinen, cited above, § 91)."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that both parties agreed in substance that the use of a hidden camera was not absolutely prohibited in domestic law, but that it could be accepted, subject to strict conditions. It was not disputed among the parties that pursuant to Article 9 § 1 of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, the use of this technique was permitted only where there was an overriding public interest in the dissemination of the relevant information, provided that the collection of the information did not violate a person ’ s dignity. The Court has already established that the report concerned a matter of public interest. It considers that what is important at this stage is an assessment of the conduct of the applicant company ’ s employees."

Therefore, the applicant company ’ s employees recorded the first video in a public space – that is to say a place accessible to anyone. By contrast, the second video was recorded in unknown premises and showed journalists of the television show projecting the first video to A.C.

In the Court ’ s view, however, there are significant differences between the circumstances under which the first video was filmed on the one hand and those under which the second and third videos were filmed on the other hand. Without a doubt, the use of a hidden camera in this case raises serious issues under the relevant Greek legislation in respect of all three videos. Nevertheless, the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or – as in the instant case – filmed a video of the member of the Parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists ’ conduct. The Court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of Article 8, albeit in a different context, that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person ’ s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX)."

On the contrary, as regards the second and third videos, the Court considers that, in light of the clear position under Greek criminal law, A.C. was entitled to have an expectation of privacy as he entered private spaces with a view to discussing the recorded incidents and for his conversations not to be recorded without his explicit consent. In this connection, the Court considers that the journalists of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meetings with A.C., who would have been entitled to feel deceived. The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council emphasised that the second and third videos were recorded by the journalists with a view to exercising pressure on A.C. and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this, other than claiming that recording A.C. with a hidden camera had been necessary, as he would never have consented to being filmed."

In addition, as the Government pointed out, the journalists working in the applicant company breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A § 2 of the Criminal Code, which protects the confidentiality of conversations. In the Court ’ s view, the journalists of the television show, as professionals, must have been aware of the relevant legislative provisions and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethics but also of criminal law. Therefore, such a breach can only be regarded as deliberate, irrespective of the veracity of the relevant information ( which was not disputed )."

The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council based its decision on the above-mentioned considerations and accordingly sanctioned the applicant company for its use of a hidden camera which resulted in an interference with A.C. ’ s right to his own image. From the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the Council attached significant weight to the “ entrapment ” of A.C. (see § 7 above). The same considerations apply to the Supreme Administrative Court which, without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos, ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information (compare Tierbefreier e.V. v. Germany, no. 45192/09, §§ 52  56, 16 January 2014). The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of A.C. In the Court ’ s view, the domestic authorities ’ conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable, at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned. In this connection, the Court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past. However, as regards the first video, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place, an element which, in the Court ’ s view, weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy A.C. might have had when he entered the gambling arcade."

In that case, the Court took into account the fact that the applicants had taken every measure to protect the broker ’ s image by pixellating his image and altering his voice. In the present case, however, it is clear that the applicant company made no effort to compensate for the intrusion into A.C. ’ s private life; on the contrary, his conduct had been the central subject matter of the videos, while the conduct of the journalists in the present case suggests that the breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics and of the Criminal Code was deliberate."

The third video concerned a meeting between A.C. and M.T. in the latter ’ s office. The content of the second and third videos has not been described in detail to the Court by the parties; however, from the applicant company ’ s submissions ( which have not been refuted by the Government ), it appears that in the meetings recorded on those videos, A.C. was shown trying to convince the journalists to present the first video as an experiment connected with his parliamentary duties; in exchange he offered to appear live on television."

On the basis of the above- mentioned considerations, it imposed on the applicant company the relevant sanctions, namely EUR 100,000 euros in respect of each of the two television shows during which the impugned videos were broadcast and the obligation to disseminate the content of the decision. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the relevant sanctions, considering that they were proportionate and that the lack of specific details regarding the number of viewers or the size of the investment the applicant company had made did not have any impact on the proportionality of the sanctions. It further took into account the fact that Article 4 § 1 of Law no. 2328/1995 provided for far stricter penalties ( including fines as high as EUR 1,467,351.43 and the temporary suspension or even the indefinite interruption of the broadcasting of a television show ) than those imposed on the applicant company.

In particular, the domestic authorities acknowledged that the news whose source was the impugned videos had been legitimately disseminated but considered that the videos had constituted a substantially more far- reaching interference with A.C. ’ s right to his image. This conclusion was in line with the Court ’ s case-law, according to which, even though freedom of expression extends to the publication of photographs, this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance, especially where the images contain very personal and intimate “information” about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS), cited above, § 47; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 143)."

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82; Rotaru v.

The disclosure had been excessive in view of the negative medical consequences for the applicants. The prosecutor’s interference had seriously complicated the second applicant’s treatment process and obstructed the use of alternative non-blood methods of treatment, including erythropoietin. The attitude of the medical personnel towards her had noticeably deteriorated. Besides, on 18 September 2007 an article had appeared in the media in which one of the doctors openly discussed the second applicant’s case.

The disclosures had been carried out within the framework of the inquiry carried out by the prosecutor’s office.

The Court reiterates that the protection of personal data, including medical information, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of the right to respect for his or her private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The disclosure of such data may seriously affect a person’s private and family life, as well as their social and employment situation, by exposing them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, §§ 95-96, Reports 1997-I). Respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient’s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person’s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health (see Z., cited above, § 95, and Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 43, 25 November 2008). Nevertheless, the interests of a patient and the community as a whole in protecting the confidentiality of medical data may be outweighed by the interest of investigating and prosecuting crime and in the publicity of court proceedings, where such interests are shown to be of even greater importance (see, Z ., cited above, § 97)."

The Court further reiterates that in cases concerning the disclosure of personal data, it has recognised that a margin of appreciation should be left to the competent national authorities in striking a fair balance between the relevant conflicting public and private interests. However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision (see Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A, p. 24, § 55) and the scope of this margin depends on such factors as the nature and seriousness of the interests at stake and the gravity of the interference (see Z, cited above, § 99)."

The prosecutor merely conducted an inquiry into the activities of the applicants’ religious organisation in response to complaints received by his office. The medical facilities where the applicants underwent treatment did not report any instances of alleged criminal behaviour to the prosecutor’s office. In particular, it was open to the medical professionals providing treatment to the second applicant, who was two years old at the time, to apply or to ask the prosecutor to apply for judicial authorisation for a blood transfusion if they believed her to be in a life-threatening situation. Likewise, there is nothing in the materials before the Court to suggest that the doctors who reported the fourth applicant’s case to the District Prosecutor opined that her refusal of a blood transfusion was not an expression of her true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on her by other adherents of her religious beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, §§ 137-38). In such circumstances, the Court does not discern any pressing social need for requesting the disclosure of the confidential medical information concerning the applicants. It therefore considers that the means employed by the prosecutor in conducting the inquiry need not have been so oppressive for the applicants."

In particular, he could have tried to obtain the applicants’ consent for the disclosure and/or questioned them in relation to the matter (see paragraphs 23-24 above). Nevertheless, the prosecutor chose to order the disclosure of the confidential medical information without giving the applicants any notice or an opportunity to object or to agree."

The Government did not deny that the law placed no specific limits on the prosecutor’s authority to obtain a person’s medical records.

After evaluating the surveillance file it found that the medical reports contradicted the images and videos showing the applicant walking her dog, driving a car long distances, going shopping, carrying groceries and opening the boot of the car by moving her arms above her head without noticeable restrictions or unusual behaviour. Moreover, it found that there were discrepancies, not only between the results of the surveillance and the medical reports but also between the medical reports which had been drafted before the surveillance. Finally, the examination of the applicant by a neurologist was necessary and admissible because she had previously refused to undergo an assessment of her functional capacities and a neurological examination, which were required in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Federal Court denied the probative value not only of the medical reports attesting to the applicant ’ s complete incapacity to work but also of the reports attesting to her incapacity to work of a lesser degree. Therefore, the insurance company had acted correctly in ordering a reassessment of her ability to work through a critical review of all previous medical reports.

As such, it is considered a public authority within the meaning of Article 1 § 2 ( e ) VwVG ... To the extent that it can deliver binding decisions to insured persons, and thus exercises sovereign powers, it has to respect not only the procedural guarantees of administrative law, but also general constitutional principles, in particular fundamental rights. ...",
                "4.3 The aim of surveillance of an insured person by private detectives is to collect and confirm facts which materialise in the public domain and may be observed by anyone (for example, walking, climbing stairs, driving, carrying loads or performing sports activities). Even when the surveillance is ordered by an authority, it does not give the person undertaking the surveillance the right to interfere with the privacy of the insured person. Unlike a judicially ordered surveillance – for instance, in the context of the Federal Act of 6 October 2000 on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (BÜPF; SR 780.1) – the protection of the insured person from crime remains intact, since private detectives acting on the strength of an administrative order are not allowed to commit criminal acts. In particular, the person in charge of the surveillance has to keep to the framework set up by Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In contrast to a covert investigation pursuant to the Federal Law of 20 June 2003 on the undercover investigation ... it is not the purpose of such surveillance for the investigating person to create links with the person subject to the surveillance so as to penetrate into their environment ...",

It must, however, be examined whether these provisions are sufficiently clear to serve as a legal basis within the meaning of Article 36 § 1 [of the Constitution].",

Part of the literature represents the view that surveillance which is limited to such an extent does not even affect the scope of the fundamental right of privacy ( Ueli Kieser, supra). The core content of Article 13 [of the Constitution] is not affected by the institution of such surveillance. In principle, information obtained from insured persons, their employers and healthcare professionals is sufficient for a reliable assessment of claims for benefits; further investigation by a private detective is indicated only in a vanishingly small percentage of persons registered with accident insurance cases ... Ordering of secret surveillance is thus of an exceptional nature, as it will only take place if the other clarification measures fail to produce a conclusive result. The overall legal basis for the restriction of the fundamental rights of insured persons is thus sufficiently precise ...",

The probative value of the records and reports of private investigators can, however, only be granted in so far as they indicate activities and actions which the insured person has exercised without being influenced by those engaging in the surveillance ... ”",

Surveillance by a private investigator was requested only in a small proportion of cases when other measures of examination had proved inconclusive and the insured person had not fulfilled her or his obligation to provide the requested information.

The law only vaguely defined that surveillance could be carried out when it seemed to be “objectively justified”, but did not specify this concept further.

As to the first condition, surveillance would be permissible virtually any time that a victim of a traffic accident claimed a large amount in damages, which was usually the case. As to the second condition, the applicant pointed out that the findings of the medical reports did not depend on the victim of the accident, but on the medical experts in charge, who had often been commissioned by the insurance company itself."

In particular, the Federal Court repeatedly recognised that Article 43, read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act formed a sufficient legal basis for the surveillance of an insured person. The said provisions prescribed surveillance as a measure of last resort used when the insured person did not comply with her or his obligation to provide information requested and the insurance company had to process certain data necessary for it to perform the tasks assigned to it in domestic law. The law allowed the collection of data only in public spaces for a limited period of time and made it available only to a restricted number of persons."

Insured persons were protected against the abuse of surveillance measures by a number of domestic law provisions, namely Article 28 of the Civil Code and Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In particular, it was forbidden to contact the insured person in order to interfere with her or his life, surveillance could be performed only for a limited period of time, and collected data could be seen only by a small number of people for the fulfilment of the insurer ’ s legal tasks."

It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring it to be accessible to the person concerned, who must, moreover, be able to foresee its consequences for him. It must also be compatible with the rule of law (see, among many other authorities, Rotaru v.

Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, § 229, 4 December 2015). Foreseeability in that specific context cannot mean that individuals should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to resort to secret surveillance so that they can adapt their conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances and conditions under which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 51, Series A no. 116; Uzun, cited above, §§ 61-63; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v.

In view of the risk of abuse intrinsic to any system of secret surveillance, such measures must be based on a law that is particularly precise, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated (see Uzun, cited above, § 61)."

In addition, in the context of secret measures of surveillance by public authorities, because of the lack of public scrutiny and the risk of abuse of power, compatibility with the rule of law requires domestic law to provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights. The Court ’ s assessment in this respect depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Uzun, cited above, § 63 ).",

Turning to the present case, it is not in dispute that the surveillance measure applied to the applicant was based on Article 43 read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act (see § § 3 8 and 40 above). These articles, read together, provide that when an insured person does not comply with the obligation to submit the requested information, insurance companies are allowed to take of their own motion the necessary investigative measures and collect necessary information. In particular, they are allowed to process and require to have processed personal data, including sensitive data and personality profiles necessary in order to establish rights to benefits and to calculate, allocate and coordinate them with those from other social insurance funds."

In the Court ’ s view, the said expressions did not seem to either expressly include or even imply the recording of images or videos among the investigative measures that could be deployed by insurance companies. However, it observes that the domestic courts, which are primarily called upon to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998 ‑ II), concluded that the said provisions covered surveillance in such circumstances (see §§ 35 and 43 above)."

Furthermore, in the absence of any details as regards the maximum duration of the surveillance measures or the possibility of their judicial challenge, insurance companies (acting as public authorities) were granted a wide discretion in deciding which circumstances justified such surveillance and for how long. It can thus not be said that the domestic law had set a strict standard for authorising the surveillance measure at issue (see, a contrario, Uzun, cited above, § 70)."

In the Government ’ s view, this placed in context the need for clarity and precision of the legal basis of the surveillance in question. While the Court can agree that surveillance in the present case must be considered to interfere less with a person ’ s private life than, for instance, telephone tapping, it nonetheless has to adhere to general principles on adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights as summarised above (see § 68 above; see also Uzun, cited above, §§ 66 and 72 )."

In particular, it did not, as required by the Court ’ s case-law, set out sufficient safeguards against abuse.

On appeal, the Federal Court concluded that, under its own jurisprudence, the surveillance had not been unlawful, and so it took the surveillance report into evidence. It followed that the applicant had had the opportunity to challenge the impugned evidence and oppose its use in adversarial proceedings. Moreover, in their reasoned decision, the domestic courts gave ample consideration to the applicant ’ s request in this respect."

The Court further observes that the impugned recording, together with the expert opinion issued on the basis of the surveillance, was not the only evidence relied on by the Federal Court as the basis for its decision in the applicant ’ s case. As evident from the Federal Court ’ s reasoning, that court took into consideration other available evidence, in particular the existing contradictions between the medical reports drawn up prior to the surveillance (see § 3 5 above)."
