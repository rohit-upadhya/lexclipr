The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA), whereas if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

The latter remedy was more focused on the problem of noise nuisance and was thus more appropriate for the applicant ’ s complaints. Furthermore, the applicant had failed to lodge a request with the local administration for a reduction in the working hours of the bar and the shop, which would have eliminated noise nuisance during the night. In any event, the Government considered that the applicant ’ s complaints were premature, since a number of proceedings before the competent domestic authorities, namely the sanitary inspector, the County Office, various inspectorates, and the Administrative Court, were still pending.

In addition, the expert report commissioned during the civil proceedings confirmed that the noise in the applicant ’ s flat did not exceed permitted levels, and in that regard the applicant had all the procedural guarantees of a fair trial to challenge the findings. The Government also pointed out that the expert reports had not found the level of any other emissions affecting the applicant ’ s flat excessive.

This leads to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used as a residential property, and that the maximum noise level under the by- law should be 45 dB (see paragraph 110 above and zone 3 of table no. 1 of the by-law ) applicable to premises predominantly used as dwellings. This approach, considering the applicant ’ s house to fall within zone 3 under table no. 1 of the by-law, was later used in two reports on noise measurements (see paragraphs 69 and 82 above).

The first report found that when chairs were being dragged across the floor inside the bar during the day the level of noise in the applicant ’ s flat on the ground floor exceeded the permitted level by 11 dB and in the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor by 4 dB. During the night the level of noise in the entrance to the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor exceeded the permitted level by 2 dB while all sources of noise in the bar were switched on and while only the air-conditioning fan was running in the bar. Inside the living room the level of noise during the night was over the limit by 3 dB when the sources of noise were turned on and when the fan was running, and by 13 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar. The level of noise inside the flat on the ground floor was over the limit by 4 dB while the sources of noise were switched on and by 16 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar (see paragraph 63 above). Moreover, these measurements show that the level of noise exceeded the relevant international standards for noise levels (see paragraph 114 above, and compare Oluić, cited above, §§ 54-60). The report of 7 March 2008 drawn up by company B-I., which was focused on the improvements to the air-conditioning system in the bar, found that the level of noise was not excessive; that was also confirmed by company E. (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above). However, since there are no indications that at that point any improvements to the noise insulation in the flooring of the bar had been made, and in fact in November 2008 the noise insulation was found to be insufficient (see paragraph 48 above), it could be concluded that the noise created by dragging the chairs across the floor inside the bar remained excessive. Such noise, given the extent to which it exceeded the permitted levels and the fact that it was pervasive in the ordinary regular activities of the customers of the bar, must have disturbed the amenity of the applicant ’ s everyday life."

While the first measurements, taken on 24 November 2008, showed that the noise insulation was not adequate, the second measurements of 13 February 2009 showed that the noise insulation was sufficient. However, the latter findings were not based on any noise insulation standards, since such standards did not exist at the time (see paragraph 52 above).

The allegation that the damage to the house had been caused by vibration was disputed by the Government with reference to a competent authority ’ s opinion and has never been confirmed by an independent expert. Insofar as the applicant ’ s parents ’ health can fall within the scope of her family life under Article 8, the case file contains medical evidence that they suffer from numerous illnesses.

It is not implausible in these circumstances that the applicant was regularly disturbed by noise and vibration, at least to some extent. Further, more than half of the examined vehicles were found to be emitting pollutants in excess of applicable safety standards. The level of air and soil pollution was assessed by the domestic environmental health authorities as necessitating the suspension of the use of the road, on pain of risk of adverse impact on the residents ’ health ( see paragraph 19 above). The polluting substances emitted by the vehicles included copper and lead, an excessive level of which was also found in the soil near the applicant ’ s house. In light of these findings, the Court considers it particularly notable that the applicant ’ s son was diagnosed in 2002 with chronic lead and copper salts poisoning. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any evidence disproving the authenticity and accuracy of this diagnosis and have not proposed any plausible alternative explanation concerning the origin of this poisoning to counter the applicant ’ s allegation that it was directly connected to the motorway ’ s operation."

Pollution and other nuisances had remained unchecked for several years in a row, and it had only been following multiple complaints from the street ’ s residents that in May 2002 the level of pollution had been checked and the decision to suspend the traffic had been taken. Moreover, the street ’ s residents had had to engage in mass protests in order to have this decision eventually enforced. In any event, although the traffic had been stopped, no measures to repair the deteriorated road surface or clean up the soil had ever been implemented."

They alleged, firstly, that there had been insufficient evidence that the applicant ’ s suffering had reached the threshold necessary for bringing Article 8 of the Convention into play. The damage to the house from vibration had been confirmed by a group of assessors who had not been qualified to come to such conclusions. On the other hand, a qualified representative of the Housing Maintenance department had opined during the court hearings that the house had more likely been flawed upon its initial construction. There had likewise been no conclusive evidence concerning a correlation between the motorway ’ s operation and the health problems suffered by the members of the applicant ’ s family. The Government also contested, without providing evidence, the accuracy of the medical certificates issued by the City Hospital, alleging that they were prepared by the applicant ’ s sister. Moreover, there had been other sources of pollution in the area, such as burning spoil heaps from coal-mining activity. Overall, a considerable part of Ukraine suffers from various environmental problems and there is no indication that the environmental burden suffered by the applicant ’ s family had been any heavier than that borne by the rest of the community."

The Government further contended that, even assuming that they had owed any duty vis-à-vis the applicant under Article 8 of the Convention, they had taken all reasonable actions to ensure a fair balance between her interests and those of the community. Firstly, K. Street had served as a through road since 1983. In 1998 the street ’ s status as part of the motorway had merely been confirmed during the stocktaking project. The Government should therefore not be held responsible for the decision to route the traffic via K. Street. Secondly, following the entry of the Convention into force, the authorities had been contemplating the construction of a new through road, bypassing residential streets. However, they had had no choice but to use the existing road until the necessary funding could be found, as closing it off would have caused considerable detriment to the economic well-being of the country. Contrary to the applicant ’ s argument, the use of the road had not been at odds with applicable law, because paragraph 1.9 of the State Construction Guidelines had recommended, but had not required, that major motorways be constructed outside populated communities."

                "57. The Government next argued that the pollution complained of had not been emitted by the State authorities ’ operation of the road, but rather by vehicles belonging to various owners. This pollution therefore could not qualify as State interference with the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights. Assuming the State had had a positive obligation to react to this pollution, it had done so by setting up a legislative scheme establishing safe pollution levels and a system to monitor compliance with that scheme. Once the State authorities had become aware that the road was not operating as intended, they had reacted quickly by closing it off to through traffic on 16 June 2002, more than a year before the applicant had applied to the Court."

Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § § 105-108, 10 February 2011 ) the Court reiterates that, where, as in the present case, the case concerns an environmental hazard, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise only where the hazard at issue attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant ’ s ability to enjoy her home, private or family life. The assessment of that minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual ’ s health or quality of life."

            [
                "59. In line with these principles, the Court must first consider whether the detriment suffered by the applicant on account of the operation of the M04 motorway starting from October 1998 was sufficiently serious to raise an issue under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaints concern, primarily, the level of noise, damage to her house from vibration and her sufferings on account of the deterioration of her parents ’ and her minor son ’ s health resulting from air and soil pollution."

            [
                "60. The Court considers that there is insufficient evidence to prove all the applicant ’ s allegations ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’. In particular, the noise levels and their impact on the applicant ’ s private and family life have never been measured (see a contrario Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, § 23, 9 November 2010 ). The allegation that the damage to the house had been caused by vibration was disputed by the Government with reference to a competent authority ’ s opinion and has never been confirmed by an independent expert. Insofar as the applicant ’ s parents ’ health can fall within the scope of her family life under Article 8, the case file contains medical evidence that they suffer from numerous illnesses. However, based on this evidence, it is not possible to determine to what extent these illnesses have been caused or aggravated by the operation of the motorway. As regards the health of the applicant ’ s minor son, it appears that he already suffered from immunodeficiency before October 1998 and that in his doctors ’ opinion he had resided in an ‘ environmentally saturated area ’ from his birth in 1994 (see paragraph 17 above)."

At the same time, the Court notes that according to the official investigation of 15 May 2002 ( see paragraph 12 above ), the surface of the road near the applicant ’ s house was severely damaged and more than one hundred vehicles drove over it during one hour. It is not implausible in these circumstances that the applicant was regularly disturbed by noise and vibration, at least to some extent. Further, more than half of the examined vehicles were found to be emitting pollutants in excess of applicable safety standards. The level of air and soil pollution was assessed by the domestic environmental health authorities as necessitating the suspension of the use of the road, on pain of risk of adverse impact on the residents ’ health ( see paragraph 19 above). The polluting substances emitted by the vehicles included copper and lead, an excessive level of which was also found in the soil near the applicant ’ s house. In light of these findings, the Court considers it particularly notable that the applicant ’ s son was diagnosed in 2002 with chronic lead and copper salts poisoning. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any evidence disproving the authenticity and accuracy of this diagnosis and have not proposed any plausible alternative explanation concerning the origin of this poisoning to counter the applicant ’ s allegation that it was directly connected to the motorway ’ s operation."

                "62. Regard being had to the above data, the Court considers that the cumulative effect of noise, vibration and air and soil pollution generated by the M04 motorway significantly deterred the applicant from enjoying her rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 is therefore applicable in the present case."

            [
                "63. In view of the above, the Court will next examine, in the light of the principles developed in its jurisprudence (see, among other authorities, Dubetska, cited above, §§ 140- 145) whether the Government have provided sufficient evidence to justify a situation in which the applicant bore a heavy burden on behalf of the rest of the community."
            ],

                "64. The Court firstly notes that, as submitted by the Government, on 16 June 2002, within one month of the investigation by the environmental health authorities, K. Street was closed off to through traffic. Lacking concrete data, and, in particular, texts of relevant domestic decisions (if any) in evidence of the applicant ’ s allegations that this decision was in fact enforced at an unspecified later date or that the traffic was eventually restarted, the Court will proceed from the assumption that through traffic was stopped on the date suggested by the Government (see, mutatis mutandis, Vinokurov v. Russia and Ukraine ( dec .), no. 2937/04, 16 October 2007). Consequently, it must be noted that the issues of noise, vibration, air and soil pollution connected to its functioning were redressed. It, however, remains to be examined whether the State authorities should still be liable for the adverse effects of the motorway ’ s operation between October 1998 and June 2002."
            ],
            [
                "65. In assessing this matter, the Court recognises the complexity of the State ’ s tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. Being mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, on many occasions the Court has emphasized that the States should enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation in the complex sphere of environmental policymaking ( see, for example, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 100, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). While the authorities of the Member States are increasingly taking on responsibility for minimising or controlling pollution, Article 8 cannot be construed as requiring them to ensure that every individual enjoys housing that meets particular environmental standards (see Ward v. the United Kingdom ( dec .), no. 31888/03, 9 November 2004). In line with these considerations, the Court considers that it would be going too far to render the Government responsible for the very fact of allowing cross-town through traffic to pass through a populated street or establish the applicant ’ s general right to free, new housing at the State ’ s expense. All the more so, given that the applicant in the present case has not argued that her house has decreased in value since October 1998 or that she has otherwise been unable to sell it and relocate without the State ’ s support (see, a contrario, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 121, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV )."

                "66. While the Court finds no reason to reassess the substance of the Government ’ s decision to allow the use of K. Street as a through road, in examining the procedural aspect of relevant policymaking, the Court is not convinced that minimal safeguards to ensure a fair balance between the applicant ’ s and the community ’ s interests were put in place."
            ],
            [
                "67. It notes, firstly, that the Government have not shown that the 1998 decision to route motorway M04 via K. Street was preceded by an adequate feasibility study, assessing the probability of compliance with applicable environmental standards and enabling interested parties, including K. Street ’ s residents, to contribute their views ( see, a contrario, Hatton, cited above, § 128 ). On the contrary, the nature of this decision and the adequacy of attenuating procedures appear quite ambiguous, particularly in light of the Government ’ s disagreement with the applicant as to whether the 1998 decision re-routed the traffic from P. Street to K. Street or merely confirmed K. Street ’ s earlier status as a through road. The Court considers, however, that even if K. Street had been used by through traffic before the 1998 stocktaking project, the State authorities were responsible for ensuring minimal procedural safeguards in this project ’ s course. Neither the domestic court decisions, nor the Government ’ s observations contain evidence that these safeguards, and particularly public access to relevant environmental information and decision-taking in the period of contemplating the stocktaking project, existed."
            ],
            [
                "68. Secondly, the Court considers that no later than the time of the 1998 stocktaking project, the authorities likewise became responsible for putting in place a reasonable policy for mitigating the motorway ’ s harmful effects on the Article 8 rights of K. Street ’ s residents (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 127-131 ). It appears that the municipal authorities did take some measures aimed at the street ’ s environmental management ( see paragraph 30 above). However, neither the assessment made by domestic courts in their judgments, nor the Government ’ s observations contain sufficient detail enabling the Court to conclude that this management was effective and meaningful before the measurement of critical pollution levels on 15 May 2002. As transpires from the available materials, this measurement session was carried out only in response to repeated complaints by K. Street ’ s residents, which, according to the case file, were initially lodged no later than in 2000."

                "69. Thirdly, emphasising the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making as a procedural safeguard for ensuring rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention, the Court underlines that an essential element of this safeguard is an individual ’ s ability to challenge an official act or omission affecting her rights in this sphere before an independent authority (see Dubetska, cited above, § 143 ). It also notes that as of 30 October 2001 the Aarhus Convention, which concerns access to information, participation of the public in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters has entered into force in respect of Ukraine (see paragraph 39 above). In the meantime, it has not been shown in the present case that the applicant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest the State authorities ’ policymaking regarding the M04 motorway during the period of October 1998 – June 2002 before the domestic courts."

As appears from the brief reasoning adduced by the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal for dismissing her claim ( see paragraph 33 above), its analysis was mostly limited to concluding that the defendant was not at all responsible for K. Street ’ s maintenance and repair. The Court notes that a variety of documents in the case file appear to pinpoint that such responsibility did – at least to some extent – in fact exist ( see paragraphs 24 ‑ 26, 30 and 34 above ), while the court ’ s reasoning does not contain any reference to the evidence which served as a basis for its contrary conclusion."

            [
                "71. Regardless, however, of which authority was responsible for the maintenance of K. Street ’ s road surface and other amenities, the Court finds it more important that the courts ’ reasoning does not contain a direct response to the applicant ’ s main arguments, on the basis of which she had sought to establish the Executive Committee ’ s liability. In particular, while the first-instance court questioned some witnesses as to some points of the municipality ’ s environmental policy, neither its, nor the higher courts ’ judgments contain any express assessment as to why they considered that this policy adequately protected the applicant ’ s rights. Likewise, no reasoning was provided for dismissing an allegation that the defendant ’ s decision taken in October 1998 was in and of itself unlawful and arbitrary, and it is unclear from the case file whether this aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint was at all studied during the proceedings at issue. The Court considers that the applicant ’ s arguments concerning the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of the above decision and the adequacy of the municipality ’ s environmental policy concerning K. Street were of paramount importance for resolving whether or not the defendant ’ s conduct struck a fair balance between the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 8 and the interests of the community. Lacking reasoning for the dismissal of these arguments in the texts of the domestic judgments, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to adduce her viewpoints before an independent authority."

Second, the Government did not show that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the related decision-making processes, including by challenging the municipal policies before an independent authority.

The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA) whereas, if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

These guideline values are set at the level of the lowest adverse health effect, meaning any temporary or long-term deterioration in physical, psychological or social functioning that is associated with noise exposure, and represent the sound pressure level which affects the most exposed receiver in a given environment."

In relation to noise levels in homes, the guidelines state that to protect the majority of people from being seriously annoyed during the daytime, the sound pressure level on balconies, terraces and in outdoor living areas should not exceed 55 dB LAeq for steady continuous noise and should not exceed 50 dB LAeq to protect people from being moderately annoyed. These values are based on annoyance studies but most European countries have adopted a 40 dB LAeq as the maximum allowable for new developments."

The applicant opted for the later. The Court notes that in the administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant she was able to seek the relevant expert measurements to be carried out and that the administrative bodies were empowered to issue decisions ordering the reduction of the noise level. In the Court's view the administrative remedy was hence able to address a situation of the violation alleged by the applicant.

The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person's home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person's right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003-VIII )."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it may involve the authorities ’ adopting measures designed to secure respect for private life and home, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 55). Thus, Article 8 may apply in environmental cases, whether the pollution is directly caused by the State or whether State responsibility arises from the failure to regulate private-sector activities properly. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants ’ rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention. Furthermore, even in relation to the positive obligations flowing from the first paragraph of Article 8, in striking the required balance the aims mentioned in the second paragraph may be of certain relevance (see Powell and Rayner, § 41, and López Ostra, § 51, both cited above)."

The Court accepts that in this context the authorities were entitled, having regard to the general nature of the measures taken, to identify distances from where third parties could perform the relevant displays, taking into account the geographical situation in Malta and its population density. The Court further accepts that it was justifiable to allow for the designation, as letting off sites, of areas in the rural zones, which were further away from densely inhabited areas, even though this might result in there being a shorter distance from other existing properties. As to the measurements applied, the Court notes that the security distance applicable to inhabited areas was that of 150 or 200 metres, according to the type of fireworks concerned. In the applicants ’ case, while no minimum distance was applicable, as they lived in an “ uninhabited ” area, in practice the actual distance between their home and the letting off zone was, as recognised by the parties, 150 metres. The Court, acknowledging that this might offer a lower degree of protection, notes that such a distance in principle still affords a certain degree of protection. Moreover, the application of this distance in practice and the lack of regulation in respect of distances applicable to uninhabited areas did not mean that the concerns of the people affected were totally disregarded."

Quite apart from the relevant procedure and requirements for the issuance of permits to allow such displays (see section 14 of the regulations), as submitted by the Government, regulations were in place in respect of transportation and unloading of fireworks. Such actions and the actual letting off of the fireworks were accordingly monitored by police inspectors and fire-fighters. Insurance covering the activity was also mandatory. Moreover, obligations were imposed on the third parties operating such displays (see section 17 of the regulations) and it has not been contended that the third parties failed to fulfil these obligations, in so far as it depended on them. Thus, in assessing whether the right balance has been struck, the availability of these measures to mitigate the effects of such displays is a relevant factor carrying considerable weight."

However, their house was one of three in the area and thus did not benefit from the protection of the law. Moreover, they claimed that the law was deficient, as it did not provide a procedure for issuing licences whereby the residents were informed and could make submissions to safeguard their interests, or appeal against the issue of such permits.

Although the effects of this pollution were not continuous, as in most cases which had been decided by the ECHR, the practice of letting off of fireworks would certainly continue and its effects on the applicants included damage and threats to their person and their home, as dangerous unexploded fireworks were often found in the surroundings. In consequence, the court considered that, while the legality of the issue of these permits was questionable, by depriving the applicants of protection, on the basis that their area did not accommodate a hundred people, the law was not giving due weight to the interests of the applicants.",

In common they submitted, inter alia, that unlike the ECHR cases dealing with environmental pollution, the present case did not deal with such pollution, because, among other reasons, the letting off of fireworks was restricted to a few hours over a few days in a whole year."

                "20. On 30 October 2009, the Constitutional Court reversed the first-instance judgment. It noted that the applicants ’ case was not grounded on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, although the applicants had made reference to damage to their property, but on Article 8. Thus, the Court had to establish whether the State had taken all the necessary measures to protect the applicants ’ rights under this provision. The Court acknowledged that the noise and peril to their lives and property during certain days created an inconvenience for the applicants which amounted to interference. However, the interference was in accordance with the law, as it had its basis in the Control of Fireworks and Other Explosives Regulations, and whether the CoP had issued licences according to the regulations, a matter which was to be examined by the ordinary courts as established by the first-instance court, was irrelevant. As to the proportionality of the interference the Court considered that in the present case the complaint was not directed towards a fireworks factory near the applicants ’ residence, but simply the venue used to let off the fireworks at a specific time. In the present case, the relevant law struck a balance between the conflicting interests by means of specific measures, such as the times at which fireworks could be let off; the type of fireworks which could be let off; the different venues which could be used; the security distances which had to be complied with; compulsory insurance coverage; the presence of a fire engine; and police on site. Indeed, in the present case the police were on site to make sure that the action was taken according to the permits issued and a person from the relevant association was present in the area of the applicants ’ houses as a precaution. The latter association also offered the applicants its help and protection to prevent any harm to the property. Thus, it could not be said that the applicants had not been protected. As to the definition of “inhabited area”, it was to be borne in mind that Malta was a small country, densely populated, with few, if any, areas where no people lived, and such legislation could only be seen in this context. Furthermore, the letting off of fireworks happened in a limited period for a few hours in a week twice a year and some years even less often. Acknowledging that such noise might also cause disturbance to other persons, old and young especially, the court could not ignore the fact that the applicants had been informed of this danger by the previous owner (who had had an accident in the house due to the fireworks) before they bought the house. Yet, they chose to purchase the said property. Overall the court was of the view that the legislator had successfully tried to reach a balance between the right to home and private life of the applicants and the traditional, cultural, religious and touristic needs of Maltese society, bearing in mind the size of the island. This might be otherwise if it were established that the measures applied were or would not be in accordance with the parameters set by law, a matter which the applicants had and have the right to contest before the ordinary courts regarding any future permit granted. In consequence there was no violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

Moreover, it has already been held that the applicants were receiving appropriate protection and that the applicants had knowingly decided to move to the area in question.",

A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area within reasonable limits. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete breaches such as unauthorised entry into a person ’ s home, but may also include those that are diffuse, such as noise, emissions, smells or other similar forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person ’ s right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home ( see Moreno Gómez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, § 53, ECHR 2004-X, and Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, § 21, 9 November 2010 ). Although there is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution an issue may arise under Article 8 of the Convention (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C; Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, § 40; Furlepa v. Poland ( dec .), no. 62101/00, 18 March 2008; and Oluić v. Croatia, no. 61260/08, § 45, 20 May 2010 ). Specifically, Article 8 of the Convention applies to severe environmental pollution which may affect individuals ’ well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, even without seriously endangering their health (see, among others, Taşkın and Others v.

Russia, no. 55723/00, §§ 66-70, ECHR 2005-IV, and Galev and Others v Bulgaria, ( dec .), no. 18324/04, 29 September 2009 )."

The Court has no doubt that the letting off of fireworks in the vicinity of the applicants ’ home, situated in the “countryside” or what by Maltese standards can be considered a rural area, can reach noise levels of 120db. While it is not disputed that such a level of noise was emitted only during a limited period of time, for two weeks over a whole year, and at intervals (see Relevant domestic law ), it can be accepted that the noise had at least a temporary effect on both the physical and to a certain extent the psychological state of those exposed to it. In consequence, such noise, in the Court ’ s view, falls under the notion of noise pollution (see, for example, Moreno Gómez, cited above, §§ 59- 62; and Ashworth and Others v. the United Kingdom, ( dec .), no. 39561/98, 20 January 2004) and can be considered to reach the minimum level of severity required for it to affect the applicants ’ rights to respect for their private lives and their homes (see, for example, Oluić, cited above, § 62, in respect of noise from a bar; and Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, § 97, 25 November 2010, in respect of a computer club ’ s business; and conversely, Galev and Others, ( dec .), cited above, in relation to noise emanating from a dentist ’ s surgery; Fägerskiöld v. Sweden ( dec .), no. 37664/04, 26 February 2008, concerning noise from a wind turbine; and Leon and Agnieszka Kania v. Poland, no. 12605/03, §§ 101-03, 21 July 2009, concerning noise from a lorry maintenance and metal-cutting and grinding workshop ). It also notes that as a consequence of the fireworks display the applicants ’ property has suffered a certain amount of damage, a matter which has not been contested. Furthermore, the applicants ’ family may be exposed to some physical and personal risk. Taking into account these factors as a whole, the Court considers that the effects of such displays on the applicants ’ private and family life and on the enjoyment of their homes was such that the alleged nuisance attained the level of severity required for Article 8 to be engaged."

Moreover, they alleged that smoke inhalation also affected their health. The activity had further caused other damage to their property (as had been the case with the pool and roof membrane) as a result of debris and other residues (such as burning string, cardboard and unexploded fireworks). Furthermore, such fireworks posed an unacceptable risk even to their lives, for example, they alleged that if a container full of fireworks were to explode, their house and the rest of the cluster of houses would be wiped out – as often happened with firework factory explosions. They highlighted that for two days before the feast fireworks were stored in a container close to the applicants ’ property.

They explained that according to the law the Group of Experts and the Explosives Committee could only give advice to the CoP, who ultimately had discretion to decide whether to issue such permits. Similarly, the Ombudsman ’ s recommendations were not binding. However, any allegation in respect of the lawfulness of such an action had not fulfilled the exhaustion requirement, as the applicants had failed to use ordinary domestic remedies, namely a challenge to the administrative acts. Indeed, the applicants had never pursued ordinary civil proceedings contesting any of the CoP decisions. Moreover, the Government disputed the Ombudsman ’ s findings of 22 February 2001, which were based on the premise that the 200 m distance also applied to areas which did not qualify as “inhabited areas”. In fact there were no legal minimum distances applicable for areas which were “ not inhabited”, but safety precautions were in place according to the regulations and the conditions imposed on permits."

Such measures regulated interference by third parties with a person ’ s private rights, and required a balance to be reached between the religious and social expression of village communities and the interests of the applicants."

The Government also submitted that any interference was proportionate and justified under paragraph two of the provision and that the domestic courts were in the best position to analyse the situation. They noted that firework displays had a long tradition in the country and many people devoted voluntary work, time and money to that cause which they considered their hobby. Village feasts and firework displays were a part of Maltese character and culture, and were one of the major tourist attractions during the summer period. Moreover, the feasts created substantial economic activity, with a huge positive impact on the economy of the country."

For this reason it regulated both the manufacturing of fireworks and the way they were displayed, in such a way as to maintain the tradition and the economic activity whilst protecting and ensuring safety for all concerned. Fireworks legislation had evolved to reflect the urban development of the Maltese islands. These regulations bore in mind the residents in the vicinity of the sites and the size of the country, together with its population density. They noted that had the legislation applied the same distance from any house, the firework tradition, dearly appreciated by many, would cease to exist. Specifically, in the present case, there was no other alternative, such as moving the site further north, since this “new” area would have been far too close to other residences and would virtually abut a road. In the Government ’ s view the regulations had reached an appropriate balance, as had been held by the Constitutional Court which based its judgment on relevant and sufficient reasons, bearing in mind the size of the country, the duration of the interference, and the element of self-imposed hardship."

Acknowledging that noise can be considered a pollutant, the Government submitted that the evidence put forward by the applicants did not show the normal level of noise in their household and whether in their lives they had been subject to high levels of noise, such as clubbing music or use of headphones, other factors which could also have caused an impairment. Indeed, in respect of the first applicant they noted that he was a sixty-one - year - old amateur drummer, and no proof had been submitted that any hearing disability was not already present before he moved to that address. As evidenced by the applicants ’ documentation before the domestic courts, their hearing returned to normal just after the letting off of fireworks and therefore the fireworks could only have had a minor temporal effect - and the applicants had been aware of any such possible danger, which had allowed for price negotiation on purchase. The Government noted that the fact that fireworks were discharged in the open abated the effects of noise pollution. Moreover, fireworks were discharged at intervals, over short periods of time, the longest period being a continuous thirty minutes for the main aerial display. The Government also considered that the applicants could stay away from home during that limited period of time if they feared for their hearing to such an extent."

Making reference to the Court ’ s case-law, the Government reiterated that there had not been any serious environmental pollution, the letting off of fireworks was not a permanent source of pollution, nor did it create any irreversible damage - just marks and spots on the swimming pool deck and the roof membrane of the applicants ’ house. They argued that the probability that the applicants ’ property was affected by debris and so on was heavily dependent on the wind direction, which was subject to constant change. Moreover, the applicants never instituted claims against the third parties responsible in respect of the minimal damage they had suffered, nor did they accept any precautionary assistance, such as protecting the swimming pool, its deck and the house roof with protective fire retardant material, which would absorb the effect of any falling material. The Government contended that the allegation that unexploded material or burning fireworks fell on to the property had not been supported by irrefutable evidence. While it had not been established where the applicants collected the unexploded fireworks, the Government noted that thirty pieces of unexploded material over twelve years showed how limited the impact was."

The Government noted that, as prescribed by law, the exercise was strictly monitored to prevent accidents, and safety measures (including a fire engine) were in place to respond where necessary, together with the relevant insurance policy. Police inspectors ensured that the fireworks were being let off according to the regulations in force, and accompanied transportation of the fireworks from the factory to the site. Moreover, the Government noted that one of the permit conditions was that persons discharging fireworks had the duty to search the surrounding area for unexploded material after the fireworks were let off. Thus, the associations responsible for discharging fireworks engaged individuals to attend to the site and ensure safety precautions were implemented and adhered to. Indeed, these associations had offered to cover the applicants ’ outdoor areas, but the applicants, unlike their neighbours, had refused the offer. Since this action required the authorisation of the applicants, the Government could not be blamed for the applicants ’ refusal to allow such an action."

The Government considered that the applicants ’ allegations were exaggerated and that the rate of accidents during the discharge of fireworks was, though regrettable, comparable to accidents at places of work or traffic accidents. Moreover, accidents during displays were invariably suffered by the people discharging the fireworks, apart from exceptional circumstances when inexperienced third parties came across unexploded material and attempted to discharge it. The Government insisted that accidents related to firework manufacturing could not be of any relevance to the present case. As to the storage of fireworks in containers, the Government submitted that, as a security measure, fireworks were brought on site on the day of the display. They were handled carefully, spread around the area and not left in clusters, to reduce the danger of accidental ignition. The operation was constantly monitored by fire-fighters. It followed that the applicants ’ allegation that an explosion would wipe out their house was unfounded and unsubstantiated."

The Government highlighted that the applicants knew about the current practice and the damage which the previous owner had suffered as a result of the discharge of fireworks, and yet they chose to purchase the relevant property, which at the time was a farmhouse and which the applicants converted into a luxurious property. Thus, any damage suffered by the applicants was self- imposed as they knowingly chose to purchase the property, and remained living there for a number of years, notwithstanding that they were financially able to move elsewhere. Referring to the Court ’ s recent case-law ( see Galev and Others v Bulgaria, ( dec .), cited above; Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, 9 November 2010; and Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, 25 November 2010 ) the Government noted that in these cases the interference resulted from actions which disturbed previously peaceful situations, and not, as in the applicants ’ case, a self- inflicted hindrance, due to their choice to set up home in that specific location."

Indeed, the applicants were present at a number of meetings, both at the police station and on site. Although taking into account the advice given, the CoP also had to establish a proper balance between the interests involved, while acting within the limits of the law. Thus, while such recommendations were followed when possible, this had not always been the case. The Government concluded that the applicants ’ argument was unfounded, since their complaints and submissions had led to an examination of their case by the CoP, the Group of Experts, the Explosives Committee and also by the Ombudsman, before reaching the domestic courts."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it may involve the authorities ’ adopting measures designed to secure respect for private life and home, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 55). Thus, Article 8 may apply in environmental cases, whether the pollution is directly caused by the State or whether State responsibility arises from the failure to regulate private-sector activities properly. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants ’ rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention.

In order to justify the letting off of fireworks at the relevant distances from the specific location, in the vicinity of the applicants, the Government referred not only to the cultural and religious interests of the Maltese community but also to the economic interests of the country as a whole. In their submission these considerations serve to justify impinging on the Article 8 rights of the persons affected by this tradition. The Court considers it reasonable to assume that firework displays are one of the highlights of a village feast which attracts village locals, other nationals and tourists, an occasion which undeniably generates an amount of income and which therefore, at least to a certain extent, aids the general economy. Moreover, it has no doubt that traditional village feasts can be considered as part of Maltese cultural and religious heritage. The Court observes that according to the second paragraph of Article 8 restrictions are permitted, inter alia, in the interests of the economic well-being of the country and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. It is therefore legitimate for the State to have taken the above interests into consideration in the shaping of the regulatory framework applicable to the fireworks culture."

Whilst the State is required to give due consideration to the particular interests, the respect for which it is obliged to secure by virtue of Article 8, it must in principle be left a choice between the different ways and means of meeting this obligation.

Moreover, it has already damaged the applicants ’ property, although the Court finds it pertinent to note that the damage which the property has suffered is minimal, and reversible. Furthermore, the applicants can take action against those responsible for such damage through ordinary civil proceedings. As to any other risks pertaining to the letting off of fireworks, while the Court notes that the mortality rate relating to the fireworks industry in Malta is alarming, as noted by the Government, such accidents occur less frequently during the actual displays and are often related to fireworks manufacturing. Indeed, in the applicants ’ case no risk to life or personal integrity has to date materialised ( see, conversely, Georgel and Georgeta Stoicescu v. Romania, no. 9718/03, 26 July 2011 ). Moreover, the applicants have not adduced evidence as to any real risk of an explosion destroying their property or substantially damaging it. Thus, although the Court is not in a position to entirely exclude any risk of personal injury, in particular having regard to the unexploded material which has allegedly been found on the applicants ’ property, it finds that it has not been established that the applicants are subject to a real and immediate risk to their life or their physical integrity. Neither does the Court find it sufficiently established that fireworks give rise to any health concern, other than that mentioned above. This having been said, the Court is ready to accept that the repeated letting off of fireworks at sound levels reaching at least 120db, for two weeks each year, even though intermittently, creates considerable inconvenience for the applicants, which must be balanced against the interests of the community."

The Court accepts that in this context the authorities were entitled, having regard to the general nature of the measures taken, to identify distances from where third parties could perform the relevant displays, taking into account the geographical situation in Malta and its population density. The Court further accepts that it was justifiable to allow for the designation, as letting off sites, of areas in the rural zones, which were further away from densely inhabited areas, even though this might result in there being a shorter distance from other existing properties. As to the measurements applied, the Court notes that the security distance applicable to inhabited areas was that of 150 or 200 metres, according to the type of fireworks concerned. In the applicants ’ case, while no minimum distance was applicable, as they lived in an “ uninhabited ” area, in practice the actual distance between their home and the letting off zone was, as recognised by the parties, 150 metres. The Court, acknowledging that this might offer a lower degree of protection, notes that such a distance in principle still affords a certain degree of protection. Moreover, the application of this distance in practice and the lack of regulation in respect of distances applicable to uninhabited areas did not mean that the concerns of the people affected were totally disregarded."

Quite apart from the relevant procedure and requirements for the issuance of permits to allow such displays (see section 14 of the regulations), as submitted by the Government, regulations were in place in respect of transportation and unloading of fireworks. Such actions and the actual letting off of the fireworks were accordingly monitored by police inspectors and fire-fighters. Insurance covering the activity was also mandatory. Moreover, obligations were imposed on the third parties operating such displays (see section 17 of the regulations) and it has not been contended that the third parties failed to fulfil these obligations, in so far as it depended on them.

However, this does not mean that decisions can only be taken if comprehensive and measurable data are available in relation to each and every aspect of the matter to be decided. In this respect, the Court notes that the Government have not adduced evidence in respect of any impact assessment studies made in this respect; indeed relevant studies have only been put forward by the applicants, who, however, have not focused on this aspect of the case.

Had any representations not been taken into account, or had the CoP, as happened in the present case, not taken such advice, the applicants were able to challenge the decisions in the ordinary courts, a course of action which they chose not to take. The Court notes, however, that while the CoP ’ s decisions were not contested through ordinary proceedings, the applicants undertook constitutional redress proceedings. In consequence, it cannot be said that they did not have an opportunity to make their views heard.

Thus, following the applicant ’ s complaints, the Administrative Court on 17 December 2009 quashed the decisions of the administrative authorities authorising that activity and remitted the case for re-examination (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above). However, the order made by the Administrative Court remained futile, as it was not effectively complied with, and in fact, according to the material available before the Court, the relevant proceedings are still pending after almost four years. At the same time it remains unclear under what operating licence the bar is still operating, particularly having in mind the findings of the Administrative Inspectorate of 24 November 2010, which noted that the operating licence issued in 2005 was no longer valid ( see paragraph 44 above, and compare Mileva and Others, cited above, § 99 )."

The applicant also used the relevant and available remedies in the civil courts and brought her application before the Court within the six-month time-limit after she had exhausted these remedies.

The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA), whereas if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

The latter remedy was more focused on the problem of noise nuisance and was thus more appropriate for the applicant ’ s complaints. Furthermore, the applicant had failed to lodge a request with the local administration for a reduction in the working hours of the bar and the shop, which would have eliminated noise nuisance during the night. In any event, the Government considered that the applicant ’ s complaints were premature, since a number of proceedings before the competent domestic authorities, namely the sanitary inspector, the County Office, various inspectorates, and the Administrative Court, were still pending.

Therefore, she should have brought her complaints to the Court within six months of realising that this was the case.

She therefore considered that, given that she had been pursuing various remedies before the competent administrative authorities for more than ten years without ever having her complaints effectively and properly examined, and thus never achieving a final settlement of her case, her application to the Court could not be considered premature for not waiting for a final decision by the administrative authorities. She also considered that she had diligently pursued the domestic remedies in the civil courts, considering that the courts could give her protection, but this had resulted only in manifestly unfair proceedings and decisions.

The measurements of 21 January 2008 (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above) had showed that the noise had only slightly exceeded the permitted levels. It was true that this report had showed that the permitted level of noise had been significantly exceeded (by 13 and 15 dB) in the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor and inside the flat on the ground floor, but that had happened only when chairs were being dragged, which had been only a temporary occurrence that could not affect any of the applicant ’ s rights.

The expert report of 14 November 2008 concerning the noise insulation in the house (see paragraphs 48-49 and 52 above) had first found the noise insulation insufficient but then, after the company had carried out the necessary work on the insulation, the report had found the noise insulation adequate. In addition, the expert report commissioned during the civil proceedings confirmed that the noise in the applicant ’ s flat did not exceed permitted levels, and in that regard the applicant had all the procedural guarantees of a fair trial to challenge the findings. The Government also pointed out that the expert reports had not found the level of any other emissions affecting the applicant ’ s flat excessive.

                "140. The Court finds the present case similar to the case of Oluić (cited above) in which it examined complaints of excessive levels of noise from a bar located in the building in which the applicant lived, and to the case of Moreno Gómez v. Spain ( no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004 ‑ X) concerning complaints of excessive levels of noise emanating from nightclubs. In the former case the Court was satisfied, on the basis of a number of unequivocal and compelling tests carried out over a period of eight years, that the level of noise there exceeded the maximum permitted levels under the domestic law and under the relevant international standards (see Oluić, cited above, §§ 52-63). The Court reached the same conclusion in the case of Moreno Gómez, in which it found it obvious that the applicant ’ s daily life was disrupted by the excessive night-time noise from nightclubs, which continued over a number of years and thus amounted to a breach of Article 8 (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, §§ 58-60). Similarly, in the case of Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria ( nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, 25 November 2010 ), comparable to the present case in that it concerned allegations of excessive noise from a computer club located in the same residential building as the applicants ’ and below their flat, the Court found, even without any noise tests being carried out at the domestic level, that the disturbance affecting the applicants ’ homes and their private and family lives reached the minimum level of severity under Article 8 of the Convention. It based its findings on the noise and various other disturbances created by those attending the computer club in and around the residential building (see Mileva and Others, cited above, § 97)."

In the present case the Court is unable to draw any clear conclusion from the expert reports commissioned during the domestic proceedings as to the exact level of noise coming from the bar. It observes, however, that several expert reports suggest that the noise in the applicant ’ s flat exceeded the permitted levels."

                "142. In this connection the Court notes that the first noise tests concerning the level of noise and noise insulation in the bar were carried out in August 2002 by company Z. (see paragraph 22 above). This report indicated that the level of noise and the noise insulation were in compliance with the relevant domestic law. However, the noise level was not measured in the applicant ’ s flat at the time, and these findings were later refuted by the noise measurements of 21 January 2008 (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above) and 15 March 2008 (see paragraph 69 above). As regards the reference in the report that the applicant had declined to allow noise measurements to be taken in her flat, the Court sees no reason not to accept the findings of the Ministry of Tourism of 17 September 2003 and the Administrative Court of 6 September 2007, which both found that the applicant had not been given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings (see paragraph 26 above). Therefore, the Court is unable to place sufficient confidence in the assertion made in this report."

                "143. The noise expert report of 5 October 2005 drawn up by company E. also found that the level of noise was not excessive. This report, however, did not measure the level of noise in the applicant ’ s flat, and it took the limit for external noise reception under the by-law applicable to dwellings in areas predominantly used for business purposes (see paragraphs 30 and 110 above and zone 4 under table no. 1 of the by-law ). Thus, the report found that the measured level of noise at 48 dB in the parking area and in the entrance to the applicant ’ s flat did not exceed the permitted level of 50 dB during the night (see paragraph 31 above). It is not, however, clear how the report came to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used for business purposes, given that the applicant used 59. 63 % of the house as living space, while the company used 40. 37 % for business purposes (see paragraph 7 above). This leads to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used as a residential property, and that the maximum noise level under the by- law should be 45 dB (see paragraph 110 above and zone 3 of table no. 1 of the by-law ) applicable to premises predominantly used as dwellings. This approach, considering the applicant ’ s house to fall within zone 3 under table no. 1 of the by-law, was later used in two reports on noise measurements (see paragraphs 69 and 82 above). Therefore, if the expert report drawn up by company E. had correctly placed the house under the relevant zone it would have found that the measured level of noise at 48 dB in fact exceeded the permitted level of 45 dB under the relevant domestic law and the international standards (see paragraph 114 above)."

The expert report of 2 October 2006, commissioned from the Institute during the civil proceedings, relied on company E. ’ s report, above, and found that the noise did not exceed the permitted levels (see paragraph 82 above). For the reasons set out above concerning company E. ’ s report the Court has serious doubts as to the findings of the Institute. Its relevance is placed even more in question by the fact that the civil courts, without providing the relevant reasons, never responded properly to the allegations made by the applicant and several witnesses that the Institute ’ s experts measured the level of noise while the sources of noise in the bar were switched off (see paragraphs 84 and 88-89 above). Furthermore, the noise expert stated at the hearing before the Križevci Municipal Court that he had not taken into account the documentation concerning the noise insulation, and that he considered the running of the air-conditioning fan in the bar irrelevant as regards the noise measurements (see paragraph 85 above) although it was a relevant factor for the measurements conducted by company B-I. (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above) and it was provided as a relevant factor under the domestic law (see paragraph 110 above and section 10 of the by-law )."

                "145. Further noise tests were carried out by company B-I. on 21 January and 7 March 2008 (see paragraphs 62-63 and 65 above). The first report found that when chairs were being dragged across the floor inside the bar during the day the level of noise in the applicant ’ s flat on the ground floor exceeded the permitted level by 11 dB and in the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor by 4 dB. During the night the level of noise in the entrance to the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor exceeded the permitted level by 2 dB while all sources of noise in the bar were switched on and while only the air-conditioning fan was running in the bar. Inside the living room the level of noise during the night was over the limit by 3 dB when the sources of noise were turned on and when the fan was running, and by 13 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar. The level of noise inside the flat on the ground floor was over the limit by 4 dB while the sources of noise were switched on and by 16 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar (see paragraph 63 above). Moreover, these measurements show that the level of noise exceeded the relevant international standards for noise levels (see paragraph 114 above, and compare Oluić, cited above, §§ 54-60). The report of 7 March 2008 drawn up by company B-I., which was focused on the improvements to the air-conditioning system in the bar, found that the level of noise was not excessive; that was also confirmed by company E. (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above). However, since there are no indications that at that point any improvements to the noise insulation in the flooring of the bar had been made, and in fact in November 2008 the noise insulation was found to be insufficient (see paragraph 48 above), it could be concluded that the noise created by dragging the chairs across the floor inside the bar remained excessive. Such noise, given the extent to which it exceeded the permitted levels and the fact that it was pervasive in the ordinary regular activities of the customers of the bar, must have disturbed the amenity of the applicant ’ s everyday life."

While the first measurements, taken on 24 November 2008, showed that the noise insulation was not adequate, the second measurements of 13 February 2009 showed that the noise insulation was sufficient. However, the latter findings were not based on any noise insulation standards, since such standards did not exist at the time (see paragraph 52 above).

In the following period, however, the Government did not act promptly and consistently and did not back up this decision with the necessary resources to have it enforced. While according to the Government's observations the 1994 decision automatically lost its legal power by 1997 in view of the factory downsizing, the applicants were never officially informed of this, much less given a reference to the legal provision on the basis of which the decision at issue could have automatically lost its effect, in particular, in the absence of a new factory buffer zone management plan. Moreover, it appears that in April 2000 the 1994 decision was backed up by that of the Ecological Safety Commission, resolving to solicit State funding for the resettlement of eighteen families from the factory buffer zone. While the names of the families apparently remained unlisted, their number – eighteen - was the same as that mentioned in the 1994 decision. The Court therefore finds that the applicants could have reasonably expected to be among them. It was not until 21 June 2004 for the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family and 26 December 2005 for the Dubetska-Nayda family that the applicants were formally declared to be living outside the prospective factory buffer zone and not entitled to relocation at State expense.

The judicial proceedings, which lasted some three and a half years at one level of jurisdiction for the Dubetska-Nayda family and a little over five years at three levels of jurisdiction for the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family, were marked by certain delays, in particular, on account of some significant intervals between hearings. Next, the decision given in the Dubetska-Nayda family's favour did not change the family's situation, as throughout the next five years and until now it has not been funded. Consequently, the Court remarks that for more than twelve years from the Convention's entry into force and up to now little or nothing has been done to help the applicants to move to a safer area."

The Court considers that when it comes to the wide margin of appreciation available to the States in context of their environmental obligations under Article 8 of the Convention, it would be going too far to establish an applicant's general right to free new housing at the State's expense ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 133 ).

A major measure contemplated by the Government in this regard during the period in question concerned the development of scientifically justified buffer zone management plans for the mine and the factory. This measure appears to have been mandatory under the applicable law, as at various times the public health authorities imposed sanctions on the facilities'management for failures to implement it, going as far as the suspension of their operating licences (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). However, these suspensions apparently remained unenforced and neither the mine nor the factory has put in place a valid functioning buffer zone management plan as yet."

When dismissing the applicants'claims against the factory for resettlement, the judicial authorities pointed out that the applicants'rights should be duly protected by this plan, in particular, in view of the anticipated downsizing of the spoil heap and its hydro-insulation. However, these measures, envisioned by the plan as necessary in order to render the factory's operation harmless to the area outside the buffer zone, have still not been enforced more than five years later (see paragraph 38 above). There also appear to have been, at least until the launch of the aqueduct no later than in 2009, delays in supplying potable water to the hamlet, which resulted in considerable difficulties for the applicants. The applicants cannot therefore be said to have been duly protected from the environmental risks emanating from the factory operation."

It appears, however, that the applicants in any event continue to be affected by its presence, in particular as they have not been compensated for damage caused by soil subsidence. In addition, the Dubetska-Nayda family lives within 100 metres of the mine's spoil heap, which needs environmental management regardless of whether it is still in use."

At the same time, the Court notes that these industrial facilities were located in a rural area and the applicants belonged to a very small group of people (apparently not more than two dozen families) who lived nearby and were most seriously affected by pollution.

Furthermore, both applicant families in the present case chose to exhaust domestic remedies with respect to their claim to be resettled from the area, permanently affected by pollution. One family obtained a resettlement order, which however remains unenforced as the debtor mine lacks budgetary allocations for it, and the other's claim was dismissed on the grounds that it lived outside the pollutants'statutory buffer zone.

In addition, the applicants'wells were not equipped with the necessary filters and pipes. Moreover, the applicants were supplied with imported water.

If such a zone had been approved the applicants'houses would have been located within its boundaries, setting in motion the legal provisions calling for their resettlement regardless of the actual level of pollution.

However, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise where an environmental hazard attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant's ability to enjoy his home, private or family life. The assessment of that minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual's health or quality of life (see, among other authorities, Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 68-69)."

                "149. Yet in 1994, before the Convention's entry into force, the Sokalskyy Executive Committee made the choice in favour of relocation. In the following period, however, the Government did not act promptly and consistently and did not back up this decision with the necessary resources to have it enforced. While according to the Government's observations the 1994 decision automatically lost its legal power by 1997 in view of the factory downsizing, the applicants were never officially informed of this, much less given a reference to the legal provision on the basis of which the decision at issue could have automatically lost its effect, in particular, in the absence of a new factory buffer zone management plan. Moreover, it appears that in April 2000 the 1994 decision was backed up by that of the Ecological Safety Commission, resolving to solicit State funding for the resettlement of eighteen families from the factory buffer zone. While the names of the families apparently remained unlisted, their number – eighteen - was the same as that mentioned in the 1994 decision. The Court therefore finds that the applicants could have reasonably expected to be among them. It was not until 21 June 2004 for the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family and 26 December 2005 for the Dubetska-Nayda family that the applicants were formally declared to be living outside the prospective factory buffer zone and not entitled to relocation at State expense. It was also only on 26 December 2005 that the State authorities acknowledged their obligation under domestic law to resettle the Dubetska-Nayda family from the mine spoil heap buffer zone. The judicial proceedings, which lasted some three and a half years at one level of jurisdiction for the Dubetska-Nayda family and a little over five years at three levels of jurisdiction for the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family, were marked by certain delays, in particular, on account of some significant intervals between hearings. Next, the decision given in the Dubetska-Nayda family's favour did not change the family's situation, as throughout the next five years and until now it has not been funded. Consequently, the Court remarks that for more than twelve years from the Convention's entry into force and up to now little or nothing has been done to help the applicants to move to a safer area."

The Court considers that when it comes to the wide margin of appreciation available to the States in context of their environmental obligations under Article 8 of the Convention, it would be going too far to establish an applicant's general right to free new housing at the State's expense ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 133 ).

A major measure contemplated by the Government in this regard during the period in question concerned the development of scientifically justified buffer zone management plans for the mine and the factory. This measure appears to have been mandatory under the applicable law, as at various times the public health authorities imposed sanctions on the facilities'management for failures to implement it, going as far as the suspension of their operating licences (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). However, these suspensions apparently remained unenforced and neither the mine nor the factory has put in place a valid functioning buffer zone management plan as yet."

When dismissing the applicants'claims against the factory for resettlement, the judicial authorities pointed out that the applicants'rights should be duly protected by this plan, in particular, in view of the anticipated downsizing of the spoil heap and its hydro-insulation. However, these measures, envisioned by the plan as necessary in order to render the factory's operation harmless to the area outside the buffer zone, have still not been enforced more than five years later (see paragraph 38 above). There also appear to have been, at least until the launch of the aqueduct no later than in 2009, delays in supplying potable water to the hamlet, which resulted in considerable difficulties for the applicants. The applicants cannot therefore be said to have been duly protected from the environmental risks emanating from the factory operation."

It appears, however, that the applicants in any event continue to be affected by its presence, in particular as they have not been compensated for damage caused by soil subsidence. In addition, the Dubetska-Nayda family lives within 100 metres of the mine's spoil heap, which needs environmental management regardless of whether it is still in use."

At the same time, the Court notes that these industrial facilities were located in a rural area and the applicants belonged to a very small group of people (apparently not more than two dozen families) who lived nearby and were most seriously affected by pollution.

                "65. In assessing this matter, the Court recognises the complexity of the State ’ s tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. Being mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, on many occasions the Court has emphasized that the States should enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation in the complex sphere of environmental policymaking ( see, for example, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 100, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). While the authorities of the Member States are increasingly taking on responsibility for minimising or controlling pollution, Article 8 cannot be construed as requiring them to ensure that every individual enjoys housing that meets particular environmental standards (see Ward v. the United Kingdom ( dec .), no. 31888/03, 9 November 2004). In line with these considerations, the Court considers that it would be going too far to render the Government responsible for the very fact of allowing cross-town through traffic to pass through a populated street or establish the applicant ’ s general right to free, new housing at the State ’ s expense. All the more so, given that the applicant in the present case has not argued that her house has decreased in value since October 1998 or that she has otherwise been unable to sell it and relocate without the State ’ s support (see, a contrario, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 121, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV )."
            ],
            [
                "67. It notes, firstly, that the Government have not shown that the 1998 decision to route motorway M04 via K. Street was preceded by an adequate feasibility study, assessing the probability of compliance with applicable environmental standards and enabling interested parties, including K. Street ’ s residents, to contribute their views ( see, a contrario, Hatton, cited above, § 128 ). On the contrary, the nature of this decision and the adequacy of attenuating procedures appear quite ambiguous, particularly in light of the Government ’ s disagreement with the applicant as to whether the 1998 decision re-routed the traffic from P. Street to K. Street or merely confirmed K. Street ’ s earlier status as a through road. The Court considers, however, that even if K. Street had been used by through traffic before the 1998 stocktaking project, the State authorities were responsible for ensuring minimal procedural safeguards in this project ’ s course. Neither the domestic court decisions, nor the Government ’ s observations contain evidence that these safeguards, and particularly public access to relevant environmental information and decision-taking in the period of contemplating the stocktaking project, existed."

            [
                "68. Secondly, the Court considers that no later than the time of the 1998 stocktaking project, the authorities likewise became responsible for putting in place a reasonable policy for mitigating the motorway ’ s harmful effects on the Article 8 rights of K. Street ’ s residents (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 127-131 ). It appears that the municipal authorities did take some measures aimed at the street ’ s environmental management ( see paragraph 30 above). However, neither the assessment made by domestic courts in their judgments, nor the Government ’ s observations contain sufficient detail enabling the Court to conclude that this management was effective and meaningful before the measurement of critical pollution levels on 15 May 2002. As transpires from the available materials, this measurement session was carried out only in response to repeated complaints by K. Street ’ s residents, which, according to the case file, were initially lodged no later than in 2000."

Thirdly, emphasising the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making as a procedural safeguard for ensuring rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention, the Court underlines that an essential element of this safeguard is an individual ’ s ability to challenge an official act or omission affecting her rights in this sphere before an independent authority (see Dubetska, cited above, § 143 ). It also notes that as of 30 October 2001 the Aarhus Convention, which concerns access to information, participation of the public in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters has entered into force in respect of Ukraine (see paragraph 39 above). In the meantime, it has not been shown in the present case that the applicant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest the State authorities ’ policymaking regarding the M04 motorway during the period of October 1998 – June 2002 before the domestic courts."

As appears from the brief reasoning adduced by the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal for dismissing her claim ( see paragraph 33 above), its analysis was mostly limited to concluding that the defendant was not at all responsible for K. Street ’ s maintenance and repair. The Court notes that a variety of documents in the case file appear to pinpoint that such responsibility did – at least to some extent – in fact exist ( see paragraphs 24 ‑ 26, 30 and 34 above ), while the court ’ s reasoning does not contain any reference to the evidence which served as a basis for its contrary conclusion."

            [
                "71. Regardless, however, of which authority was responsible for the maintenance of K. Street ’ s road surface and other amenities, the Court finds it more important that the courts ’ reasoning does not contain a direct response to the applicant ’ s main arguments, on the basis of which she had sought to establish the Executive Committee ’ s liability. In particular, while the first-instance court questioned some witnesses as to some points of the municipality ’ s environmental policy, neither its, nor the higher courts ’ judgments contain any express assessment as to why they considered that this policy adequately protected the applicant ’ s rights. Likewise, no reasoning was provided for dismissing an allegation that the defendant ’ s decision taken in October 1998 was in and of itself unlawful and arbitrary, and it is unclear from the case file whether this aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint was at all studied during the proceedings at issue. The Court considers that the applicant ’ s arguments concerning the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of the above decision and the adequacy of the municipality ’ s environmental policy concerning K. Street were of paramount importance for resolving whether or not the defendant ’ s conduct struck a fair balance between the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 8 and the interests of the community. Lacking reasoning for the dismissal of these arguments in the texts of the domestic judgments, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to adduce her viewpoints before an independent authority."

Second, the Government did not show that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the related decision-making processes, including by challenging the municipal policies before an independent authority. Bearing those two factors and the Aarhus Convention (see paragraph 39) in mind, the Court cannot conclude that a fair balance was struck in the present case."

The Housing Maintenance Department official acknowledged that his department was partly responsible for K.

Firstly, K. Street had served as a through road since 1983. In 1998 the street ’ s status as part of the motorway had merely been confirmed during the stocktaking project. The Government should therefore not be held responsible for the decision to route the traffic via K. Street. Secondly, following the entry of the Convention into force, the authorities had been contemplating the construction of a new through road, bypassing residential streets. However, they had had no choice but to use the existing road until the necessary funding could be found, as closing it off would have caused considerable detriment to the economic well-being of the country. Contrary to the applicant ’ s argument, the use of the road had not been at odds with applicable law, because paragraph 1.9 of the State Construction Guidelines had recommended, but had not required, that major motorways be constructed outside populated communities."

            [
                "57. The Government next argued that the pollution complained of had not been emitted by the State authorities ’ operation of the road, but rather by vehicles belonging to various owners. This pollution therefore could not qualify as State interference with the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights. Assuming the State had had a positive obligation to react to this pollution, it had done so by setting up a legislative scheme establishing safe pollution levels and a system to monitor compliance with that scheme. Once the State authorities had become aware that the road was not operating as intended, they had reacted quickly by closing it off to through traffic on 16 June 2002, more than a year before the applicant had applied to the Court."

                "58. Referring to its well-established case-law (see, among other authorities, López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303 ‑ C; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § § 105-108, 10 February 2011 ) the Court reiterates that, where, as in the present case, the case concerns an environmental hazard, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise only where the hazard at issue attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant ’ s ability to enjoy her home, private or family life. The assessment of that minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual ’ s health or quality of life."
            ],
            [
                "59. In line with these principles, the Court must first consider whether the detriment suffered by the applicant on account of the operation of the M04 motorway starting from October 1998 was sufficiently serious to raise an issue under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaints concern, primarily, the level of noise, damage to her house from vibration and her sufferings on account of the deterioration of her parents ’ and her minor son ’ s health resulting from air and soil pollution."
            ],
            [
                "60. The Court considers that there is insufficient evidence to prove all the applicant ’ s allegations ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’. In particular, the noise levels and their impact on the applicant ’ s private and family life have never been measured (see a contrario Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, § 23, 9 November 2010 ). The allegation that the damage to the house had been caused by vibration was disputed by the Government with reference to a competent authority ’ s opinion and has never been confirmed by an independent expert. Insofar as the applicant ’ s parents ’ health can fall within the scope of her family life under Article 8, the case file contains medical evidence that they suffer from numerous illnesses. However, based on this evidence, it is not possible to determine to what extent these illnesses have been caused or aggravated by the operation of the motorway. As regards the health of the applicant ’ s minor son, it appears that he already suffered from immunodeficiency before October 1998 and that in his doctors ’ opinion he had resided in an ‘ environmentally saturated area ’ from his birth in 1994 (see paragraph 17 above)."
            ],
            [
                "61. At the same time, the Court notes that according to the official investigation of 15 May 2002 ( see paragraph 12 above ), the surface of the road near the applicant ’ s house was severely damaged and more than one hundred vehicles drove over it during one hour. It is not implausible in these circumstances that the applicant was regularly disturbed by noise and vibration, at least to some extent. Further, more than half of the examined vehicles were found to be emitting pollutants in excess of applicable safety standards. The level of air and soil pollution was assessed by the domestic environmental health authorities as necessitating the suspension of the use of the road, on pain of risk of adverse impact on the residents ’ health ( see paragraph 19 above). The polluting substances emitted by the vehicles included copper and lead, an excessive level of which was also found in the soil near the applicant ’ s house. In light of these findings, the Court considers it particularly notable that the applicant ’ s son was diagnosed in 2002 with chronic lead and copper salts poisoning. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any evidence disproving the authenticity and accuracy of this diagnosis and have not proposed any plausible alternative explanation concerning the origin of this poisoning to counter the applicant ’ s allegation that it was directly connected to the motorway ’ s operation."
            ],
            [
                "62. Regard being had to the above data, the Court considers that the cumulative effect of noise, vibration and air and soil pollution generated by the M04 motorway significantly deterred the applicant from enjoying her rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 is therefore applicable in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "63. In view of the above, the Court will next examine, in the light of the principles developed in its jurisprudence (see, among other authorities, Dubetska, cited above, §§ 140- 145) whether the Government have provided sufficient evidence to justify a situation in which the applicant bore a heavy burden on behalf of the rest of the community."
            ],
            [
                "64. The Court firstly notes that, as submitted by the Government, on 16 June 2002, within one month of the investigation by the environmental health authorities, K. Street was closed off to through traffic. Lacking concrete data, and, in particular, texts of relevant domestic decisions (if any) in evidence of the applicant ’ s allegations that this decision was in fact enforced at an unspecified later date or that the traffic was eventually restarted, the Court will proceed from the assumption that through traffic was stopped on the date suggested by the Government (see, mutatis mutandis, Vinokurov v. Russia and Ukraine ( dec .), no. 2937/04, 16 October 2007). Consequently, it must be noted that the issues of noise, vibration, air and soil pollution connected to its functioning were redressed. It, however, remains to be examined whether the State authorities should still be liable for the adverse effects of the motorway ’ s operation between October 1998 and June 2002."
            ],
            [
                "65. In assessing this matter, the Court recognises the complexity of the State ’ s tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. Being mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, on many occasions the Court has emphasized that the States should enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation in the complex sphere of environmental policymaking ( see, for example, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 100, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). While the authorities of the Member States are increasingly taking on responsibility for minimising or controlling pollution, Article 8 cannot be construed as requiring them to ensure that every individual enjoys housing that meets particular environmental standards (see Ward v. the United Kingdom ( dec .), no. 31888/03, 9 November 2004). In line with these considerations, the Court considers that it would be going too far to render the Government responsible for the very fact of allowing cross-town through traffic to pass through a populated street or establish the applicant ’ s general right to free, new housing at the State ’ s expense. All the more so, given that the applicant in the present case has not argued that her house has decreased in value since October 1998 or that she has otherwise been unable to sell it and relocate without the State ’ s support (see, a contrario, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 121, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV )."
            ],
            [
                "66. While the Court finds no reason to reassess the substance of the Government ’ s decision to allow the use of K. Street as a through road, in examining the procedural aspect of relevant policymaking, the Court is not convinced that minimal safeguards to ensure a fair balance between the applicant ’ s and the community ’ s interests were put in place."
            ],
            [
                "67. It notes, firstly, that the Government have not shown that the 1998 decision to route motorway M04 via K. Street was preceded by an adequate feasibility study, assessing the probability of compliance with applicable environmental standards and enabling interested parties, including K. Street ’ s residents, to contribute their views ( see, a contrario, Hatton, cited above, § 128 ). On the contrary, the nature of this decision and the adequacy of attenuating procedures appear quite ambiguous, particularly in light of the Government ’ s disagreement with the applicant as to whether the 1998 decision re-routed the traffic from P. Street to K. Street or merely confirmed K. Street ’ s earlier status as a through road. The Court considers, however, that even if K. Street had been used by through traffic before the 1998 stocktaking project, the State authorities were responsible for ensuring minimal procedural safeguards in this project ’ s course. Neither the domestic court decisions, nor the Government ’ s observations contain evidence that these safeguards, and particularly public access to relevant environmental information and decision-taking in the period of contemplating the stocktaking project, existed."
            ],
            [
                "68. Secondly, the Court considers that no later than the time of the 1998 stocktaking project, the authorities likewise became responsible for putting in place a reasonable policy for mitigating the motorway ’ s harmful effects on the Article 8 rights of K. Street ’ s residents (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 127-131 ). It appears that the municipal authorities did take some measures aimed at the street ’ s environmental management ( see paragraph 30 above). However, neither the assessment made by domestic courts in their judgments, nor the Government ’ s observations contain sufficient detail enabling the Court to conclude that this management was effective and meaningful before the measurement of critical pollution levels on 15 May 2002. As transpires from the available materials, this measurement session was carried out only in response to repeated complaints by K. Street ’ s residents, which, according to the case file, were initially lodged no later than in 2000."
            ],
            [
                "69. Thirdly, emphasising the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making as a procedural safeguard for ensuring rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention, the Court underlines that an essential element of this safeguard is an individual ’ s ability to challenge an official act or omission affecting her rights in this sphere before an independent authority (see Dubetska, cited above, § 143 ). It also notes that as of 30 October 2001 the Aarhus Convention, which concerns access to information, participation of the public in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters has entered into force in respect of Ukraine (see paragraph 39 above). In the meantime, it has not been shown in the present case that the applicant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest the State authorities ’ policymaking regarding the M04 motorway during the period of October 1998 – June 2002 before the domestic courts."
            ],
            [
                "70. The Court notes that the applicant formally attempted to do so by lodging through Mrs Grishchenko a civil claim against the Executive Committee. As appears from the brief reasoning adduced by the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal for dismissing her claim ( see paragraph 33 above), its analysis was mostly limited to concluding that the defendant was not at all responsible for K. Street ’ s maintenance and repair. The Court notes that a variety of documents in the case file appear to pinpoint that such responsibility did – at least to some extent – in fact exist ( see paragraphs 24 ‑ 26, 30 and 34 above ), while the court ’ s reasoning does not contain any reference to the evidence which served as a basis for its contrary conclusion."
            ],
            [
                "71. Regardless, however, of which authority was responsible for the maintenance of K. Street ’ s road surface and other amenities, the Court finds it more important that the courts ’ reasoning does not contain a direct response to the applicant ’ s main arguments, on the basis of which she had sought to establish the Executive Committee ’ s liability. In particular, while the first-instance court questioned some witnesses as to some points of the municipality ’ s environmental policy, neither its, nor the higher courts ’ judgments contain any express assessment as to why they considered that this policy adequately protected the applicant ’ s rights. Likewise, no reasoning was provided for dismissing an allegation that the defendant ’ s decision taken in October 1998 was in and of itself unlawful and arbitrary, and it is unclear from the case file whether this aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint was at all studied during the proceedings at issue. The Court considers that the applicant ’ s arguments concerning the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of the above decision and the adequacy of the municipality ’ s environmental policy concerning K. Street were of paramount importance for resolving whether or not the defendant ’ s conduct struck a fair balance between the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 8 and the interests of the community. Lacking reasoning for the dismissal of these arguments in the texts of the domestic judgments, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to adduce her viewpoints before an independent authority."
            ],
            [
                "72. Overall, the Court attaches importance to the following factors. First, the Government ’ s failure to show that the decision to designate K. Street as part of the M04 motorway was preceded by an adequate environmental feasibility study and followed by the enactment of a reasonable environmental management policy. Second, the Government did not show that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the related decision-making processes, including by challenging the municipal policies before an independent authority. Bearing those two factors and the Aarhus Convention (see paragraph 39) in mind, the Court cannot conclude that a fair balance was struck in the present case."

It claimed that the first-instance court had misinterpreted the provisions of the Law on Administrative Proceedings, and thus limited the applicant company ’ s right of access to a court. The applicant company thought that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been implementing the function of public administration, and that that document had had a direct influence on the applicant company ’ s rights and obligations, and was thus an individual legal act that had to be examined before the administrative courts. On 28 November 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court of 23 July 2012. It held that the applicant company had questioned the lawfulness of both the Management Plan and the development plan. The Supreme Administrative Court held that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been carrying out the function of State power. Moreover, the court had already ruled on the issue of the attribution of the Management Plan to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and had decided that it had not been attributable to those courts (see paragraph 79 below). The court indicated that a legal act could consist of textual and graphic information (tables, drawings, schemes, plans, symbols, emblems). The Constitutional Court had already held that all parts of a legal act were interrelated and were of equal legal effect (see paragraph 77 below). The court further held that the present case was in substance identical to cases already examined by it, and that there were no grounds to reach a different conclusion on the nature of the Management Plan. The court explained that the applicant company could only raise the issue of the lawfulness of the Government Resolution in the context of an individual case regarding violation of its specific rights (by complaining against an individual legal act, by which the Government Resolution and the decisions of the Management Plan would be implemented). It could then ask the court examining that case to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The applicant company ’ s request to organise the procedure to amend the Management Plan so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of the Management Plan."

The court acknowledged that the authority ’ s decision had lacked a seal of approval but held that that shortcoming could not be regarded as grounds to overrule the decision. The court also held that the authority had not acted unlawfully, so there were no grounds for awarding the applicant company pecuniary damages. Moreover, domestic law did not require that the Management Plan contain a compensation mechanism for the buildings to be “ removed ”. However, the Management Plan in question indicated that an area in Juodkrantė had been designated to compensate for the losses incurred by the lawful owners of the buildings to be removed. Thus the Management Plan provided for the opportunity to compensate for possible losses. As regards the referral to the Constitutional Court, the court held that the applicant company had mistakenly stated that the decision to remove the buildings had only been indicated in the Management Plan. The court stated that it was a commonly known fact that the applicant company ’ s buildings had been earmarked for removal at the time the purchase agreement had been concluded, and the applicant company, as a diligent legal entity, should have assessed the legal status of the buildings and the restrictions on their use. The legitimate expectations of the applicant company had not been breached as it had not proved the need to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The court also pointed out that the buildings had not been taken from the applicant company for the needs of society (see paragraph 45 below). However, when using them the applicant company had to follow the legal regulations, which established that construction in the area in question was not allowed and that it was attempting to protect its rights in the wrong way.

                "“By a letter of 21 June 1999 the President and the Secretary General of the Lithuanian National Commission for UNESCO proposed to include the Curonian Spit on the World Heritage List (up to then, it had been included on the Tentative World Heritage List). On 29 November 2000 the Curonian Spit was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, subject to the following criterion: “The Curonian Spit is an outstanding example of a landscape of sand dunes that is under constant threat from natural forces (wind and tide). After disastrous human interventions that menaced its survival the Spit was reclaimed by massive protection and stabilization works begun in the 19th century and still continuing to the present day.”",
                "...[ T ] he State of Lithuania has always treated and treats the Curonian Spit as a unique landscape created by nature and man – an area which should be protected and in respect of which specific legal protection has to be put in place; this is a universally known fact.",
                "... The formation of the landscape in the Curonian Spit is still taking place; the social role of modern society, which is related to the traditional lifestyle and in which the evolutionary process is still in progress, is still active. The Curonian Spit reflects the material changes which have been taking place over the course of many decades and which are closely related to the interaction of natural forces and human beings. In the Curonian Spit, one can still see the remains of landscape where evolutionary processes have ended. There is the ethnographic heritage of the Curonian tribe, which lived in the Curonian Spit for a long time (and which is now extinct). In the relevant documents, the following examples of cultural heritage in the Curonian Spit have been noted: fishermen ’ s settlements where the interaction of man and nature is, from an ethno-cultural, historical and aesthetic point of view, of exceptional universal value; a wealth of unique works of architecture which, from an artistic and scientific point of view, were of exceptional value; and archaeological sites which are especially significant, owing to villages being swallowed up by moving sand. The particular importance of the Curonian Spit is also reflected by natural and cultural heritage, which is woven together in a picturesque manner and which is related not only to material or spiritual aspects, but also to the experience gained by every generation of the local people. This helps to rebuild the lost natural ecosystems of the Curonian Spit.",
                "... The legal instruments of the Republic of Lithuania ... enshrine the fundamental provision that the Curonian Spit National Park will be managed in accordance with the development plan... for the Curonian Spit National Park, approved by the Government.",
                "Thus, no decisions relating to the management of the territory of the Curonian Spit National Park... can be adopted without taking account of the scheme approved by the Government, and decisions cannot be in conflict with the provisions of the scheme...",
                "Otherwise, not only would the identity and integrity of the Curonian Spit as a unique landscape created by nature and man be violated, whereas it should be protected, but one would also violate... inter alia, paragraph 1 of Article 54 of the Constitution providing that the State must take care of the protection of the natural environment, wildlife and plants, individual natural objects and areas of particular value, and must supervise the sustainable use of natural resources, their restoration and development; and paragraph 3 of Article 53 providing that the State and each person must protect the environment from harmful influences. The international obligations of the Republic of Lithuania would also clearly be violated.",
                "The technical possibilities of preparing digital versions of the drawings provided in the development plan of 19 December 1994 only appeared in 1996-98 ...",
                "All those who wanted to familiarise themselves with the development plan could do so, in fact many people had applied to the Protected Areas Service and copies of the development plan had been prepared free of charge ...",
                "Moreover, when issuing the conditions of the detailed plan, references had always been made to the development plan, and there was no information that there had been any legal disputes regarding the accessibility of the plan.",
                "If a certain part of a legal act is not published in an official journal, it has to be clear from the part that had been published that other parts have not been published; it also has to be clear when people can familiarise themselves with the unpublished part; the accessibility of the unpublished part has to be ensured.",
                "The fact that the development plan has not been published as a whole in the official journal does not give grounds to assert that it has not been published at all or that it has been published unofficially, and that access to it has not been ensured ( Vien tai, kad Vyriausybės 1994 m. gruodžio 19 d. nutarimu Nr. 1269 „ Dėl Kuršių nerijos nacionalinio parko planavimo schemos ( generalinio plano )“ patvirtinta Kuršių nerijos nacionalinio parko planavimo schema ( generalinis planas ) nebuvo visa paskelbta „ Valstybės žiniose “, savaime neduoda pagrindo teigti, kad Schema buvo „ nepaskelbta “ arba „ paskelbta “ neviešai, neoficialiai, kad jos prieinamumas teisės subjektams nebuvo užtikrintas ).”"

In the context of the case at issue, the Constitutional Court held that certain areas were referred to as protected areas in domestic law, including national parks and reserves.

The implementation of the said right was preconditioned by the person ’ s perception that his or her rights had been breached (ruling of 1 October 1997). Denial of possibilities to challenge a certain decision before a court was incompatible with the concept of the rule of law and the constitutional doctrine of protection of one ’ s rights (rulings of 4 March 1999, 2 July 2002, 4 March 2003, 17 August 2004, 7 February 2005 and 16 April 2014 ); in this sense, under the Constitution, the right of access to a court was absolute (ruling of 30 June 2000); it could not be artificially limited or made extremely difficult to implement (ruling of 13 December 2004). If this constitutional right was not ensured, the general principle of ubi ius, ibi remedium would be breached (decision of 8 August 2006). Violated constitutional rights could be defended in court regardless of whether they were mentioned in a statute or substatutory legislation (ruling of 23 June 1999).

Approving the Management Plan the Government implemented the State power, and the lawfulness of such act had to be decided by the Constitutional Court.

They could also have asked the courts to rescind the purchase agreement in respect of the buildings. The Government referred to the decision of the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, indicating that the applicant company had chosen the wrong remedy to protect its rights ( see paragraph 36 above ). The actions of the applicant company, namely its efforts to acquire planning permission for reconstruction of or major repair work on the buildings, to get the authorities to agree to its proposed changes to the detailed plan and to include the area in the landscape management recreational zone had been inappropriate as they had not been in compliance with domestic law."

With regard to the case in issue, the Court notes that the central tenet of the applicant company ’ s complaint is the allegedly unlawful and unjustified interference with its property rights on account of the authorities ’ refusal to allow it to reconstruct or carry out major repair work on its buildings and their failure to set time-limits and establish a compensation mechanism for the demolition of the buildings. In respect of that complaint, the applicant company pursued a number of available legal remedies before the administrative and judicial authorities (see paragraphs 12, 16 - 19, 23 - 24, 31, 33 - 34, 27, 39 and 41 above). It also applied for compensation for the pecuniary damage it had sustained as a result of the fact that it had been unable to do anything with the buildings (see paragraph 34 above). The domestic courts never stated that the authorities had acted unlawfully by including the buildings in the list of objects to be privatised and the Court is not convinced that the remedy under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code, referred to by the Government, would have been effective. The Court further observes that the Government refers in this respect to a decision by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court from 2016 while the application was lodged by the applicant company before the Court in 2014.

The buildings were situated in the Curonian Spit National Park, which was established in 1991 and included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2000 (until then it was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List) (see paragraph 69 above). This fact means that the State ’ s margin of discretion depended on its obligations to UNESCO and there are no doubts that the measures that have to be taken in respect of the UNESCO territory could be rigorous."

The applicant company ’ s buildings were designated for demolition in the development plan of 1994, six years prior to the purchase and the restrictions preventing the development of the property were already in existence when the applicant company acquired it (see paragraphs 8, 51 - 53 above). Although a number of provisions of the development plan have been changed by the Management Plan in 2012, the provisions concerning the applicant company ’ s buildings remained unchanged since 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The Court thus considers that the applicant company knew, or should reasonably have known, that under the domestic law in force at the time when it bought the buildings in question, the property was designated for demolition and although the date of the demolition had not been set, it had to take place at some point in time. The whole text and schemes of the development plan were accessible to all those who wanted to access them (see paragraph 69 above). The applicant company thus could not reasonably have expected to obtain planning permission to redevelop the buildings, in particular to reconstruct them by changing their designation, function or size, even if such possibility might have been considered at some point in time (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) and must already have accepted the risk at the time of purchase because the demolition had to take place at some point in time. Contrary to the applicant company ’ s arguments, as is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the Management Plan of 2012 did not change the designation of the property, and its classification has not changed since. The applicant company thus was never entitled to any compensation for demolition of the buildings, irrespective of when such demolition had to take place."

The Court thus considers that the interference with the applicant company ’ s peaceful enjoyment of its property was accompanied in the present case by sufficient procedural guarantees affording to it a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case to the relevant judicial authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision (see Sourlas v.

However, in the Court ’ s view this did not constitute either an implicit acknowledgment of a breach of the Convention or redress for the period during which the applicants were unable to use their plot of land and the domestic authorities were not proceeding with the expropriation. The Court further considers that there was no acknowledgment, either explicitly or in substance, of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the context of the preceding domestic proceedings. In its decision of 22 October 2009 the Pest County Regional Court held that the dismissal of the applicants ’ expropriation request by the Central Hungarian Regional Administration Office was based on an erroneous application of the law and a similarly erroneous assessment of the facts.

Apart from these constraints, the domestic authorities failed to proceed with the expropriation of the property for an excessive length of time, despite their legal obligation to do so. The applicants submitted that the combined effects of these measures had resulted in their property being subject to a measure of control from elsewhere. The applicants did not contest the legitimacy of the establishment of a water protection zone in 2002. Nonetheless, according to them, they had a legitimate reason to believe that their land, subject to a number of restrictions while the measure was in force, would be expropriated shortly afterwards; the authorities ’ delay of nine years did not strike a fair balance between the individual and general interests involved. They also maintained that this situation did not give rise to any compensation."

Since it had been clear from the relevant law that the properties affected by the establishment of a water protection zone could not remain in the ownership of the applicants, any measure interfering with the applicant ’ s rights aimed at and amounted to a deprivation of property. Furthermore, even in the absence of a formal expropriation, regard must be had to the realities of the situation, that is the de facto expropriation of the applicants ’ property with effect from 2002 (see paragraph 3 1 above). Moreover, the case was to be distinguished from situations where expropriation of the applicants ’ property had been engaged but not carried out (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52 ), and where the Court examined the case under the first rule in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 98, ECHR 2000-I, and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, § 217, ECHR 2015)."

            [
                "43. In particular, the Court notes that following the adoption of a decision on the establishment of a water protection zone, the applicants ’ plot of land was designated as an inner protection zone by an entry in the land registry. The decision of the General Directorate of Water Management of 16 December 2002 informed the applicants that pursuant to section 15 (1) of Government Decree no. 123/1997(VII.18.) their plot of land should be expropriated with a view to establishing the same ownership over the water reserve and over the land where it was located. The decision did not set a time-limit for the measure (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). It also specified that the applicants could also initiate a transfer of ownership if the authorities failed to do so. Despite the eventual establishment of the water protection zone, the authorities did not expropriate the applicants ’ plot of land until 2011, but used it for water management purposes."
            ],
            [
                "44. Therefore, the establishment of the protection zone significantly reduced the effective exercise of the applicants ’ property right through restrictions on the use of property and through a ban on construction. These measures clearly amounted to a measure of control of the use of property, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, the applicants ’ complaint also relates to the authorities ’ failure to expropriate their land, despite a legal obligation and their request to do so. As a result, the applicants were not able to get the pecuniary compensation which would have been due in case of expropriation. The Court acknowledges in this respect that, over a long period of time, pending the adoption of the decision on expropriation, the applicants ’ right of property was precarious (see Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 60). However, until 16 December 2011, when the decision was taken, the applicants ’ ownership right had not disappeared. Thus, contrary to the arguments of the Government, the effects of the measures involved were not such that they could be equivalent to a formal or de facto deprivation of possessions. Although these measures did not all have the same legal effect and had different aims, the Court considers that they must be looked at together in the light of the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Matos e Silva, Lda., and Others v. Portugal, 16 September 1996, § 85, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV)."

Even after the applicants had offered their plot for sale on 16 November 2005, no steps were taken to complete the expropriation procedure, since, apparently, the applicants ’ attempt to have an authority designated to exercise jurisdiction over the matter did not yield any result (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In similar vein, the applicants ’ further offer of 31 October 2007 to sell their property to the State was to no avail (see paragraph 14 above). Finally, even after the confirmation of the administrative authorities ’ obligation to conclude the expropriation procedure by a court judgment on 22 October 2009 (see paragraph 17 above), National Asset Management Inc., the authority designated to conduct the expropriation, took no action for an additional period of two years, when the expropriation was finally enforced by the Pest County Government Office (see paragraph 21 above ); the authorities thus took no action for an additional period of time, until 16 December 2011. Thus, in addition to the detrimental effects of the establishment of a water protection zone on the exercise of their right to property, the applicants were left in a state of uncertainty as to the fate of their plot of land over a long period of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Frendo Randon and Others v.

It found that the lower court had taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of the mental suffering caused to the applicant, as well as the degree of guilt of the defendant.

The applicant submitted that although the domestic courts had found a violation of her rights, the award made in her favour had been too small to compensate for the physical and mental suffering caused to her and her family. Moreover, she submitted documents confirming that she had continued to have health problems after the events of 2005, such as an acute ulcer, chronic cholecystitis, uncompensated hypothyroidism and a metabolic disorder. She had been regularly treated since then for these conditions."

Moreover, they had decided the amount of compensation based on their direct knowledge of the case and on the basis of the parties ’ arguments and evidence. The applicant had been awarded compensation in respect of this breach of Article 8 and consequently no longer had victim status. The award made by the domestic courts had been reasonable in the light of the relatively short period of the applicant ’ s in-patient treatment and the lack of evidence of any long-lasting effects on the applicant."

                "15. As the Court has had previous occasion to remark, the concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers, inter alia, the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see, for instance, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 22, Series A no. 91, Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III and G.B. and R.B. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 16761/09, § 29, 18 December 2012 ). It has also found that “there is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, but where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue may arise under Article 8” (see, for instance, Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, § 40, Series A no. 172, López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C, Guerra and Others v. Italy, 19 February 1998, § 57, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). Moreover, “Article 8 may apply in environmental cases whether the pollution is directly caused by the State or whether State responsibility arises from the failure to regulate private industry properly. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants ’ rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar” ( Hatton and Others, cited above, § 98 )."

                "16. The Court recalls that it falls first to the national authorities to redress any alleged violation of the Convention. The question whether a person may still claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of the Convention essentially entails on the part of the Court an ex post facto examination of his or her situation. A decision or measure of the domestic authorities favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive her of her status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for instance, Ciorap v. Moldova (no. 2), no. 7481/06, § 18, 20 July 2010 ). The question whether the victim of a violation of the Convention has received reparation for the damage caused – comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention – is an important issue. It is the Court ’ s settled case-law that where the national authorities have found a violation and their decision constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress, the party concerned can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 179-181, ECHR 2006 ‑ V)."

                "17. In the present case, the Court notes that the parties did not dispute the domestic courts ’ findings concerning the violation of the applicant ’ s rights by the State-owned company. Considering the materials in the file, the Court finds that an interference with the applicant ’ s rights protected under Article 8 of the Convention has taken place since her physical integrity has been affected by an unhealthy environment (see paragraph 15 above). In assessing whether the Moldovan authorities discharged their positive obligation under that provision, the Court notes that the domestic courts provided a remedy in the form of establishing the company ’ s responsibility and awarding compensation. Without expressly relying on the Convention but referring to the in-hospital treatment and the physical and mental suffering caused to the applicant (see paragraph 8 above), those courts ’ judgments could be interpreted as finding in fact a breach of the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights, as also argued by the Government (see paragraph 14 above). The Court sees no reason to depart from those findings in this respect."

                "18. The only issue which remains to be determined is the amount of compensation. The first-instance court awarded the applicant the equivalent of EUR 648 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, referring to such criteria as the amount of physical and mental suffering caused (see paragraph 8 above). While confirming the findings of the first-instance court, the higher court halved the award made and the Supreme Court of Justice upheld that reduced award. The higher courts relied on the same elements (degree of harm), but arrived at a different conclusion concerning the amount to be awarded. No specific reasons were given for this reduction, except a reference to the degree of responsibility of the defendant."

The Court takes into account the Government ’ s argument concerning the relatively short period of in-patient treatment and the absence of evidence of long-term effects on the applicant. Nevertheless, she was kept in hospital for two weeks, which implies that she sustained a certain degree of mental and physical suffering. Moreover, it considers that the sum awarded by the domestic courts is considerably below the minimum generally awarded by the Court in cases in which it has found a violation of Article 8 in respect of the Republic of Moldova, even taking into account the differences between these decisions."
