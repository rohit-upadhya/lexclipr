Italy, no. 16318/07, § 27, 27 April 2010 ), considers that the applicant ’ s complaints should be analysed from the standpoint of Article 11 of the Convention read in the light of Article 9 (see Emin and Others v. Greece, no. 34144/05, § 18, 27 March 2008). This is because the central issue is the non-recognition by the respondent State of the applicant as a religious (legal) entity and its inability accordingly to act collectively in the religious sphere (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v.

As stated by the applicant association, after its abolition the territory over which the Ohrid Archdiocese had jurisdiction, which had included what is now the territory of the respondent State, fell under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which in 1918 issued a canonical release of those territories to the benefit of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC). As stated by the Government, in 1943 it was decided that the Ohrid Archdiocese would be restored and continued by an autonomous Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC). In 1959 the MOC seceded from the SOC, and in 1967 it declared autocephaly. The Head of the Holy Synod of MOC is designated as “Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia” ( Архиепископ Охридски и Македонски )."

The applicant association disagreed that the rejection of the agreement had resulted solely from the reaction by the public and submitted that “the main pressure came directly from the Macedonian authorities who stood behind the protests”."

                "(c) relying on the applicant association ’ s Charter, the Commission established that it would act as an autonomous religious group in canonical union with the Peć Patriarchy (SOC ). That the applicant association would operate as part of a foreign orthodox church was, in the Commission ’ s view, in violation of section 12 of the 1997 Act. The Commission further stated that a religious community could be established only by nationals of the respondent State, and not by a foreign church or State;",
                "(d) the applicant association had emerged from an already existing and registered religious community, notably the MOC, whose position and role had been specified in the Constitution. The fact that the applicant association had sought registration under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” had implied that its real intention was to create a parallel orthodox religious group to the MOC, which had been using that name (Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese) “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. That was not in compliance with section 8 (2) of the 1997 Act, under which only one religious community could be registered for one faith group. The Commission referred to a decision of the Constitutional Court which had found that provision compliant with the Constitution. It had ruled that the provision had protected people from being manipulated and same-faith believers from being divided into several religious groups ( U.br.223/97 of 28 October 1998, see paragraph 54 below). The Commission also argued that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that it was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese. This was confirmed on 17 July 1967 when the Ohrid Archdiocese declared autocephaly, which was continued by the MOC. The Commission further held that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Industrial Property Bureau (“the Bureau”, Завод за заштита на индустриската сопственост ) to register the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” in its trademark register (TM 2004/574).",

Its name did not specify whether it was a church, religious community or religious group.

That the applicant ’ s intended name implied that it was under the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign church was in contravention of the 2007 Act and other laws.

In this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the MOC, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 October 2008, had refused to change the name in its Constitution; (iii) that the MOC had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” as a trademark was irrelevant, since the Industrial Property Act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. In this connection, the applicant argued that, in any event, the Bureau had confirmed that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had requested registration of seventeen trademarks, including the trademark “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese”. However, the MOC had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought. Consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 April 2009. Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association ’ s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association ’ s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court ’ s interpretation that the expression “Greek” was an English translation of “Orthodox Church” was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which “Ohrid Archdiocese” had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated “(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.” It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely “Christian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia” and “Christian Adventist Church in Macedonia”. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that “had the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name”; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to."

In this connection, he claimed that the religious organisation with which he was affiliated had not been allowed registration for many years, and thus had been denied the opportunity to obtain legal- entity status. He stated “ I ’ m prevented from exercising my freedom of religious observance in association with other people on a voluntary basis .” He further argued that without legal-entity status the applicant association was prevented from enjoying certain statutory rights: it could not construct religious temples; its members could not conduct religious ceremonies; it could not instruct religion or create religious schools; and it could not manage its property, nor could it hold bank accounts. Bishop D. invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation. Since the Constitutional Court had already rejected a similar appeal lodged on behalf of several people (U.br.182/09, see paragraph 5 5 below), he consented that his appeal be regarded as being submitted only in his name.

It is so since the person concerned ( субјектот ) did not take any action in the court proceedings to comply with the statutory requirements, which apply similarly to all citizens. This derives from his request that this court suggest to him what needs to be done for (the applicant association ) to be registered, which implies knowledge that there were (certain) flaws which led to non-registration. The complainant was not a priori refused registration of his religious community by a final judicial decision. The refusal he received was for non-compliance with the statutory requirements.”"

Whether the court would decide a constitutional appeal on the merits depended on “(its) quality and the facts and evidence submitted in support”. They maintained that the application, in part concerning the refusal of the national authorities to register the applicant under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese”, was to be declared inadmissible, because the constitutional appeal filed by Bishop D. on 15 July 2007 had been rejected as belated, having been lodged outside the two-month time-limit specified in the Rules of the Constitutional Court.

A decision whereby the Constitutional Court recognised the standing of a similar association (see paragraph 5 5 above) was irrelevant since the court had examined that case in abstracto.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently in Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

The Rules of that court further specified that “any citizen” could seek protection from the Constitutional Court of the rights and freedoms set out in that Article. The relevant jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court demonstrates clearly that it had full jurisdiction to decide constitutional appeals submitted by physical persons (see paragraph 5 7 above). However, the domestic practice was somewhat uncertain when it comes to a constitutional appeal of an association or organisation through which individual members act collectively in a field of mutual interest. From the available material, it appears that the Constitutional Court initially declined jurisdiction to decide such appeals (see paragraphs 20, 3 6 and 5 5 above). This practice prevailed in 2009-2010 i.e. at the time when D.N., a founding member of the applicant association, lodged constitutional appeals which had relevance for the present case.

In the constitutional appeals he raised the grievances of which the applicant complained before the Court. The Constitutional Court rejected both appeals and provided extended reasons for its decisions. In its decision of 9 September 2009 the Constitutional Court explicitly stated that “it had no jurisdiction” to examine D.N. ’ s complaints regarding the authorities ’ refusal to recognise the applicant association as a religious entity under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” (see paragraph 20 above). D.N. ’ s second constitutional appeal regarding the non-registration of the applicant association as “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” was rejected since “the refusal (to register the applicant) was due to non-compliance with the statutory requirements ... ”. It concluded accordingly that “...

In the Court ’ s view, the above holdings of the national courts were focused on purely formalistic aspects, not on the substance of the application and, moreover, did not make clear what their exact import was for allowing the applicant ’ s registration. It must be noted that the 2007 Act defined a religious entity, organised in any of the allowed forms (a church, religious community or group), as a “voluntary association of physical persons” (section 2, see paragraph 48 above). On the facts of the case, it is clear that the founding members of the applicant (three physical persons), who were also members of its Holy Synod, the highest managerial body (section 6 of the Charter, see paragraph 2 7 above), gathered at the constituent assembly on 27 April 2009 in order to adopt relevant documents for the applicant association ’ s registration. At that meeting, they adopted the founding decision, which specified that the applicant association was “a voluntary association ... of Christians” (see paragraph 2 6 above). The registration court found such a practice to be contrary to the 2007 Act, notwithstanding that similar circumstances regarding the adoption of the founding decision of 1 September 2004 had not led the Commission in the first registration proceedings to refuse to register the applicant association (see paragraph 1 1 above). Furthermore, the 2007 Act did not require that the name of a religious entity seeking registration should indicate the specific form of its organisation."

Further, the Court cannot discern how the term “Archdiocese” included in the applicant association ’ s intended name placed the organisational form of the applicant association in conflict with the law. Lastly, it must be noted that the 2007 Act (section 1(2)) specified that religious entities, irrespective of their form of organisation, were equal before the law. To this extent, it also provided a single definition for all of them ( see section 2 (1) of the 2007 Act, paragraph 4 9 above )."

Section 13(1) of the 2007 Act required that a religious entity should specify “the seat and address ... in the respondent State”, which the applicant association did in the registration documents (see paragraph 2 7 above). This provision did not proscribe a religious entity to have a temporary seat. The court ’ s finding was inconsistent with the practice applied in the first registration proceedings by the Commission which did not point to the applicant association ’ s “temporary seat” as a formal deficiency precluding its registration (see paragraph 1 1 above). The registration court further did not explain how the lack of a separate decision on a person authorised to represent the applicant association made its registration impossible.

The Government added that the terms “Greek” and “Peć Patriarchy” included in the applicant association ’ s name suggested some connection of the applicant association with Greece and Serbia (see paragraph 91 above ) (see, mutatis mutandis, Emin and Others v.

After the 2007 Act entered into force, the applicant submitted a fresh application for registration, now under the name “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” (see paragraph 2 9 above). Section 10(1) of that Act provided that a religious organisation ’ s name should “be different” from the name of any other registered religious organisation (see paragraph 4 8 above). The registration court held that the intended name of the applicant was partly identical with the name of the “ Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese ” (see paragraph 3 1 (c) above)."

It is true that under the domestic law the relevant authorities were required to examine the application in the light of the statutory requirement precluding registration of a religious entity whose name did not (substantially) differ from the name of an already registered organisation. In the context of the freedom of association this is a relevant element since the name is among the most important elements identifying an association, be it religious or otherwise, and distinguishes it from other such organisations. In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br. 24/2012, paragraph 5 6 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that “the absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...” and “the aim of the statutory requirement that the name ... (is) not identical ... is to prevent confusion among believers, incorrect perceptions, and lawful indefinite division of same-faith believers ...” However, in the present case the name chosen for the applicant was sufficiently specific as to distinguish it from the Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese (see point 74 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 5 9 above). Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant association intended to identify itself with the MOC. On the contrary, during the impugned proceedings it had continuously and expressly refused to be confused or associated with the MOC (see paragraphs 1 5 (c), 2 6 and 3 3 above). Lastly, it appears that the public had been sufficiently informed about the applicant association, its leadership and the positions they represented, and that these were perceived as conflicting with those of the MOC (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above)."

The Commission held that the MOC had been using that name “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. It also found that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that MOC was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese and referred to the events of 1967 ( see paragraphs 5 and 1 3 (d)). In addition to these reasons, in the second registration proceedings the registration court added that only the MOC had the “historical, religious, moral and substantive right” to use that name (see paragraph 3 1 (c)). Following that line of reasoning, the Government maintained that the name “Ohrid Archdiocese” represented “an inextricable part of the genesis and current existence of the MOC” (see paragraph 90 above)."

The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above (see [ specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008]), the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is potentially addressed to different people.",
                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

It held that the report of 28 April 2010 was insufficiently reasoned and was based on assumptions. In particular, the experts had not explained what they understood by “a normal perception” and “possible aberrant perceptions by emotionally unstable or easily suggestible people”. It was not clear what the experts meant when saying that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord associated with violence or as calls to violence”, that “the book [ did ] not contain any ideas which could be definitely interpreted as propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation”, or that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as statements aiming to humiliate persons on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, native language, origin, attitude to religion, affiliation to a social group or on any other basis”. The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements. Lastly, the District Court noted the absence of a linguist or a philologist in the panel of experts. In the court ’ s view, that omission undermined the comprehensive nature of the study."

On 2 July 2013 the Constitutional Court, in its decision no. 1053-O, dismissed as inadmissible a request for a review of the constitutionality of sections 1 and 13 of the Suppression of Extremism Act – in particular, the parts of section 1 concerning incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of people on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion – on the grounds of their alleged vagueness and the consequent lack of foreseeability in their application. The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

Declaring a piece of material extremist meant that it breached anti-extremism legislation and for that reason alone presented a real danger to human rights and freedoms, to the foundations of the constitutional regime and the safety and security of the Russian Federation. Therefore, each judicial decision on the matter had to be followed by the seizure of the material declared extremist in order to exclude access to such material and thereby prevent the risk of their negative influence on persons, including their owners.

For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website.

This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race.

When it comes to statements, certain elements should be taken into consideration in deciding if a given statement constitutes an insult or amounts to hate speech: the context in which it is made; the public to which it is addressed; whether the statement was made by a person in his or her official capacity, in particular if this person carries out particular functions. ..",
                "70. As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",
                "72. As concerns the content, the Venice Commission wishes to underline that in a democratic society, religious groups must tolerate, as other groups must, critical public statements and debate about their activities, teachings and beliefs, provided that such criticism does not amount to incitement to hatred and does not constitute incitement to disturb the public peace or to discriminate against adherents of a particular religion.",
                "73. Having said so, the Venice Commission does not support absolute liberalism. While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated. Since the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities, it is legitimate to expect from every member of a democratic society to avoid as far as possible expressions that express scorn or are gratuitously offensive to others and infringe their rights ...",

The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",
                "Article 1.1 point 3: ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",

                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",

This provision defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",

It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context.

Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others.

Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse.

The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order. Their statement that there was such a risk was purely hypothetical and was not based on any facts. They had not therefore justified the “necessity in a democratic society” of banning the books."

Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104; and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 124, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."

Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one ’ s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 73; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105; and S.A.S. v.

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone ’ s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106). The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups. That concerns both relations between believers and non ‑ believers and relations between the adherents of various religions, faiths and beliefs (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 60, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court has also stressed that the State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127, with further references). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v.

The State ’ s responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 may therefore be engaged only in extreme cases where the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs is such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them (see Otto-Preminger-Institut, loc. cit.)."

For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v.

What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

Although the court reiterated the experts ’ finding that the books contained expressions giving “humiliating depictions, an unfavourable assessment and a negative evaluation of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion”, it did not quote any such expressions. Nor did it discuss the necessity of banning the books, having regard to the context in which they were published, their nature and wording, and their potential to lead to harmful consequences (see paragraph 99 above). Moreover, the District Court did not even mention, let alone discuss at any length, the effect of the ban on the applicants ’ rights under Articles and 9 and 10 of the Convention or its domestic-law equivalent (see, for similar reasoning, Perinçek, cited above, § 277)."

Indeed, the District Court summarily rejected all evidence submitted by them, including the opinions of Muslim authorities and Islamic studies scholars who explained the historical context in which the books had been written, their place in the body of Islamic religious literature, in particular the fact that they belonged to moderate rather than radical Islam, their importance for the Russian Muslim community and their general message of tolerance, interreligious cooperation and opposition to violence (see paragraphs 11 - 13, 17 and 23 above). Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II) or where the domestic courts had dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner, thereby stripping him of the procedural protection that he had been entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 116). It does not see any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

Lastly, the Court takes note of the appellate court ’ s observation that the ban concerned the specific editions of the Risale-I Nur Collection, rather than Said Nursi ’ s teachings as such (see paragraph 26 above). However, the fact that the domestic courts did not indicate what passages they considered “extremist” makes it impossible for the applicants to re - publish the books after editing out the problematic passages. The domestic decisions therefore amounted to an absolute ban on publishing and distributing the books in question."

It relied in this connection on the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 prepared by a philologist, a psychologist and a doctor of philosophy in religious studies from the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University (see paragraph 29 above)."

Indeed, although it quoted the specialists ’ report at some length rather than simply reproducing its conclusions, it still endorsed the specialists ’ findings – which also clearly went beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues and provided a legal qualification of the text instead – without making any meaningful assessment of those findings and without conducting its own legal analysis of the text in question.

However, by contrast to the Koptevskiy District Court, the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court quoted several of the expressions which were considered “extremist” by the specialists and were accordingly declared as such by the court. Relying on the specialists ’ report, the District Court noted, in particular, that Muslims were described in the book positively as “the faithful” and “the just”, while everyone else was described negatively as “the dissolute”, “the philosophers”, “the idle talkers” and “little men”. The book also proclaimed that not to be a Muslim was an “infinitely big crime”. The District Court concluded from those expressions that the book treated non-Muslims as inferior to Muslims."

Although the Court accepts that some people might be offended by such statements, it reiterates that merely because a remark may be perceived as offensive or insulting by particular individuals or groups does not mean that it constitutes “hate speech”. Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, § 57, ECHR 2008). The key issue in the present case is thus whether the statements in question, when read as a whole and in their context, could be seen as promoting violence, hatred or intolerance ( see Perinçek, cited above, § 240)."

The Court notes that the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court did not assess the statements in question in the light of the book as a whole; it quoted them out of their immediate textual context and failed to examine which idea they sought to impart. In particular, it did not take into account the fact that they were part of a religious text and that, according to the experts, such statements were common in religious texts because any monotheistic religion was “characterised by a psychologically based belief in the superiority of its world - view over all other world - views, which made it necessary to substantiate the choice of that world - view” (see paragraph 32 above), in particular by claiming that it was better than the others. The District Court found that observation irrelevant, noting that it “had not asked for a comparative study” (see paragraph 37 above)."

The Court further reiterates that religious groups cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism; they must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see the general principles cited in paragraph 93 above). The same principle applies to non-religious ideologies, including atheism and agnosticism. Although the impugned statements clearly promoted the idea that it was better to be a Muslim than a non-Muslim, it is significant that they did not insult, hold up to ridicule or slander non-Muslims; nor did they use abusive terms in respect of them or of matters regarded as sacred by them (see, for a similar reasoning, Aydın Tatlav, cited above, § 28; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş., cited above; and Kutlular, cited above, §§ 48 and 49; see also, by contrast, İ.A. v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the use of military metaphors in the text, in the absence of the other elements mentioned in paragraph 99 above, is insufficient to make that text amount to “hate speech” or calls to violence (compare Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that freedom to manifest one ’ s religion includes the right to try to convince one ’ s neighbour, for example through “ teaching ”, failing which “ freedom to change [one ’ s] religion or belief ”, enshrined in Article 9, would be likely to remain a dead letter (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31). It was never argued in the present case that the content of the book amounted to, or encouraged, improper proselytism, that is attempting to convert people through the use of violence, brainwashing or taking advantage of those in distress or in need (ibid., § 48). Nor was it claimed that the book advocated any activities going beyond promoting religious worship and observance in private life of the requirements of Islam, or sought to reorganise the functioning of society as a whole by imposing on everyone its religious symbols or conception of a society founded on religious precepts ( see, for a similar reasoning, Gündüz, cited above, § 51, and compare and contrast Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v. Russia, nos. 26261/05 and 26377/06, § 112, 14 March 2013 ).
