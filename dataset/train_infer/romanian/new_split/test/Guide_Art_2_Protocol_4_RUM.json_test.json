In the present case, the first applicant and Mr X. had joint custody over the second applicant. In consequence, they were in principle both authorised and capable of enabling the second applicant ’ s travel, had it not been for any restrictions imposed by the national courts."

Joint custody and support from children ’ s services allowed the creation of an educational programme for the parents to allow for the growth and well - being of the child.

The ensuing report of 8 February 2008 considered that Mr X. was having difficulty seeing the child, as for a while the mother had unilaterally interrupted the father ’ s visits ( for example, nine out of fourteen overnight stays with the father had not occurred and six consecutive Sunday visits had been missed), and that the mother was not cooperating with children ’ s services. Consequently, the establishment of an educational programme had not been successful. It found on the one hand that the first applicant ’ s anger towards the father was persistent and involved the child. On the other hand the father had shown consideration and put the needs of the child first. He sincerely loved his daughter and was cooperating with children ’ s services. The father and the child had a warm and caring relationship, and the child felt comfortable and happy in his presence. It appeared however that the child might have fears of losing her loved ones, probably due to the various moves, which had also detached her from members of her extended family. The report therefore advised the grant of temporary sole custody to the father, with regular supervised visits by the mother, until this could be reversed. It concluded that schooling should be in accordance with the custody decision, as this would be favourable to the child ’ s emotional stability, notwithstanding the unfortunate moves of house.

The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention had detailed provisions regarding criminal proceedings, but nothing in relation to civil proceedings. Thus, it was a matter subject solely to ordinary law. That being stated, he considered that in the instant case there had not been a breach of the right to defence or to the right to cross- examination ( contraddittorio ). Indeed, the first applicant had originally been represented at the opening of the hearing, thus, the prerequisites existed to hear the case and to cross- examine. It was only following the rejection of the request for an adjournment that the first applicant ’ s co- lawyer forfeited her mandate. Moreover, when the latter forfeited her mandate she was not forfeiting her colleague ’ s mandate, who therefore remained counsel to the applicant. The court further noted that there existed no law recognising a right to defer a case. The decision in relation to the existence of a legitimate impairment was subject to the judge ’ s discretion after hearing the relevant arguments. In the present case, the results of the investigation and rogatory enquiry with the Rimini Tribunal could not lead to the existence either of a legitimate impediment or of an ex post one. The Commissario della Legge had according to his prerogatives considered it opportune to decide the case speedily in view of the urgency and gravity of the matter. Indeed, it shared the view that, there not being any legal and binding procedural requirements in this respect, in the urgent circumstances of the case the decision could have been taken even in the absence of one of the parties ( audi alteram partem ). Moreover, the appeal judge considered perplexing the fact that the first applicant was contesting a situation she had created herself.

Thus, the impugned decision had been taken in the best interest of the child, having considered that the father was the parent who would have allowed contact with the other parent. The court ’ s conclusion had been based on the objective findings by children ’ s services following their monitoring of the parent-child relationships, which repeatedly found that the mother was hindering the child ’ s contact with the father, to the extent that in 2009 they feared the second applicant was suffering from Parental Alienation Syndrome (paragraph 9 7 above )."

Some of these cases had turned out to be extremely alarming from the point of view of the right to joint parenting and regular contact rights. These complaints mainly concerned children ’ s services. During the association ’ s discussions on child custody, strong criticisms of children ’ s services were voiced by parents, in particular in respect of their lack of qualifications and ineffective support for parents. Many spoke about their distressing experiences in trying to see their children, particularly in cases of parents with dual nationality, who publicly complained that they had faced discriminatory treatment from the services. The association therefore invited children ’ s services and the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Council”) to attend subsequent sessions.

The association also considered that it was anomalous for the staff of children ’ s services to assume conflicting roles, namely the function of public officials reporting to judges and also as mediators providing support for families and children.

The mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other ’ s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life even when the relationship between the parents has broken down (see Keegan v. Ireland, 26 May 1994, § 50, Series A no. 290 ). Family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child ’ s liberty. Thus, the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (see Nielsen v. Denmark, 28 November 1988, § 61, Series A no. 144 )."

Poland, no. 48542/99, § 53, 23 June 2005 ). The Court has repeatedly held that Article 8 includes a right for parents to have measures taken with a view to their being reunited with their children, and an obligation on the national authorities to take such measures.

Finland, 23 September 1994, § 55, Series A no. 299-A). Moreover, lack of cooperation between separated parents is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt the authorities from their positive obligations under Article 8. It rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the paramount interests of the child ( see Zawadka, cited above, § 67) which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent (see Hoppe v.

Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as “necessary” within the meaning of Article 8 ( see W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 62 and 64 in fine ). In conducting its review in the context of Article 8 the Court may also have regard to the length of the local authority ’ s decision-making process and of any related judicial proceedings. An effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined solely in the light of all relevant considerations and not by the mere passage of time ( ibid. , § 65; see also H. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, § 90, Series A no. 120 )."

However, by an order of 21 September 2007 the domestic courts decided that the second applicant should reside in San Marino, as Mr X. had the right to easy and unsupervised contact with his child. On 12 November 2007 joint custody was upheld as being in the best interest of the child. By a decision of 19 February 2008, the court, again upheld joint custody and ordered the child to be returned to San Marino to live with her father and to attend school there. This decision was confirmed on appeal three years later. In the meantime a number of orders had been issued on the matter, upholding joint custody and residence with the father, in San Marino."

Following that date contact hours increased to two to six hours per day, overnight stays, and alternate weekends with the parents, up to entire weeks over the Christmas holiday period.

In each of their decisions they relied on detailed and complete reports from the children ’ s services (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 28, 38, 50 and 77 ) which were drawn up following constant and specific requests by the domestic courts. These reports were a result of the constant monitoring performed by the service. From 2007 onwards the courts further had the benefits of reports by ex-parte counsellors and experts, and from 2008 onwards also reports by the CTU. Moreover, the parties had regularly made written and oral submissions before the court and were allowed to air all their requests and concerns, which the courts undoubtedly took into consideration."

It is also noted that the domestic courts did not exclude a change in regime if circumstances so required. Furthermore, the domestic courts took due care to recommend education programmes for the family and to foster the parents ’ reconciliation and co-operation in the best interest of their daughter."

                "185. As to contact rights, the Court has already observed the details of the regime applied (see paragraph 180 above ). It reiterates that the national authorities having the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned are better placed than the international judge to assess such needs. The Court considers that the measures adopted do not appear manifestly arbitrary or unfair. In consequence, it is not for the Court to enter into a detailed assessment of the most appropriate contact arrangements. It suffices for the Court to note that these rights were not denied or suppressed at any moment, the applicants having maintained constant and regular contact with each other, and the first applicant having retained joint custody over the second applicant. While supervision and often limitation as to the venue of contact meetings (the father ’ s residence), must have restricted the purpose of visits between mother and child, limiting to some extent their contact and the opportunity to develop their relationship - a matter which was in both of their interests and particularly the child ’ s, whose interest is paramount - the Court considers that monitoring by the child services was necessary to allow the domestic courts to make informed decisions as to custody and contact rights. Moreover, such monitoring also served to ensure the child ’ s well being. The Court is ready to accept that while there was no threat of violence or serious health issues (see, a contrario, Gluhaković v. Croatia, no. 21188/09, § 63, 12 April 2011 ) there could have been a risk of psychological abuse as evidenced by the suggestions that the child might develop Parent Alienation Syndrome, thus justifying the father ’ s presence at meetings. This having been said, the Court refutes the Government ’ s argument that such limitations were necessary as a precautionary measure against a possible abduction by the first applicant. The Court notes that when the first applicant moved to San Marino, she had informed the judge (see paragraph 26), similarly, when requested to submit the second applicant ’ s passport she did so (see paragraph 56). While she appeared to be more hesitant to submit the second passport, the Court notes that in the meantime it was Mr X. who had requested a second passport and who was allowed to travel with the child (see paragraphs 70 and 92). Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated by the courts that travel was banned unless authorised by it (see paragraphs 51, 70 and 99), a measure which in principle deterred unilateral decisions to take the child away. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which gives objective grounds for any fear of the applicants ’ absconding, particularly since the first applicant ’ s family lived in Rimini, not far from San Marino, and indeed any mere suspicions or fears which Mr X. might have had had neither been substantiated nor confirmed by the courts. Lastly, the Court notes that the presence of the parties ’ lawyers had not been court ordered, and indeed it was the children ’ s services that requested the court to prohibit such a practice (see paragraph 69 above). Thus, any discomfort caused in this respect could have easily been avoided by the parties ’ good will."

While it is true that the domestic courts have a duty to exercise constant vigilance, particularly as regards action taken by social services, to ensure the latter ’ s conduct does not defeat the authorities ’ decisions (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], cited above, § 179), the Court notes that in the present case, the applicants had ample possibilities to criticise and contest the children ’ s services qualifications, actions and findings in the contentious proceedings, as in fact the first applicant had done in relation to the children ’ s services failure to facilitate her contact rights (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 56 above).

As to the hearing of 19 February 2008 on the merits of her and Mr X. ’ s requests, the Court considers that given the fact that the first applicant ’ s representative had been duly notified of the date of the hearing (see paragraph 43 above), that at the actual hearing she had originally been represented by co-counsel, and that she had had the opportunity to submit written pleadings, it cannot be said that her involvement had not been effective at that stage. This is more so in view of the fact that in cases concerning a person ’ s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. In this light, and bearing in mind that the decision of 19 February 2008 only confirmed the retention of a joint custody regime which had previously been decided (see paragraphs 28 and 38 above ) the Court finds reasonable the refusal of the domestic court to adjourn the hearing."

As to the overall length of the proceedings the Court notes that the first applicant intervened in the custody and contact proceedings in December 2006 and the proceedings are to date still pending. However, it is evident from the facts of the case that there have not been any significant lapses of inactivity, or adjournments for reasons related to internal organisation (see, a contrario Veljkov v.

Indeed it also transpires that the parties ’ requests for urgent hearings had been immediately followed up, with the domestic courts calling on extraordinary hearings of their own motion when necessary (see, for example, paragraph 43 above). Thus, although parallel proceedings and the fact that the courts had to decide a number of ancillary matters simultaneously must have detracted from the required speediness of custody proceedings, the Court considers that overall the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the proceedings with the requisite diligence."

The only reason given by the domestic court for such a refusal was that the applicant had no right to such materials, children ’ s services being the judge ’ s auxiliary (see paragraph 77 above). The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning and no other compelling reasons supporting their refusal to provide the video recordings have been put forward. However, it notes that nine months later the parties ’ requests for CTU recordings and all relevant documentation had been granted (see paragraph 10 4 above), thus, the first applicant could make use of such relevant information for the purposes of the proceedings which were still ongoing.

Thus, freedom of movement prohibits any measure liable to infringe that right or to restrict the exercise thereof which is not “in accordance with the law” and does not satisfy the requirement of a measure which can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” in the pursuit of the legitimate aims referred to in the third and fourth paragraph of the above-mentioned Article (see Baumann v.

Although this Court will have regard to the domestic courts ’ related findings of fact, it does not consider itself bound by their legal conclusions as to whether the applicant was detained or not, not least because the House of Lords considered the question from the point of view of the tort of false imprisonment (see paragraph 39 above) rather than the Convention concept of “deprivation of liberty” in Article 5 § 1, the criteria for assessing those domestic and Convention issues being different.",

The majority of the House of Lords specifically distinguished actual restraint of a person (which would amount to false imprisonment) and restraint which was conditional upon his seeking to leave (which would not constitute false imprisonment). The Court does not consider such a distinction to be of central importance under the Convention. Nor, for the same reason, can the Court accept as determinative the fact relied on by the Government that the regime applied to the applicant (as a compliant incapacitated patient) did not materially differ from that applied to a person who had the capacity to consent to hospital treatment, neither objecting to their admission to hospital. The Court reiterates that the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of Convention protection for the single reason that he may have given himself up to be taken into detention ( see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 36, §§ 64-65), especially when it is not disputed that that person is legally incapable of consenting to, or disagreeing with, the proposed action."

As to the basis upon which a hospital was entitled to treat, and to care for, patients who were admitted as informal patients under section 131(1) but lacked the capacity to consent to such treatment or care, Lord Goff stated as follows :",

Moreover, the doctors in charge would, of course, owe a duty of care to such a patient in their care. Such treatment and care can, in my opinion, be justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity ... ( Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1 ) It is not therefore necessary to find such justification in the [1983 Act] itself, which is silent on the subject. It might, I imagine, be possible to discover an implication in the statute providing similar justification; but even assuming that to be right, it is difficult to imagine that any different result would flow from such a statutory implication. For present purposes, therefore, I think it appropriate to base justification for treatment and care of such patients on the common - law doctrine.”"

                "“At 11 o ’ clock on 22 July 1997 I was contacted by ... [the] social worker and [the applicant ’ s] case manager. She advised me that there had been an incident at Cranstock Day Centre, where [the applicant] had been attending since 1995, when [the applicant] had seriously self-harmed and was extremely disturbed. She said that he had to be sent to the Accident & Emergency Department and she requested assistance from the psychiatric services to assess [the applicant] with a view to admitting him if necessary. One of my team members, [Dr P. ], staff grade psychiatrist, attended the Accident & Emergency Department as requested. His notes state that he took a history from ... the team manager at Cranstock Day Centre who reported that since March 1997 [the applicant ’ s] episodes of self-injurious behaviour had increased in severity. On 22 July 1997 whilst he was at Cranstock he had been agitated, hyperventilating, pacing up and down and hitting himself on the head with his fists. He was also banging his head on the wall. The whole area had to be evacuated to avoid disturbance and assure the safety of others. He was given 4 mgs of Diazepam to try to calm him down at the time but this had no effect. The GP was therefore called who administered 5 mgs of Zimovane. However he still remained agitated in the Accident & Emergency Department. He was assessed and treated at A & E. [Dr P. ] later assessed [the applicant] as being agitated and very anxious. He noted redness of both his temples, that he was punching his head with both his fists at times and hyperventilating. [Dr P. ] assessed that [the applicant] required in-patient treatment and transferred [the applicant] to the Behavioural Unit. [Dr P. ] noted that [the applicant] ‘ makes no attempt to leave ’. I recorded that we considered whether it was necessary to detain [the applicant] under the Mental Health Act 1983 but it was decided that this was not necessary as he was, as I noted at the time, ‘ quite compliant ’ and had ‘ not attempted to run away ’. He was therefore admitted as an informal patient. If [the applicant] had resisted admission I would certainly have detained him under the [1983] Act as I was firmly of the view that he required in-patient treatment. This was clearly thought through and supported following discussion with [Dr P. ], ward staff, other professionals and the Care Services Manager.

On 23 July Dr M. wrote to Mr and Mrs E. and in her letter invited them to come and meet her the following week when it was her intention to discuss the possibility of phased visits, but they did not accept this invitation to meet her.

[The applicant] has always accepted his medication which has always been administered orally. He was also fully compliant when blood was taken from him for testing. He did not however cooperate with the attempts that were made to carry out a CT scan and EEG, which were necessary in view of his old history of fits and temporal lobe abnormality, on 5 and 6 August 1997 and so these tests were abandoned. [The applicant] cooperated to a certain extent with the speech therapy assessment which was carried out on 15 September 1997 and the occupational therapy assessment. However, as soon as he showed any signs of distress the assessments were postponed and reviewed. [The applicant] is accommodated on an unlocked ward and has never attempted to leave the hospital but has accepted the change in his environment very well and is not distressed by it ... It was, in my professional opinion, in [the applicant ’ s] best interests to be admitted on 22 July 1997 and it is also in his best interests to continue with in-patient treatment to prevent further deterioration of his mental health. His discharge at this point in time would therefore be against medical advice. At the time of and since admission [the applicant] has been fully compliant with treatment and never indicated that he wishes to leave the hospital. In view of this it has not been necessary to detain him under the Act ... If [the applicant] stopped cooperating or indicated a wish to leave then I would have to consider at that time whether his condition warranted detention under section 3 of the Act. As these circumstances have not so far arisen detention has not been necessary.”"

                "42. Lord Goff considered that, in the light of the above account by Dr M., the following conclusions might be drawn:",
                "“The first is that, as I have already recorded, although [the applicant] had been discharged from hospital into the community on a trial basis, and on that basis had gone to live with Mr and Mrs E. as his paid carers, nevertheless he had not been finally discharged. It followed that the appellant trust remained responsible for his treatment, and that it was in discharge of that responsibility that the steps described by Dr M. were taken. The second is that when, on 22 July, [the applicant] became agitated and acted violently, an emergency in any event arose which called for intervention, as a matter of necessity, in his best interests and, at least in the initial stages, to avoid danger to others. Plainly it was most appropriate that the appellant trust, and Dr M. in particular, should intervene in these circumstances; certainly Mr and Mrs E., as [the applicant ’ s] carers, could not assert any superior position. Third, I have no doubt that all the steps in fact taken, as described by Dr M. , were in fact taken in the best interests of [the applicant] and, in so far as they might otherwise have constituted an invasion of his civil rights, were justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity.",
                "I wish to add that the latter statement is as true of any restriction upon his freedom of movement as then occurred, as it is of any touching of his person. There were times during the episode when it might be said that [the applicant] was ‘ detained ’ in the sense that, in the absence of justification, the tort of false imprisonment would have been committed. I have particularly in mind the journey by ambulance from the Day Centre to the Accident and Emergency Unit. But that journey was plainly justified by necessity, as must frequently be so in the case of removal to hospital by ambulance of unfortunate people who have been taken ill or suffered injury and as a result are incapacitated from expressing consent. I wish further to add that I cannot see that Dr M. ’ s statements to the effect that she would if necessary have taken steps compulsorily to detain [the applicant] under the Act of 1983 have any impact on the above conclusions. Those concerned with the treatment and care of mentally disordered persons must always have this possibility in mind although, like Dr M. , they will know that this power is only to be exercised in the last resort and they may hope, as in the present case, that it would prove to be unnecessary to exercise it. Such power, if exercised in accordance with the statute, is of course lawful. In the present case all the steps in fact taken by Dr M. were, in my opinion, lawful because justified under the common - law doctrine of necessity, and this conclusion is unaffected by her realisation that she might have to invoke the statutory power of detention.",
                "Finally, the readmission of [the applicant] to hospital as an informal patient under section 131(1) of the Act of 1983 could not, in my opinion, constitute the tort of false imprisonment. His readmission, as such, did not constitute a deprivation of his liberty. As Dr M. stated in paragraph 9 of her affidavit, he was not kept in a locked ward after he was admitted. And the fact that she, like any other doctor in a situation such as this, had it in her mind that she might thereafter take steps to detain him compulsorily under the Act, did not give rise to his detention in fact at any earlier date. Furthermore, his treatment while in hospital was plainly justified on the basis of the common - law doctrine of necessity. It follows that none of these actions constituted any wrong against [the applicant].”"

                "“ ... the function of the common - law doctrine of necessity [lies] in justifying actions which might otherwise be tortious, and so has the effect of providing a defence to actions in tort. The importance of this was, I believe, first revealed in the judgments in Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1. I wish, however, to express my gratitude to counsel for the appellants ... for drawing to our attention three earlier cases in which the doctrine was invoked, viz. Rex v. Coate (1 772) Lofft 73, especially at p. 75, per Lord Mansfield, Scott v. Wakem (1862) 3 F. and F. 328, 333, per Bramwell B., and Symm v. Fraser (1863) 3 F. and F. 859, 883, per Cockburn CJ, all of which provide authority for the proposition that the common law permitted the detention of those who were a danger, or potential danger, to themselves or others, in so far as this was shown to be necessary. I must confess that I was unaware of these authorities though, now that they have been drawn to my attention, I am not surprised that they should exist. The concept of necessity has its role to play in all branches of our law of obligations – in contract (see the cases on agency of necessity), in tort (see Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1), and in restitution (see the sections on necessity in the standard books on the subject) – and in our criminal law. It is therefore a concept of great importance. It is perhaps surprising, however, that the significant role it has to play in the law of torts has come to be recognised at so late a stage in the development of our law.”"

In my view, this case falls on the wrong side of any reasonable line that can be drawn between what is or what is not imprisonment or detention. The critical facts are as follows: (1) When on 22 July 199 7 at the Day Centre [the applicant] became agitated and started injuring himself, he was sedated and then physically supported and taken to the hospital. Even before sedation he was unable to express dissent to his removal to hospital. (2) Health care professionals exercised effective power over him. If [the applicant] had physically resisted, the psychiatrist would immediately have taken steps to ensure his compulsory admission. (3) In hospital staff regularly sedated him. That ensured that he remained tractable. This contrasts with the position when he was with carers: they seldom resorted to medication and then only in minimal doses. (4) The psychiatrist vetoed visits by the carers to [the applicant]. She did so, as she explained to the carers, in order to ensure that [the applicant] did not try to leave with them. The psychiatrist told the carers that [the applicant] would be released only when she, and other health care professionals, deemed it appropriate.

                "“It is now necessary to consider whether there was lawful authority to justify the detention and any treatment of [the applicant]. This is a matter of statutory construction. But it is important to approach the mental health legislation against the context of the principles of the common law. The starting - point of the common law is that when a person lacks capacity, for whatever reason, to take decisions about medical treatment, it is necessary for other persons, with appropriate qualifications, to take such decision for him: Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1, at 55H, per Lord Brandon of Oakbrook. The principle of necessity may apply. For the purposes of the present case it has been assumed by all counsel that the requirements of the principle are simply that (1) there must be ‘ a necessity to act when it is not practicable to communicate with the assisted person ’ and (2) ‘ that the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all circumstances take, acting in the best interests of the assisted person ’ : Re F. , supra, per Lord Goff of Chieveley, at 75H. There was not unanimity on this point in Re F. But I am content to approach the matter in the same way as counsel did ... Against this common - law background the Percy Report recommended a shift from the ‘ legalism ’ whereby hospital patients were ‘ certified ’ by special procedures, to a situation in which most patients would be ‘ informally ’ received in hospital, the term ‘ informally ’ signifying ‘ without any legal formality ’. This was to be achieved by replacing the existing system ‘ by the offer of care, without deprivation of liberty, to all who need it and are not unwilling to receive it ’ : see Report of the Royal Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness and Mental Deficiency (1954-1957) ... The desired objective was to avoid stigmatising patients and to avoid where possible the adverse effects of ‘ sectioning ’ patients. Where admission to hospital was required compulsion was to be regarded as a measure of last resort. The Mental Health Act of 1959 introduced the recommended changes. Section 5(1) was the critical provision. ... Counsel appearing on behalf of [the applicant] accepted that the effect of section 5 was to leave in place the common - law principle of necessity as a justification for informally receiving in hospital or mental nursing homes compliant incapacitated patients.",

By section 131(1) of the Act of 1983 the provisions of section 5(1) of the Act of 1959 were re-enacted verbatim. ... Prima facie section 131(1) must be given the same meaning as section 5(1). On this basis, section 131(1) also preserved the common - law principle of necessity as a means of admitting compliant incapacitated individuals. But counsel for [the applicant] submitted that section 131(1), unlike its predecessor, only applies to consenting capacitated patients. He argued that contextual differences between the statutes of 1959 and 1983 required the court to interpret the language of section 131(1) of the Act of 1983 in a narrower sense than section 5(1) of the Act of 1959. ... On orthodox principles of statutory interpretation the conclusion cannot be avoided that section 131(1) permits the admission of compliant incapacitated patients where the requirements of the principle of necessity are satisfied. Having had the benefit of the fuller argument produced by the intervention of the Secretary of State, I have to accept that the view of the Court of Appeal on the meaning of section 131(1) cannot be upheld.”"

It places effective and unqualified control in the hands of the hospital psychiatrist and other health care professionals. It is, of course, true that such professionals owe a duty of care to patients and that they will almost invariably act in what they consider to be the best interests of the patient. But neither habeas corpus nor judicial review are sufficient safeguards against misjudgments and professional lapses in the case of compliant incapacitated patients. Given that such patients are diagnostically indistinguishable from compulsory patients, there is no reason to withhold the specific and effective protections of [the 1983 Act] from a large class of vulnerable mentally incapacitated individuals.

                "50. In March 2000 Mr and Mrs E. complained to the Commissioner about the applicant ’ s readmission to hospital. The complaints subjected to investigation were: (a) that the clinical decision to admit the applicant on 22 July 1997 was unreasonable; and (b) that the clinical management of his admission was inadequate. The independent assessors investigated. In their report, they considered that the applicant ’ s admission to the IBU on 22 July 1997 was “probably unavoidable”. He had a significantly better quality of life with his carers and more serious consideration should have been given to sending him home on the day his carers had been located or, at least, the following day. The assessors considered that it was difficult to see why, even if it was necessary to retain him overnight, he was not discharged the following day and his subsequent evaluation conducted on an outpatient basis. The process of assessment of the applicant had been too long and resources should have been available to speed up that process. In this latter respect, the assessors did not believe that any of the clinicians were acting irresponsibly or maliciously and their main recommendation for the future was that admissions to the IBU be “strictly time-limited” and that adequate resources be made available to enable a multi-disciplinary assessment to be carried out if at all possible on an outpatient basis and, if not, as speedily as possible."

A declaration is, in many ways, a flexible remedy able to meet a variety of situations. In the present conflict, where serious question marks hang over the future care of T. if returned to her mother, there is no practicable alternative to the intervention of the court. The declarations sought by the local authority may require alteration according to the facts found by the judge, but he would have the jurisdiction to vary them to meet the situation after those findings were made.

Further to the publication (in December 2000) of a White Paper on reforming the mental health legislation, a draft Mental Health Bill and a consultation paper were published in June 2002. The objective of the bill, as described in the consultation paper, was twofold: to provide a legal structure for requiring mentally disordered persons to submit to compulsory treatment without necessarily requiring them to be detained in hospital and bringing the law more closely into line with modern human rights law (notably the case - law of the European Convention on Human Rights). Part 5 of the bill (sections 121-39) was entitled “Informal treatment of patients not capable of consenting” and provided for specific safeguards for qualifying patients."

It was proposed that legislation provide for a general authority enabling a person acting reasonably to make decisions on behalf of an incapacitated person and in the incapacitated person ’ s best interests. The general authority would extend to decisions about care and welfare, including medical decisions."

It sets down detailed tests for the assessment of capacity and best interests. The bill creates new mechanisms for the appointment, where appropriate, of a designated decision- maker to act on behalf of an incapacitated patient and to be consulted on any decision made: either a lasting power of attorney (which allows the appointment of someone to act on one ’ s behalf in the case of future loss of capacity) or a court- appointed deputy (who can make decisions on welfare, health care and financial matters as determined by the court). Two new public bodies are also proposed by the bill to support the statutory framework: a new court of protection (for dispute resolution on matters such as capacity and best interests) and a public guardian (a registered authority with supervisory responsibilities as regards the designated decision- makers described above). The bill also provides for the input of an independent consultee ( for a person lacking capacity who has no one who can be consulted about his or her best interests), allows individuals to make an “advance decision” to refuse treatment should they lose capacity in the future and creates a new criminal offence of “ ill-treatment or neglect of a person lacking capacity ”.",

The applicant ’ s complaints under this provision concerned his time in the hospital as an “informal patient” between 22 July and 29 October 1997, which he maintained amounted to a “deprivation of liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. He asserted that that detention was neither “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” nor “lawful” because he was not of unsound mind; the doctrine of necessity did not reflect the criteria for a valid detention under Article 5 § 1 (e) and lacked precision; and there were insufficient safeguards against arbitrary detention on grounds of necessity. He added that he remained of sound mind during his subsequent detention under the 1983 Act ( from 29 October to 12 December 1997 ). The relevant parts of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention provide :",

                "A finding that the present applicant was “detained” would mean that the care of incapacitated but compliant persons elsewhere (even in a private house or nursing home) would be considered detention, a conclusion which would have onerous legal and other implications for such patients and for any person or organisation having responsibility for their care and welfare. In addition, a person already suffering from a socially difficult illness must not unnecessarily suffer the additional stigma of being “sectioned”. Accordingly, just as incapacitated persons requiring medical treatment could be admitted and treated in hospital informally in their best interests, so too should incapacitated persons requiring psychiatric treatment. Moreover, consensual non-imposed treatment was considered more likely to attract a degree of cooperation from the patient and to be therefore more beneficial therapeutically. Furthermore, informal admission and treatment in an incapacitated patient ’ s best interests meant that that person was treated with the required dignity. These considerations explained the provisions of the new draft Mental Health Bill (paragraphs 75-77 above). The Government therefore hoped that the Court ’ s judgment would be consistent with these policy aims and would not require States to apply the full rigour of a statutory regime of involuntary committal to all incapacitated patients requiring psychiatric treatment."

Applying this test, the Government reasoned that, if one took the case of a person who plainly had the capacity to consent to psychiatric treatment, the regime in the hospital was clearly one which did not amount to a deprivation of liberty. The regime applied to the applicant was not materially different and could not be considered to amount to a deprivation of liberty simply because he lacked capacity. In any event, the applicant did not object to being in hospital. While he might have been detained if he had attempted to leave hospital, an intention to detain someone in the future does not amount to detention for the purposes of Article 5. Indeed, since the lucidity of an individual with a psychiatric disorder might vary over time, one could not base a finding of detention merely on a mental state if the underlying regime remained the same. Further, whether the applicant was in the carers ’ home or in the hospital was not, in itself, relevant to the determination of whether there had been a deprivation of liberty, since it was the nature of the restrictions that was relevant. Those restrictions did not amount to involuntary detention but rather to necessary and proper care for someone with the applicant ’ s needs."

As in Nielsen, the hospital remained responsible for the applicant ’ s treatment and, in particular, was obliged to take decisions in his best interests and on his behalf even after his trial discharge to his carers in 1994. H.M. v. Switzerland was, in their view, the most recent expression by the Court of its opinion on the question of whether or not a person could be considered to have been “detained” in circumstances where he or she was unable to express clearly whether or not they wished to be in the relevant institution."

Indeed, this factor needed to be carefully approached in the context of mentally disordered patients incapable of looking after themselves as their care might inevitably include locking doors temporarily as a precaution, in order to prevent them from harming themselves.

The effect on the applicant of his stay in the hospital was a marked deterioration in his well-being. As to the manner of implementation, the applicant maintained (as did Lord Steyn in the House of Lords – see paragraph 4 6 above) that, for a number of reasons detailed by him, the idea that he was free to leave was a “fairy tale”."

He was not medicated and was able to visit and be visited (manner of implementation). H.M. v. Switzerland (cited above) was also distinguishable: in that case, the applicant was in a terrible state before admission and improved thereafter to the extent that she agreed to stay in the institution (effect of the measure). The relevant foster home was an open institution, H.M. had freedom of movement (indeed, her freedom of movement was enhanced by the care in the institution) and she could maintain contact with the outside world (manner of implementation).

The distinction between a deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance ( see Guzzardi v.

Although this Court will have regard to the domestic courts ’ related findings of fact, it does not consider itself bound by their legal conclusions as to whether the applicant was detained or not, not least because the House of Lords considered the question from the point of view of the tort of false imprisonment (see paragraph 39 above) rather than the Convention concept of “deprivation of liberty” in Article 5 § 1, the criteria for assessing those domestic and Convention issues being different.",

The majority of the House of Lords specifically distinguished actual restraint of a person (which would amount to false imprisonment) and restraint which was conditional upon his seeking to leave (which would not constitute false imprisonment). The Court does not consider such a distinction to be of central importance under the Convention. Nor, for the same reason, can the Court accept as determinative the fact relied on by the Government that the regime applied to the applicant (as a compliant incapacitated patient) did not materially differ from that applied to a person who had the capacity to consent to hospital treatment, neither objecting to their admission to hospital. The Court reiterates that the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of Convention protection for the single reason that he may have given himself up to be taken into detention ( see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 36, §§ 64-65), especially when it is not disputed that that person is legally incapable of consenting to, or disagreeing with, the proposed action."

Turning therefore to the concrete situation, as required by Ashingdane, the Court considers the key factor in the present case to be that the health care professionals treating and managing the applicant exercised complete and effective control over his care and movements from 22 July 1997, when he presented acute behavioural problems, to 29 October 1997, when he was compulsorily detained.",
                "More particularly, the applicant had been living with his carers for over three years. On 22 July 1997, following a further incident of violent behaviour and self-harm at his day-care centre, the applicant was sedated before being brought to the hospital and subsequently to the IBU, in the latter case supported by two persons. His responsible medical officer (Dr M. ) indicated clearly that, had the applicant resisted admission or subsequently tried to leave, she would have prevented him from doing so and would have considered his involuntarily committal under section 3 of the 1983 Act ( see paragraphs 12, 13 and 4 1 above). Indeed, as soon as the Court of Appeal indicated that his appeal would be allowed, he was compulsorily detained under the 1983 Act. The correspondence between the applicant ’ s carers and Dr M. ( see paragraphs 23-30 above) reflects both the carers ’ wish to have the applicant immediately released to their care and, equally, the clear intention of Dr M. and the other relevant health care professionals to exercise strict control over his assessment, treatment, contacts and, notably, movement and residence; the applicant would only be released from the hospital to the care of Mr and Mrs E. as and when those professionals considered it appropriate. While the Government suggested that “there was some evidence” that the applicant had not been denied access to his carers, it is clear from the above-noted correspondence that the applicant ’ s contact with his carers was directed and controlled by the hospital, his carers not visiting him after his admission until 2 November 1997",

In this regard, it notes that the applicant in Ashingdane was considered to have been “detained” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e) even during a period when he was in an open ward with regular unescorted access to the unsecured hospital grounds and the possibility of unescorted leave outside the hospital ( pp. 13-14, § 24, and pp. 19-20, § 42 )."

Switzerland ( cited above ), in which it was held that the placing of an elderly applicant in a foster home, to ensure necessary medical care as well as satisfactory living conditions and hygiene, did not amount to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. However, each case has to be decided on its own particular “range of factors” and, while there may be similarities between the present case and H. M. v. Switzerland, there are also distinguishing features. In particular, it was not established that H.M. was legally incapable of expressing a view on her position. She had often stated that she was willing to enter the nursing home and, within weeks of being there, she had agreed to stay. This, combined with a regime entirely different to that applied to the present applicant (the foster home was an open institution which allowed freedom of movement and encouraged contact with the outside world), leads to the conclusion that the facts in H.M. v. Switzerland were not of a “degree” or “intensity” sufficiently serious to justify the finding that she was detained (see Guzzardi, cited above, p. 33, § 93).",

Although the Government noted that the hospital retained responsibility for the present applicant following his release in 1994, the fact that the hospital had to rely on the doctrine of necessity and, subsequently, on the involuntary detention provisions of the 1983 Act demonstrates that the hospital did not have legal authority to act on the applicant ’ s behalf in the same way as Jon Nielsen ’ s mother."

There was no reason why the domestic courts could not have reviewed whether the facts of the case justified detention, a review which could have included an examination of whether what was done in the interests of the applicant had been reasonably done.

Since there was no domestic court examination of whether he was of unsound mind within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (e) and Winterwerp v. the Netherlands ( judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33), the State could not discharge its burden of proof and establish that there was a legal basis for his detention.",

The Court reiterates that an individual cannot be deprived of his liberty on the basis of unsoundness of mind unless three minimum conditions are satisfied: he must reliably be shown to be of unsound mind; the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; and the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 17-18, § 39; Luberti v.

In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant has not suggested that the relevant health care professionals acted other than in good faith, responsibly and in what they considered to be his best interests. He had had a long history of serious behavioural problems and special care requirements, and had been treated in the hospital for over thirty years following which he was discharged in 1994 on a trial basis only. There is evidence of increasingly difficult behavioural problems before July 1997 ( see paragraphs 13, 14 and 39 above). It was not disputed that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder on 22 July 1997, that he was agitated, self-harming and controllable with sedation only while in the day-care centre or that he had given rise to an emergency situation on that day. Having regard to the detailed consideration of the matter by Dr M. (who had cared for the applicant since 1977) and by the other health care professionals on that day (see paragraphs 1 2, 13 and 39 above) together with the day-care centre ’ s report ( see paragraph 14), the Court considers that there is adequate evidence justifying the initial decision to detain the applicant on 22 July 1997.",
                "Thereafter, Dr M. ’ s correspondence with Mr and Mrs E. is demonstrative of a detailed assessment of the applicant and the consistent clinical view, maintained throughout the relevant period, of Dr M. and other health care professionals involved that the applicant required admission for such assessment and treatment. Dr G. was briefed by the applicant ’ s carers and he expressed the same view in his report of August 1997. On the basis of the material before them, the judges of the House of Lords were unanimous in finding his detention to be justified on the grounds of necessity in his best interests. Lord Goff relied on the above -mentioned affidavit of Dr M. in which she opined that the applicant required admission for assessment and treatment and would have been considered for involuntary committal under the 1983 Act if he had tried to leave ( see paragraphs 39 -4 1 above). As noted above, once the possibility of his leaving arose in October 1997, the formal procedures for his committal were put in place (section 5(2) of the 1983 Act) followed by a committal under section 3 of that Act, which latter procedure required two medical certificates attesting to the necessity of his committal for treatment for a mental disorder ( see paragraph 54 above). Finally, the fact that he was, in the report dated 27 November 1997, found to be suffering from a mental impairment which no longer warranted confinement clearly does not undermine the validity of the prior assessments to the contrary. Indeed, following this first independent clinical indication that detention was no longer warranted, the applicant was released."

It had also been accepted that unwritten law, so long as it was sufficiently precise, could satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Indeed, the Government observed that the common law had the benefit of flexibility and evolution, so the fact that the Court of Appeal applied the doctrine of necessity in a particular way after the applicant ’ s detention did not mean that it would not have done so earlier if requested. It would be wrong therefore to characterise the doctrine of necessity (and notions of best interests, necessity and reasonableness) as too uncertain for the purposes of the lawfulness requirement of Article 5 § 1, not least because similar notions are used in many States ’ systems and in the Convention system itself."

(Mental Patient: Sterilisation), cited above ) and by its subsequent application prior to and in the present case. In particular, the doctrine of necessity required the establishment of: a lack of capacity; the best interests of the patient (such interests being long-recognised as including considerations wider than the strictly medical, such as ethical, social, moral and welfare needs – see Re F. (Adult: Court ’ s Jurisdiction), cited above, and the practice note and direction of May 2001, paragraphs 59-61 and 73-74 above); and that the proposed action was an objectively reasonable step to take.

In addition, there was no need for a definition of “compliant”, as suggested by the applicant, as it was a word of ordinary usage.

This test came under much criticism from, among others, the Law Commission, which led to a consultation paper which was, in turn, adopted by the government in large part in its Green Paper “Making decisions” in October 1999. The proposals therein were not put into effect in legislation and the test was not expanded until R. -B. (A Patient) v. Official Solicitor, sub nom Re A. (Male Patient: Sterilisation ) ( cited above ), when the Court of Appeal ruled that the concept of best interests required compliance with two duties: not to act negligently (to act in accordance with a practice accepted at the time by a reasonable body of medical opinion skilled in the particular form of treatment in question – the “ Bolam ” test), and a separate duty to act in the individual ’ s best interests.

Further, given the importance of personal liberty, the relevant national law must meet the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the citizen – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action might entail ( see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-B, pp. 41-42, §§ 35- 36; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998- VII, p. 2735, § 54; and Kawka v.

Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 170, ECHR 2004 ‑ II ). This objective, and the broader condition that detention be “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, require the existence in domestic law of adequate legal protections and “fair and proper procedures” ( see Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 19-20, § 45, and Amuur v.

The Court considers it clear that the domestic legal basis for the applicant ’ s detention between 22 July and 29 October 1997 was the common - law doctrine of necessity: the House of Lords may have differed on whether his admission and stay in hospital amounted to detention, but it was unanimous in finding that he had been admitted to hospital pursuant to that doctrine. In addition, the Court considers that, when the doctrine of necessity was applied in the area of mental health, it accommodated the minimum conditions for the lawful detention of those of unsound mind outlined in paragraph 98 above."

                "117. In this connection, the Court has noted that as early as 1772 the common law permitted detention of those who were a potential danger to themselves in so far as this was shown to be necessary. In the early 1990s necessity was the recognised legal basis for the consideration of authorisations for certain medical treatment (sterilisation and artificial nutrition and hydration) of incapacitated individuals ( see paragraph 57 above). Re S. (Hospital Patient: Court ’ s Jurisdiction) and Re S. (Hospital Patient: Foreign Curator) together with Re C. (Mental Patient: Contact), reported in 1993 and 1996, resulted in declarations being made as to the best interests of incapacitated individuals pursuant to the doctrine of necessity where there was a conflict over certain welfare issues (see, in particular, the judgment of Lady Justice Butler-Sloss in Re F. (Adult: Court ’ s Jurisdiction ), paragraphs 59 -61 above).",
                "In addition, all the judges of the House of Lords in the present case relied on Re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) in unanimously concluding that the admission and treatment of an incapacitated compliant patient could be justified on the basis of the doctrine of necessity. Lord Goff, delivering the main judgment, had “no doubt” about this conclusion. Moreover, all counsel before the House of Lords were in agreement as to the precise elements of the doctrine of necessity to be applied (Lord Steyn, paragraph 47 above). These were “simply ” that : ( i ) there must be a necessity to act when it is not practicable to communicate with the assisted person, and (ii) that the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all circumstances take, acting in the best interests of the assisted person. Furthermore, as is clear from the statistics provided by the Mental Health Act Commission to the House of Lords, the applicant was one of thousands of compliant incapacitated patients detained each year on the basis of the doctrine of necessity. Finally, the Court does not consider that the lack of a definition of “compliant ” rendered the applicant ’ s detention unforeseeable: the majority of the House of Lords expressed no particular difficulty in applying the notion of compliance in the present case."

Broader welfare matters were also introduced in the “best interests” assessment ( see Re F. (Adult: Court ’ s Jurisdiction) and R. ‑ B. (A Patient) v. Official Solicitor, sub nom Re A. (Male Sterilisation) – paragraphs 59-62 above). It is therefore true that each element of the doctrine might not have been fully defined in 1997. This is reflected in, for example, the conflict between the views of Lady Justice Butler-Sloss in R. ‑ B.

Nor is there any specific provision requiring a continuing clinical assessment of the persistence of a disorder warranting detention. The appointment of a representative of a patient who could make certain objections and applications on his or her behalf is a procedural protection accorded to those committed involuntarily under the 1983 Act and which would be of equal importance for patients who are legally incapacitated and have, as in the present case, extremely limited communication abilities."

While the Court does not question the good faith of those professionals or that they acted in what they considered to be the applicant ’ s best interests, the very purpose of procedural safeguards is to protect individuals against any “misjudgments and professional lapses” (Lord Steyn, paragraph 49 above)."

On the other hand, it has also noted the Government ’ s understandable concern (outlined in paragraph 80 above) to avoid the full, formal and inflexible impact of the 1983 Act.

More importantly, the courts would rarely in judicial review interfere with primary findings of fact made by a public authority, particularly where that authority had a particular expertise. Even the more intense review (the “super-Wednesbury ” test ) did not amount to an examination as to whether the authority was correct in acting as it did, but rather whether it had acted “unreasonably” or “irrationally” ( see Smith and Grady, cited above, §§ 137-38 ).

The Court considers that the starting - point must be X v. the United Kingdom ( cited above, pp. 22-26, §§ 52-59), where the Court found that the review conducted in habeas corpus proceedings was insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 § 4 as not being wide enough to bear on those conditions which were essential for the “lawful” detention of a person on the basis of unsoundness of mind since it did not allow a determination of the merits of the question as to whether the mental disorder persisted. The Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that X v. the United Kingdom can be distinguished because it concerned detention pursuant to a statutory power : no authority has been cited and no other material adduced to indicate that the courts ’ review of detention based on the common - law doctrine of necessity would indeed have been more intrusive."

Nor does the Court find convincing the Government ’ s reliance on the development of the “super-Wednesbury” principles of judicial review prior to the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000. Those principles were outlined and applied in the domestic judgment in Reg. v. the Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith (cited above). In the subsequent application to this Court by the same applicant, it was found that, even if his essential complaints under Article 8 of the Convention had been considered by the domestic courts, the threshold at which those courts could have found to be irrational the impugned policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces had been placed so high that it effectively ruled out any consideration by the domestic courts of the question whether the interference with the applicant ’ s rights answered a pressing social need or was proportionate to the national security and public - order aims pursued, principles which lay at the heart of the Court ’ s analysis of complaints under Article 8. The Court concluded that the remedy of judicial review, even on a “super-Wednesbury” basis, could not therefore constitute an effective remedy (within the meaning of Article 13) for a breach of Mr Smith ’ s rights under Article 8 ( see Smith and Grady, cited above, §§ 35 and 129 - 39)."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, § 69, ECHR 1999 ‑ II ) that, even with the application of the “super-Wednesbury” principles on judicial review, the bar of unreasonableness would, at the time of the applicant ’ s domestic proceedings, have been placed so high as effectively to exclude any adequate examination of the merits of the clinical views as to the persistence of mental illness justifying detention. This is indeed confirmed by the decision of the Court of Appeal, in a case where the necessity of medical treatment was contested by the patient ( see R. (Wilkinson) v. the Responsible Medical Officer Broadmoor Hospital, cited in paragraph 63 above), that pre-incorporation judicial review of necessity in accordance with the “ super-Wednesbury” criteria was not sufficiently intrusive to constitute an adequate examination of the merits of the relevant medical decisions."

It is not necessary therefore to examine the applicant ’ s additional submissions that those proceedings did not satisfy the requirements of that Article because, inter alia, the burden of proof was on the detainee or because such proceedings did not provide “speedy” and “periodic control” at “reasonable intervals”."

The Government then proposed, without further detail, that the applicant could have relied on the declaratory jurisdiction of the High Court."

                "315. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that under the Convention system prior to 1 November 1998 the establishment and verification of facts was primarily a matter for the Commission (former Articles 28 § 1 and 31 of the Convention). In the instant case, however, although a delegation of the Commission heard evidence in Cyprus (see paragraph 10 above), the Commission did not adopt a report under former Article 31 by 1 November 1999 (see paragraph 7 above). The Court is therefore required, in accordance with Article 5 § 3 in fine of Protocol No. 11 and Rule 99 § 5 of the Rules of Court, to assess the evidence and establish the facts in the light of all the material before it. The following general considerations are relevant in this context.",
                "(i) The Court has based its findings on the evidence given orally before the Commission delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings; in the assessment of whether or not the applicants’ allegations are well-founded, the standard of proof is that of “beyond reasonable doubt”. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact; in addition, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161).",
                "(ii) In relation to the oral evidence, the Court is aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters: it has therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before the Commission delegates. In relation to both the written and the oral evidence, the Court is aware that the cultural context in which some of the applicants and witnesses live has rendered inevitable a certain imprecision with regard to dates and other details (in particular, numerical matters), and it does not consider that this by itself affects the credibility of the testimonies.",
                "(iii) In a case where there are contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Court is acutely aware of its own shortcomings as a first-instance tribunal of fact. The problems of language are adverted to above; there is also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region. In addition, neither the Commission nor the Court had powers of compulsion as regards the attendance of witnesses. In the present case, while twenty-eight witnesses were summoned to appear, five of them failed to give evidence before the Commission delegates. The Court has therefore been faced with the difficult task of determining events in the absence of potentially significant testimony.",
                "(iv) The Court has not been provided with the case file of any detailed investigation at the domestic level as regards the alleged expulsion of the applicants between 4 and 22 April 1994. The Court has accordingly based its findings on the evidence given orally before the Commission delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings."

In particular, the Court notes that, despite their written testimonies made before the Cypriot authorities denying the allegations, the applicants confirmed their original allegations before the Commission delegates, describing the events in detail and with very few discrepancies. The Court does not find these discrepancies irreconcilable, the small differences being due to difficulties of memory after a long lapse of time.",

The Court attaches in the first place particular importance to the undisputed arrival, in the night of 17 April 1994, or at latest around 4 o’clock in the morning of 18 April 1994, of Hüseyin Mavideniz, his wife and children, of Hüseyin Davulcular and his wife, and of Doğan Davulcular, his wife and children, at the homes of Aziz Merthoca and Yılmaz Davulcular, in the south. It notes that they came for the purpose of finding jobs and to live there. Panayiota Papachristophorou alleged that on 17 April 1994 she had given Aziz money for a taxi to go to the northern part of the island and pick up a number of Turkish Cypriots, but that on the same day, late in the evening, she was displeased to see Aziz bring so many people to her house. She alleged that Aziz had brought all the Turkish Cypriots to her house, that is, Hüseyin Mavideniz, his wife and their children, Doğan Davulcular, his wife and their children, and Hüseyin Davulcular, his wife and their children. As a consequence, on 18 April 1994, as early as 8 a.m., she allegedly gave them money for a taxi to return to the north. The Court considers that this version lacks credibility and discloses a desire to establish her sole responsibility for the return of those people to the northern part of the island on the same day.",
                "The Court finds it difficult to accept that, after travelling for many hours to come and settle in the south, a group of people including women and children would choose to give up their plans immediately and to travel back on a long and tiring journey for the sole reason that Aziz Merthoca’s wife did not want them to stay at her house. On the other hand, no other explanation has been provided by the Government as to why those who stayed at the house of Yılmaz Mavideniz should have decided to go back to the north early in the morning on the day after their arrival.",
                "In assessing the evidence, the Court also attaches significance to the fact that, as transpires from the statements made by the CIS officers and most of the applicants before the delegates, it was a common practice among Turkish Cypriots arriving from the north for the purpose of settling in the south to go to the police and ask for social assistance in matters such as accommodation or jobs."

The Government denied until the hearing of witnesses in Nicosia that the applicants had been arrested on the dates in question or that they went to any police station for the purpose of making statements to the effect that they were leaving. However, on 3 September 1998, Andreas Spatalos submitted six statements to the Commission delegates (see paragraph 285 above) and claimed that, on various dates, six Turkish Cypriots went to the police stations in Limassol (İlker Denizci, Erbay Kaptanoğlu, Yılmaz Mavideniz and Süleyman Seyer) and Paphos (İlker Tufansoy and Taşer Kişmir) and signed these statements, as they wanted to go to the northern part of the island. His assertion that the statements were filled in by various police officers in Paphos and in Limassol is, however, contradicted by the examination of the statements, which shows that the handwriting in the forms is the same on all of them. Taking also into account that the CIS officers heard by the Commission confirmed that each CIS officer was attached to a particular police station, the oral testimony of the applicants to the effect that they signed the statements at the same police station, namely that of the Troodos/Kambos area, is therefore entirely credible."

Serious doubts arise, however, as to the credibility of these statements, having regard in particular to the following elements.",
                "(i) The Court gives special weight to Taşer Kişmir’s testimony before the Commission delegates. The Government challenged the credibility of his statements to the Commission and of those made in the northern part of the island, as well as his oral testimony. They stressed that the applicant’s brother lived in the north and suggested that, therefore, the applicant feared for his brother and was afraid to say that he had been obliged to lie in his application to the Commission.",
                "The Court notes that, after having denied twice before the Cypriot police the account of the events presented in his application to the Commission, the applicant came before the delegates despite his bad condition (following an accident at work, he was in a wheelchair) and his visible physical suffering. He confirmed before the delegates his original complaint and alleged that he had made four statements to the Cypriot police, all of them untruthful, which had been dictated by the police.",
                "(ii) The Court was also impressed with Erbay Kaptanoğlu’s oral statement before the Commission and found it to be consistent with other evidence before it. The Court was therefore satisfied that the applicant provided a truthful, and, in its essential details, accurate account of the events.",
                "(iii) In his statement to the Cypriot police, İlker Tufansoy declared that he had decided to cross secretly to the north of the island because his mother was ill. However, in her oral testimony, Rebiye Tufansoy denied that she was ill at the material time. The Court has no reasons to doubt the sincerity of Rebiye Tufansoy’s statement to the Commission delegates. She is an illiterate elderly woman, who was obviously unable to invent a story and provide false answers in a consistent way.",
                "Dimitra Irodotou’s statement before the delegates reinforced the doubts raised by İlker Tufansoy’s statement to the Cypriot police. Her statement confirmed that İlker Tufansoy was arrested and expelled together with Taşer Kişmir. The Court also notes that she explained that, upon his return to the south, İlker went to the police to explain that he wanted to live with her, so that the police would not send him back to the north. The police treated him well, so İlker made a statement.",
                "(iv) In the statement he made on 23 August 1994 to the Cypriot police, Murat Doksandokuz declared that he had decided to go to the northern part because he started to be afraid following the murder of Theophilos Georghiades. However, in his oral evidence, he alleged that he went to the northern part to see his mother who was ill. The Court also notes other striking inconsistencies in Murat Doksandokuz’s statements. In particular, in his statement to the Cypriot police, he alleged that it was Erbay Kaptanoğlu who had spoken on his behalf, but not with his consent, to the journalists gathered at Nicosia Hospital in northern Cyprus. The witness did not mention this at all before the delegates, adding that he could not remember which version of the facts he had presented to the United Nations investigators. The Court also finds particularly obscure the description of his arrest by the “TRNC” police, who allegedly took him to the airport together with about one hundred persons, among whom was also Erbay Kaptanoğlu (see paragraph 250 above). This description was confirmed neither by his own statement to the Cypriot police nor by any other witness."

After their arrest, they were taken to the police station in Limassol and then to what they believed were the CIS headquarters in Nicosia, with the exception of Taşer Kişmir and İlker Tufansoy, who were taken directly to Nicosia. The applicants were mostly arrested by CIS officers whom they knew. After being kept in Nicosia for a while, towards noon they were taken to a police station in a mountain area, presumably that of Troodos/Kambos, although the applicants’ oral testimony does not allow the Court to identify precisely the village in which the police station was located. The applicants were kept in that police station for the whole afternoon. In the evening, between 8 and 9 p.m., the applicants were taken to a dry riverbed and expelled to the north under threat that if they came back they would be killed. Then they crossed the buffer-zone and reached the northern part of the island in the Angolemi/Taşpınar area, where they were apprehended by Turkish soldiers who handed them over to the “TRNC” police. Because they were wounded, the “TRNC” police took them to hospital and then detained them on remand. The applicants appear to have been taken, although not by force, to be examined by United Nations doctors. They were also interviewed by the United Nations civilian police.",

Moreover, it has not been alleged that all these injuries were of an accidental nature or that they were caused by the applicants themselves. The Court must therefore determine which of the injuries were sustained by the applicants at the relevant period. In doing so, the Court will rely mainly on the findings of the United Nations doctors, but also, to a lesser degree having regard to the superficial nature of the evidence, on the medical examination of some of the applicants in the northern part of Cyprus.

In particular, the Court observes that, in his reports, Dr Matsakis made a number of comments which were not of a medical nature, but covered issues outside his competence. In this respect, the Court notes that, throughout his 1994 and 1995 reports, Dr Matsakis expressed the view that the applicants had fled to the northern part of Cyprus. Moreover, in his oral statement before the Commission, Dr Matsakis admitted that his comments on Yılmaz Mavideniz’s intelligence and social status (see paragraphs 165 and 266 above) were subjective and probably exaggerated.",

From Dimitra Irodotou’s statement (see paragraph 281 above) about her visit, with İlker Tufansoy, to the police in order to inform them that they wanted to live together, it appears that İlker Tufansoy needed the permission of the police to live in the Republic of Cyprus.",

From the evidence gathered by the authorities and from the evidence before the Commission delegates, the Court finds the following established. After his expulsion on 22 April 1994, İlker Tufansoy returned to the south on 5 May 1994 and stayed at a house in Paphos indicated by the Cypriot police. On the morning of 2 June 1994, İlker Tufansoy told the police that he intended to live in Stavrokonno. In the afternoon of 2 June 1994, he talked to the muhtar of Stavrokonno, who told him he could have the empty house of which Ertuğrul Akburç had spoken. In the evening of 2 June 1994, İlker Tufansoy, his friend Ertuğrul Akburç and Kyriakos Nikolau went to clean the house in which İlker intended to live together with Dimitra Irodotou. After they had cleaned the house, at about 9 p.m., as they were going back to Ertuğrul Akburç’s house, İlker Tufansoy and Ertuğrul Akburç were shot and killed by unidentified men using automatic rifles and shotguns."

The Government stressed that these remedies were effective and submitted a non-exhaustive list of criminal cases filed by the police following complaints made by Turkish Cypriots which proved, in the Government’s view, that where the Cypriot authorities had the cooperation and assistance of Turkish Cypriots the latter had effective access to the criminal courts in Cyprus. In this respect, the Government rebutted the allegations that the Attorney-General had failed to conduct an investigation, but submitted that, due to the applicants’ refusal to cooperate, any inquiry by the Attorney-General’s Office with a view to the prosecution of suspects would have been fruitless. The Government also submitted examples of cases filed in the civil courts by various Turkish Cypriots against Greek-Cypriot defendants to prove that Turkish Cypriots had access to the civil courts in Cyprus."

Despite this information, the Attorney-General of the Republic of Cyprus at no time inquired into any of these allegations, although he had and still has the power to conduct such an inquiry ex officio (see paragraph 312 above).

Having regard to the Attorney-General’s refusal to take any action, the Court decided that the applicant’s complaint to the Ombudsman had not discharged the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus of the duty to “undertake an investigation capable of leading to the punishment (as opposed to the mere identification) of those responsible” (see Egmez, § 67).",

None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant ’ s requests and appeals.

He submitted, inter alia, that the Burgomaster had failed to take into account the fact that he was residing in the Ganzenhoef area, that he needed to be present there in person twice a week in order to collect his social security benefits and that he received social counselling there.

According to the applicant, the legislature had never intended structural nuisance caused by drug abusers to be considered as creating an emergency situation. Moreover, the applicant’s absence from the Ganzenhoef area would not make any difference in this respect since he was only one of many drug abusers in that area. The applicant also complained that the order was contrary to Article 6 of the Convention in that it constituted a sanction and could therefore only be imposed by a judge.

During this hearing the representative of the Burgomaster stated that already on 19 April 1994 a prohibition order for fourteen days had been imposed on the applicant and that on 16 November 1994 the applicant had not wished to make any statement to the police as to the reasons for his presence in the Ganzenhoef area. Despite the previous orders, the applicant had continued his undesirable conduct and on this ground the imposition of a new prohibition order had been sought. The Burgomaster’s representative further stated that the address where the applicant had stated that he resided and where he collected his mail and social security benefits was in fact the address of the Streetcornerwork Foundation. It was not possible to reside at that address. This Foundation had a procedure under which social-security benefits for persons subject to a prohibition order could be collected by an authorised third party and it was possible for the applicant to avail himself of that procedure."

It considered, inter alia, having regard to the fact that the applicant had, within a short period of time, regularly committed acts which had disrupted public order and that the prohibition orders for eight hours which had been issued had not prevented him from behaving in that manner, that the imposition of the prohibition order had not been unreasonable. It further found that the order was in conformity with Section 172 (3) of the Municipality Act, that therefore it was not necessary to examine the question whether or not the conditions set out in Section 175 of the Municipality Act had been fulfilled, and that the Burgomaster had not exceeded his competence under the Municipality Act. It did not agree with the applicant that the impugned measure constituted a penalty as it had been issued in order to maintain public order. The committee finally found that the interference with the applicant’s right to liberty of movement had been justified and that the prohibition order could not be regarded as disproportionate."

The Regional Court accepted that the overt use of hard drugs in public places and the presence of a concentration of drug abusers and dealers disrupted public order and acknowledged the necessity to end such nuisance, in particular when this occurred continuously at specific locations in the city. The Regional Court noted that the Burgomaster availed himself of two means to that end, namely prohibition orders of either eight hours or fourteen days. It considered the procedure established as regards the imposition of prohibition orders for a duration of fourteen days and noted that this procedure had not been fully complied with in that the applicant’s prohibition order had not been sought by the competent police officer. However, as it was not established that this had harmed the applicant’s interests, it did not find that this flaw should result in the quashing of the order. It did, however, find that the order should be quashed on other grounds."

The Regional Court held that, unlike the situation in which an eight ‑ hour prohibition order has been imposed, Section 172 (3) of the Municipality Act offered no basis for the imposition of a prohibition order for a duration of fourteen days. It held on this point that the competence established by this provision aimed to create a possibility for direct reaction to an expected disturbance of public order and might serve to prohibit someone’s presence for a limited period of time in the area where the disturbance of public order was expected. It held that the eight-hour prohibition order was such as to meet this need, but not the fourteen days prohibition order, the latter measure being disproportionate in relation to the expected disruption of public order and thus going beyond what could be considered necessary for maintaining public order."

                "21. The Regional Court added that in the present case this was all the more so as the applicant had no permanent place of residence and used the address of the Streetcornerwork Foundation as his postal address. The prohibition order implied that the applicant’s freedom of movement was limited for fourteen days in a manner which prevented him from collecting his mail and from receiving his social security benefits. It rejected the argument advanced by the Burgomaster’s representative that the police would not undertake any formal action against the applicant for acting contrary to Article 184 of the Criminal Code ( Wetboek van Strafrecht ), i.e. the offence of failure to comply with an official order ( ambtelijk bevel ), when collecting his social security benefits at the address of the Streetcornerwork Foundation, considering that the applicant’s freedom of movement could not be made dependent on the willingness of the police officer on duty to tolerate intrinsically punishable conduct."

The Regional Court further found that the situation at issue, i.e. nuisance caused by drug abuse, did not constitute a situation within the meaning of Section 175 of the Municipality Act and accordingly held that the Burgomaster could not have based the prohibition order on this provision. As it had already found the prohibition order to be incompatible with national law, the Regional Court did not find it necessary to determine whether or not the order was compatible with Article 6 of the Convention.",

In its judgment of 19 December 1996, following adversarial proceedings, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division quashed the Regional Court’s judgment of 19 January 1996 and rejected the applicant’s appeal to the Regional Court as ill-founded. Its reasoning included the following:",
                "“The prohibition order issued against Landvreugd is based on a decision of the appellant, dated 28 October 1993 and addressed to the Chief Superintendent of Police, which contains an instruction to the police relating to the preparation and issuing of a fourteen-day prohibition order. This instruction designates the Ganzenhoef area as an “emergency area” and indicates the behaviour which the appellant considers to be constitutive of serious breaches of public order, including the overt possession or use on or near the public highway of addictive substances within the meaning of Section 2 of the Opium Act.",
                "The Regional Court held, among other things, that the appellant was not competent to act on the basis of Section 175 of the Municipality Act, because a situation within the meaning of that Section was lacking. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division does not share this opinion. Its reasons are the following.",
                "It is laid down in Section 175, first paragraph, of the Municipality Act that in case of a riotous movement, of other serious disorders or of calamities, as well as in case of a well-founded fear of the development thereof, the Burgomaster is empowered to issue all orders which he deems necessary for the maintenance of public order or the limitation of general danger. In doing so he may deviate from rules other than those of the Constitution.",
                "The Administrative Jurisdiction Division notes at the outset that giving orders in the situations described in Section 175 of the Municipality Act is not contrary to the right to freedom of movement as guaranteed by Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, since provision has been made for the possibility to limit this right by law – which also includes an order given by the Burgomaster pursuant to the law – for the protection of public order.",
                "Section 175 of the Municipality Act replaced Section 219 of the Municipality Act which was repealed as of 1 January 1994. As did Section 219, Section 175 grants the Burgomaster emergency powers which should only be used in exceptional situations. Thus provision has been made by law for circumstances in which ordinary means are insufficient to restore and maintain public order. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division notes in this connection that the wording of Section 175 does not lead to the conclusion that that provision, as compared with Section 219, is intended to introduce any changes as regards the circumstances in which emergency powers may be used. Its drafting history does not justify holding otherwise.",
                "In the opinion of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, ordinary means may be considered insufficient in the present case and there was, at the time of the decision on the objection, an exceptional situation of the kind referred to above. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division finds in this regard that the facts relating to the situation in the Ganzenhoef area, based on which the appellant decided to issue the fourteen-day prohibition order, are established. In light of the decision of 28 October 1993 the situation there was characterised by the presence of a large number of drug addicts and the attendant nuisance, inconvenience, insecurity and threats to other citizens. This factual situation is so serious that the personnel and means available to the appellant were insufficient to counter the disruptions of public order thereby caused.",
                "It is important to note in this context that at the time the objection was decided on, it was not possible to solve the problem there by means of a regulation adopted by the municipality ( gemeentelijke regeling ). At that time there was no relevant provision in any municipality bye-law, nor were any other adequate administrative-law means available. Given that the decision dismissing the objection was given before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division delivered its decision of 14 May 1996 ..., the absence of such a provision cannot be held against the appellant. Apart from that, by a decision of 26 June 1996, Section 2.6 A has been added to the General Municipal Bye-law of Amsterdam, which contains a regulation governing prohibition orders in relation to hard drugs. Against this background, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division is of the opinion that it cannot be maintained that the appellant was not entitled to use the powers granted him by Section 175 of the Municipality Act.",
                "Moreover, nothing brought forward by Landvreugd constitutes a ground to find that the appellant could not reasonably decide, in the light of the circumstances of the case, to issue a fourteen-day prohibition order.",
                "... The position taken by the appellant, that the risk of repetition of behaviour constituting a breach of the peace was so great that a fourteen-day prohibition order was necessary, is not unreasonable.",

It held, however, that the mere fact that two and a half years had passed since the Burgomaster had declared an emergency situation – the case related to the Burgomaster’s instruction of 17 October 1989 – was not sufficient per se to justify the conclusion that an exceptional situation no longer existed. It also held, in the same judgment, that Article 6 of the Convention did not apply to eight-hour prohibition orders because such orders were not given by way of penal sanction but were in the nature of a measure aimed at preserving public order. Nor did such orders violate Article 2 of the Fourth Protocol, since they were “in accordance with law” and “necessary in a democratic society” for “the maintenance of ordre public ”.

In fact, the length of time that had passed since the Burgomaster had first designated a part of Amsterdam as an “emergency area”, the number of additional areas so designated since then and the continued existence of an “emergency” proved that such designations were ineffective; the impugned measures could therefore not be considered “necessary in a democratic society”.

However, if the applicant did not wait in the queue for his turn and left of his own will, then the failure to produce documents could not be held against him. Alternatively, if the police asked for his documents, that suggests, by converse implication, that it was his turn in the queue or else that he was granted priority treatment. Furthermore, the City Court established that the applicant had shown his advocate's card but failed to explain the relevance of its finding that the card had been issued in Grozny rather than in Nalchik ( a finding which is, moreover, refuted by a copy of the card produced by the applicant in evidence ). The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kabardino-Balkaria of 21 September 1999 did nothing to eliminate these discrepancies."

Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A, p. 19, § 39) or, where the restriction applies to particular areas only, be “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4."

The inquiries carried out by the prosecutor's office and by the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior established that the restriction in issue had been imposed by an oral order given by the Deputy Head of the Public Safety Police of the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior, Colonel Efendiyev. It appears that the order was not properly formalised or recorded in some other traceable way, enabling the Court to carry out an assessment of its contents, scope and legal basis. Indeed, the reference to section 11 ( 22 ) of the Police Act appeared for the first time in the Government's submissions in the proceedings before the Court. In any event, in the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the order amounted to a violation of the constitutional right to liberty of movement enshrined in Article 27 of the Russian Constitution."

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been relied on both on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 as well, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 89, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 26, § 67 )."

As, in the Government's submission, a person's ethnic origin is not listed anywhere in Russian identity documents, the order barred the passage not only of any person who actually was of Chechen ethnicity, but also of those who were merely perceived as belonging to that ethnic group. It has not been claimed that representatives of other ethnic groups were subject to similar restrictions ( see, in particular, paragraph 51 above).

A differential treatment of persons in relevantly similar situations, without an objective and reasonable justification, constitutes discrimination (see Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, § 48, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV). Discrimination on account of one's actual or perceived ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination (see the definitions adopted by the United Nations and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance – paragraphs 33 and 34 above). Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145)."

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, p. 20, § 72). The “dispute” must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise.

Accordingly, the Court considers that the judgment at issue was essentially of a declaratory nature and did not concern any “dispute” over a civil right. Nor did the judgment determine the scope or manner of exercise of the applicant's right to a loan because he had not raised these issues in the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to conclude that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied to the proceedings which ended with the judgment of 19 November 1997 or to the ensuing enforcement stage which is regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Kanayev v.

Furthermore, there is nothing in the law of 22 August 2004 to render null and void all the judgments adopted earlier under the previous legislation. If such was the meaning of the Law of 22 August 2004, it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty, enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and would constitute a disproportionate interference with the possessions of those who obtained judicial awards against the State, and thus would be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Russia, no. 75470/01, § 26, 13 April 2006 ), even if such changes are to the disadvantage of certain welfare recipients.

The Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law, which reflects a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. Article 6 § 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their judgments, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 199 4, § 29, Series A no. 303-A). Even though a domestic court has a certain margin of appreciation when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of the parties ’ submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, § 36, 1 July 2003 ). A further function of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that they have been heard. Moreover, a reasoned decision affords a party the possibility to appeal against it, as well as the possibility of having the decision reviewed by an appellate body. It is only by giving a reasoned decision that there can be public scrutiny of the administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirvisaari v. Finland, no. 49684/99, § 30, 27 September 2001)."

Secondly, they found that the applicant ’ s residence might have been unlawful because “a treaty” between Russia and Georgia on visa-based exchanges required her to be in possession of an entry visa."

A representative of the flat owner confirmed that consent in the oral submissions before the District Court. The District Court subsequently directed that the reference to those submissions be added to the hearing record (see paragraph 17 above). It follows that the flat owner ’ s consent was validly produced in the domestic proceedings and its existence was acknowledged by the District Court, which gave no reasons whatsoever for its finding that there existed a dispute between the applicant and the flat owner. Nor did the District Court indicate any reasons for holding that the municipal-tenancy provisions of the Housing and Civil Codes applied in a situation where the flat owner had clear title to the flat and wished to make it available to the applicant."

As to the domestic courts ’ reliance on “a treaty” between Russia and Georgia on visa requirements, the Court observes that they omitted to verify whether such a treaty was in existence. In fact, the visa requirement for Georgian citizens had not been introduced by a treaty as the District Court maintained, but had resulted from the denunciation by Russia of the Bishkek Agreement in the absence of a separate treaty on visa-free movement between Russia and Georgia (see paragraph 28 above). The Court is not convinced that this discrepancy could have been the result of a mere difference in terms because the text of the “treaty on visa-based exchanges” was never produced in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts appear to have taken the reference to it from the passport department ’ s submissions. Furthermore, the Court finds it anomalous that the District Court relied on a treaty governing the conditions of entry and stay for Georgian citizens without giving any reasons for the assumption that the applicant was a Georgian citizen. As the Court has found above, no evidence to that effect has been produced either in the domestic proceedings or before it."

As the applicant ’ s statement of appeal indicated that the District Court ’ s findings had been devoid of a factual and/or legal basis, it was all the more important that the City Court give proper reasons of its own (see Hirvisaari, cited above, § 32).

                "49. The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure in issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning “ State secrets ”. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration, and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of “ State secrets ” became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that “the test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ” (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph 30 above )."

            [
                "38. The Court has next to determine whether the interference complained of was justified. It reiterates that Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4, which guarantees the right to leave any country, including one ’ s own, must be read subject to the third paragraph of that Article, which provides for certain restrictions that may be placed on the exercise of that right in the interests of, inter alia, national security or public safety. The Convention organs have previously accepted that restrictions imposed following a failure to comply with military service obligations (see Marangos v. Cyprus, no. 31106/96, Commission decision of 20 May 1997, unreported ), or restrictions on the travel of a mentally ill person who had no arrangements for appropriate care in the destination country (see Nordblad v. Sweden, no. 19076/91, Commission decision of 13 October 1993, unreported ), were permissible. The Court has dealt with the withdrawal of travel documents and passports in applications concerning criminal (or bankruptcy) proceedings against applicants or third parties (see, for example, Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). So far there has been no application to the Convention institutions where a person was denied the right to travel abroad on the sole ground of his or her knowledge of certain “State secrets”. The applicable test is nonetheless similar: in order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 such a restriction must be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281-A, and Napijalo, cited above, § 74 ).",

                "39. The applicant contended that the restriction that had been imposed was not in accordance with the law because he had never signed a contract of employment containing a restriction on his right to leave the Russian Federation. The undertaking he had signed in 1994 did not contain any such restriction."

                "40. The Government indicated that in 1977, 1989 and 1994 the applicant had signed undertakings not to disclose State secrets. The undertaking of 16 May 1989 also contained a clause restricting his ability to travel abroad. The Russian Act of 15 August 1996 required agencies to sign new employment contracts with employees having access to sensitive information. That had not been done in the applicant ’ s case because the Act had come into force on 19 August 1996, that is to say, a day before the applicant ’ s employment ended."

A similar provision was included in the State Secrets Act (see paragraph 23 above). The Court finds therefore that the impugned restriction was imposed in accordance with law.",

The applicant claimed that the domestic courts ’ approach had been excessively formalistic and that they had relied excessively on statements by his former employer, without analysing the necessity for such a restriction in the light of his explanation that his access to classified information had been virtually nil since 1989."
            ],
            [
                "45. The Government submitted that the applicant had worked as a team leader in the Raduga agency. Until his resignation he had been in possession of a “special briefcase”, a seal, a “special notebook” and workbooks that contained top secret information. On 14 August 1996 he had surrendered all these items to the agency. That was the last date on which he had had access to classified information. The restriction was of a temporary nature, spanning over five years after that date."

            [
                "46. The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of that legitimate aim, and that the interference with the rights protected was no greater than was necessary to achieve it. In other words, this requirement, commonly referred to as the test of proportionality, demands that restrictive measures should be appropriate to achieve their protective function ( compare with point 14 of the Human Rights Committee ’ s General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR, cited in paragraph 30 above)."
            ],
            [
                "47. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant surrendered all classified material to his employer on termination of his contract in 1996, that is, before he applied for the travel passport. The applicant submitted that the purpose of his planned trip abroad had been purely private and not related to his previous work, as he had intended to visit his ailing father. This was not contested by the respondent Government."
            ],
            [
                "48. The Court further observes that the Russian law on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets imposed an unqualified restriction on their right to leave Russia, whatever the purpose or duration of their visit. Accordingly, the scope of review by the Inter - agency Commission and the domestic courts was confined to examination of the formal issue as to whether the information to which the applicant had once had access in the Raduga design agency was still sensitive. They did not consider whether the restriction on the applicant ’ s right to travel abroad for private purposes was still necessary for achieving the legitimate aim it had been intended to serve and whether a less restrictive measure could be applied."
            ],
            [
                "49. The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure in issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning “ State secrets ”. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration, and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of “ State secrets ” became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that “the test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ” (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph 30 above )."

            [
                "50. The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe, as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 25 above). The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). However, Russia ’ s undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date (see paragraphs 22 and 34 above)."

                "51. Finally, the Court observes that the restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his country was imposed for a considerable period of time, for five years following the termination of his employment, notwithstanding the fact that that restriction was not explicitly mentioned in the 1994 undertaking (see paragraph 9 above). The impact of that measure must have been particularly heavy on the applicant because he had not been able to travel abroad since the beginning of his employment in 1977, that is, for a total of twenty-four years."

It is not the Court ’ s task to determine whether, in a case of this type, the obligation not to leave the place of residence was per se a proper preventive measure. Under the domestic law, a range of preventive measures could be imposed on a person charged with a criminal offence, with the aim, inter alia, of ensuring his or her presence at the place where the investigation was being conducted. It is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty. An obligation not to leave the area of one ’ s residence is a minimal intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v.

Thus, in July 2004 he complained to the Sabayil District Court that the investigation had been suspended for an unreasonable period and that no procedural steps were being taken. He also briefly but clearly complained that he still remained under the obligation not to leave his place of residence pending the eventual end of the unreasonably lengthy investigation. However, the Sabayil District Court confined itself merely to verifying the lawfulness of the grounds for the suspension of the investigation and failed to examine whether the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement was justified."

The Government have not contested the effectiveness of the avenue of redress which the applicant tried in the present case, namely the judicial review of the prosecuting authorities ’ procedural actions under Articles 442 and 449 of the CCrP. The Court considers that, having exhausted all the possibilities of appeal available to him in the framework of the criminal proceedings in question, the applicant should not be required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for damages ( see, mutatis mutandis, Assenov and Others v.

It considers that this remedy was not capable of expediting the proceedings at issue. Moreover, the Government have not shown that such a claim offered any reasonable prospects of obtaining redress for the delay which had already occurred. Even assuming that the applicant could have obtained compensation for past delay, the Government have failed to show that such proceedings would have been speedier than any other “ordinary” civil suit which could have lasted for years and gone through several levels of jurisdiction ( compare with V.A.M. v.

                "56. The salient question is whether the ban can be regarded as proportionate throughout the entirety of that period (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener v. Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

He repeated his request on 4 March 2004. On the same day the Pleven Regional Court rejected it, observing that there was no indication that the separation between the applicant and his wife had not predated his extradition. Moreover, the applicant had produced no proof to show that the divorce petition had already been heard. He stood accused of a serious wilful offence, in connection with which he had been extradited. The applicant appealed, reiterating his arguments. On 25 March 2004 the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's ruling, holding that, in view of the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the fact that he had prior convictions, he was likely to flee. The proceedings against him had not lasted an unreasonably long time, because their duration was not attributable to the conduct of the authorities. The applicant's family could come to Bulgaria, whereas the lifting of the travel ban would render the earlier extradition pointless."

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria. The refusals which followed his return from Germany in the autumn of 2003 in time for the next trial hearing were particularly hard to explain."

Therefore, no ratione temporis issue arises, because Protocol No. 4 entered into force in respect of Bulgaria on 4 November 2000 (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v.

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

An analogy may be drawn with the Court's case ‑ law under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, where the national courts'failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pre ‑ trial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v.

In the instant case, the authorities, apart from referring to the applicant's conviction and lack of rehabilitation, did not give any reasons for taking away his international passport, and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine his individual situation or explain the need to impose such a measure on him (see paragraph 16 above). They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicant's right to travel abroad and provide sufficient justification for it. That situation could not have been subsequently corrected in judicial review proceedings (see Gochev, cited above, § 54). As already noted in relation to exhaustion of domestic remedies, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act between 2000 and 2010, the courts were not competent to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above). However, in this Court's view, the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country. Such a general and almost automatic restriction cannot be regarded as warranted."

The second ban was imposed by the migration authorities on 6 June 2001 pursuant to a request by the prosecuting authorities and was apparently based on a travel ban which the latter had imposed shortly before that under Article 153a § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 10, 20 and 24 above). The possibility of seeking judicial review of the migration authorities'decision cannot be regarded as effective or offering a reasonable chance of success, because the domestic courts were of the view that the prosecuting authorities'decision to impose a travel ban was binding on the migration authorities and that the proper way of challenging a travel ban was by seeking permission to travel under Article 153a § 2 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, under Article 153a §§ 2 ‑ 5, the applicant was not able to challenge the ban as such, but merely seek permission to travel on specific occasions. The possibility to seek the lifting of the ban as a whole came up only with the entry into force of Article 68 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 above), after the criminal proceedings against the applicant had come to an end. However, in so far as the requests for permission to travel on specific occasions – which could be made at any time without restriction – were capable of relieving the effect which the ban had on the applicant, they could be regarded as remedies against it. The salient question is whether they were effective. At the pre-trial phase the applicant could have sought such permission from the prosecuting authorities, and at the trial phase from the courts dealing with his case. There is no indication that he tried to avail himself of that opportunity and was rebuffed (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, §§ 44 ‑ 46, 13 October 2005, and Hristov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 32461/02, 3 April 2006 ). His allegations concerning the procedure's shortcomings thus appear speculative (see, mutatis mutandis, Belchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39270/98, 6 February 2003; Pekov v. Bulgaria, no. 50358/99, § 91, 30 March 2006 l; and Sabeva v. Bulgaria, no. 44290/07, § 65, 10 June 2010 ). There was nothing in the text of Article 153a of the 1974 Code to suggest that the proceedings for judicial review of a refusal by the prosecutor to grant such permission would be tainted by unfairness or otherwise ineffective. The Court is furthermore unable to accept the applicant's argument that the granting of such permission would not have allowed him to travel abroad because it would not have led to the variation of the measure imposed under section 75(3) of the 1998 Act. As evident from the Supreme Administrative Court's case ‑ law, the granting of such permission constituted grounds to vary the measure imposed by the migration authorities under section 75(3) (see paragraph 24 above)."

However, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act, the courts did not have jurisdiction to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting the possibility to travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above).

As already noted in relation to exhaustion of domestic remedies, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act between 2000 and 2010, the courts were not competent to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above). However, in this Court's view, the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country. Such a general and almost automatic restriction cannot be regarded as warranted."

It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

                "30. Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 guarantees to any person the right to leave any country for any other country of that person’s choice to which he or she may be admitted. The prohibition on the applicant leaving Bulgaria undoubtedly amounted to an interference with that right. The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."
            ],
            [
                "31. The interference was based on section 76(6) of the Identity Papers Act 1998 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), and thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."
            ],
            [
                "32. It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."
            ],
            [
                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."
            ],
            [
                "35. Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."
            ],
            [
                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

Ukraine, no. 14183/02, §§ 59-67, 22 November 2005, and Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above).

Novosibirsk is located more than 3,300 kilometres by road or approximately four hours by airplane from the area of the applicant ’ s ordinary residence and he was not allowed to go back even for a short period of time (compare with Miażdżyk v.

                "50. The Court should first ascertain whether Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 applies to the elections complained of. In this respect, it observes that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees the “choice of the legislature” and that the word “legislature” does not necessarily mean the national parliament: it has to be interpreted in the light of the constitutional structure of the State in question (see Cherepkov v. Russia (dec.), no. 51501/ 99, ECHR 2000-I). In Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, the 1980 constitutional reform had vested in the Flemish Council sufficient competence and powers to make it, alongside the French Community Council and the Walloon Regional Council, a constituent part of the Belgian “legislature”, in addition to the House of Representatives and the Senate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113, p. 23, §53; see also Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, §§ 40-54, ECHR 1999-I, on the application of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Parliament; and X v.

As regards the regional councils, the Commission left open the question whether these organs might be deemed to be part of the legislature in Italy (see Luksch v. Italy, no. 27 614/95, Commission decision of 21 May 1997, DR 89 -B, pp. 76-78)."

The Court therefore considers that the Constitution vested competence and powers in the regional councils that are wide enough to make them a constituent part of the legislature in addition to the parliament.

Although those rights are important, they are not absolute. Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them forth in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for implied limitations. In their internal legal orders, the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of this provision of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see the following judgments: Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, p. 23, § 52; Gitonas and Others v. Greece, 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1 233, § 39; Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2384, § 75; Labita v.

In any case, as far as the latter election is concerned, the Court reiterates its finding that the prolongation of the special police supervision after 2 May 1995 was neither in accordance with law nor necessary (see paragraph 46 above).

It is therefore appropriate to reimburse only in part the costs and expenses alleged by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 59, 15 January 2004 ).

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"

                "86. The Government submitted that the Court had previously recognised that restrictions on the rights guaranteed by the Convention were necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. They referred to the case of Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 48, Series A no. 28), in which the Court acknowledged that democratic societies were threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism and that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

                "87. The Government emphasised that the applicants had gained access to State secrets through their employment and had voluntarily accepted a temporary restriction on their rights, including the right to travel abroad (here they referred, by way of comparison, to Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

                "88. The Government acknowledged that the laws of a majority of member States did not explicitly impose a restriction on the right to travel abroad for individuals aware of State secrets. They alleged however that many countries had put in place “a secret system of measures designed to ensure State control over [such] individuals”. In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The scope of the national courts ’ examination had been confined to a formal verification of the fact that the applicants had had access to State secrets during their employment.

In particular, Mr Berkovich and Mr Ilchenko pointed out that, as could be seen from the domestic proceedings, their employers had not considered that their awareness of State secrets should prevent them from travelling abroad for official purposes. Whereas Russian law did not distinguish between private and official travel, that demonstrated – in the applicants ’ view – the artificial nature of the restriction, as well as the domestic authorities ’ failure to abide by their own regulations."

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition.

The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50).

Taking into account the above considerations, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the present case the mere duration of the application of the preventive measure is insufficient for the Court to conclude that it was disproportionate. In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicants'personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, by contrast to Luordo and the subsequent cases against Italy, the Court must ascertain whether the applicants actually sought to leave the area of their residence and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused."

In particular, they did not submit a copy of their application to leave Kargasok in order to accompany their son to Omsk on 12 July 2001. The Court notes in this regard that the letter of the acting district prosecutor provides no evidence that such an application had been filed. The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office. In the absence of any evidence that the applicants had filed any other applications to leave the place of their residence and, consequently, that any such applications had been refused, the Court can not reach the conclusion that a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the applicants'rights was upset. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the present case the restriction on the applicants'freedom of movement was not disproportionate."

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicants'personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, by contrast to Luordo and the subsequent cases against Italy, the Court must ascertain whether the applicants actually sought to leave the area of their residence and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused."

In particular, they did not submit a copy of their application to leave Kargasok in order to accompany their son to Omsk on 12 July 2001. The Court notes in this regard that the letter of the acting district prosecutor provides no evidence that such an application had been filed. The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office. In the absence of any evidence that the applicants had filed any other applications to leave the place of their residence and, consequently, that any such applications had been refused, the Court can not reach the conclusion that a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the applicants'rights was upset.

                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."

Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus.

The applicants maintained that the restriction on their right to travel abroad had been unnecessary and disproportionate, especially in the light of the fact that some of them had been allowed to go abroad during their employment. In particular, Mr Berkovich and Mr Ilchenko pointed out that, as could be seen from the domestic proceedings, their employers had not considered that their awareness of State secrets should prevent them from travelling abroad for official purposes. Whereas Russian law did not distinguish between private and official travel, that demonstrated – in the applicants ’ view – the artificial nature of the restriction, as well as the domestic authorities ’ failure to abide by their own regulations."

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia ’ s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments."

The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50).

In the present case, the results of the investigation and rogatory enquiry with the Rimini Tribunal could not lead to the existence either of a legitimate impediment or of an ex post one. The Commissario della Legge had according to his prerogatives considered it opportune to decide the case speedily in view of the urgency and gravity of the matter. Indeed, it shared the view that, there not being any legal and binding procedural requirements in this respect, in the urgent circumstances of the case the decision could have been taken even in the absence of one of the parties ( audi alteram partem ). Moreover, the appeal judge considered perplexing the fact that the first applicant was contesting a situation she had created herself. Lastly, as to the impartiality complaint, the first applicant had not challenged or requested the withdrawal of the Commissario della Legge at the relevant time.",

Consequently, even where a mother has been deprived of parental rights - and indeed that is one of the causes of the dispute which she has referred to the Court - her standing as the natural mother suffices to afford her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child ’ s behalf, too, in order to protect his or her interests. Moreover, the conditions governing individual applications are not necessarily the same as national criteria relating to locus standi. National rules in this respect may serve purposes different from those contemplated by Article 34 of the Convention and, whilst those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be so (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

It followed that the domestic court did not exercise any supervision of the work of children ’ s services in that respect. Another supposedly independent expert, the psychologist in charge of monitoring the meetings held at X. ’ s house, was the psychologist of a committee with which relatives of X. were involved.

The Government pointed out that in June 2007 the mother had taken the child to Italy, notwithstanding the decision of 17 April 2007, which held that the child should remain in San Marino ( see paragraph 22 above ), and from 2007 the first applicant had repeatedly refused to allow contact with the father, contrary to the decree of 25 June 2007 (paragraph 29 above). Thus, the impugned decision had been taken in the best interest of the child, having considered that the father was the parent who would have allowed contact with the other parent. The court ’ s conclusion had been based on the objective findings by children ’ s services following their monitoring of the parent-child relationships, which repeatedly found that the mother was hindering the child ’ s contact with the father, to the extent that in 2009 they feared the second applicant was suffering from Parental Alienation Syndrome (paragraph 9 7 above )."

Children ’ s services, as public employees, were subject to Public Employment Law and to supervision by the Social Security Institute. Failure to abide by the duties imposed could lead to disciplinary sanctions as imposed by law through the Disciplinary Board. Children ’ s services personnel were qualified individuals, with degrees in psychology and/or pedagogy with a two year specialisation course in Psychology or with at least five years ’ service in the health sector, who have been successful in a public competition and whose profession therefore guaranteed their independence and impartiality.

They submitted that in 2009 they had received a number of requests from separated parents in respect of their loss of parental rights and/or joint custody. Some of these cases had turned out to be extremely alarming from the point of view of the right to joint parenting and regular contact rights. These complaints mainly concerned children ’ s services. During the association ’ s discussions on child custody, strong criticisms of children ’ s services were voiced by parents, in particular in respect of their lack of qualifications and ineffective support for parents. Many spoke about their distressing experiences in trying to see their children, particularly in cases of parents with dual nationality, who publicly complained that they had faced discriminatory treatment from the services. The association therefore invited children ’ s services and the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Council”) to attend subsequent sessions. Unlike the Council, children ’ s services did not send any representatives. The Council ’ s representative, in reply to questions set, confirmed that in San Marino it sufficed to have a degree in pedagogy without a further professional qualification to be employed by children ’ s services.

Family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child ’ s liberty. Thus, the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (see Nielsen v.

Germany, (dec.) nos. 42402/05 and 42423/05, 29 January 2008 ). However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of contact, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child would be effectively curtailed (see T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 71, ECHR 2001 ‑ V (extracts)."

Where the measures in issue concern parental disputes over their children, it is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating contact and residence disputes, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation. Undoubtedly, consideration of what lies in the best interest of the child is of crucial importance ( see Zawadka, cited above, § 54, and Hokkanen v. Finland, 23 September 1994, § 55, Series A no. 299-A). Moreover, lack of cooperation between separated parents is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt the authorities from their positive obligations under Article 8. It rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the paramount interests of the child ( see Zawadka, cited above, § 67) which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent (see Hoppe v.

The local authority ’ s decision-making process clearly cannot be devoid of influence on the substance of the decision, notably by ensuring that it is based on relevant considerations and is not one-sided, and hence neither is, nor appears to be, arbitrary. Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as “necessary” within the meaning of Article 8 ( see W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 62 and 64 in fine ). In conducting its review in the context of Article 8 the Court may also have regard to the length of the local authority ’ s decision-making process and of any related judicial proceedings. An effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined solely in the light of all relevant considerations and not by the mere passage of time ( ibid. , § 65; see also H. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, § 90, Series A no. 120 )."

Six months later, in June 2007 the domestic court ordered joint custody and that the child should live and attend school for the following school year in Rimini, Italy, where she had established herself with the mother. However, by an order of 21 September 2007 the domestic courts decided that the second applicant should reside in San Marino, as Mr X. had the right to easy and unsupervised contact with his child. On 12 November 2007 joint custody was upheld as being in the best interest of the child. By a decision of 19 February 2008, the court, again upheld joint custody and ordered the child to be returned to San Marino to live with her father and to attend school there. This decision was confirmed on appeal three years later. In the meantime a number of orders had been issued on the matter, upholding joint custody and residence with the father, in San Marino."

Subsequently, contact hours changed to three hours on alternate days, including an overnight stay, and remained subject to the same conditions up to August 2008. Following that date contact hours increased to two to six hours per day, overnight stays, and alternate weekends with the parents, up to entire weeks over the Christmas holiday period. Most of these visits were nevertheless supervised either by the father or his legal representatives, children ’ s services or CTU experts, who videoed the meetings."

They based their decisions on a number of further considerations, such as the relationship between the parents, the inherent problems of joint custody in such cases, particularly were it transpired that one parent was, for the most part, hostile towards the other and hindered contact rights, the attitude and availability of the parents and the specific environments involved. In each of their decisions they relied on detailed and complete reports from the children ’ s services (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 28, 38, 50 and 77 ) which were drawn up following constant and specific requests by the domestic courts. These reports were a result of the constant monitoring performed by the service. From 2007 onwards the courts further had the benefits of reports by ex-parte counsellors and experts, and from 2008 onwards also reports by the CTU. Moreover, the parties had regularly made written and oral submissions before the court and were allowed to air all their requests and concerns, which the courts undoubtedly took into consideration."

In this light, the Court finds it reasonable, that the courts considered it necessary - for the protection of the child ’ s interests - not to maintain in place a sole custody order in favour of the first applicant but to award the parents ’ joint custody, neither does it appear illogical to have opted for residence with the father. It is also noted that the domestic courts did not exclude a change in regime if circumstances so required. Furthermore, the domestic courts took due care to recommend education programmes for the family and to foster the parents ’ reconciliation and co-operation in the best interest of their daughter."

                "185. As to contact rights, the Court has already observed the details of the regime applied (see paragraph 180 above ). It reiterates that the national authorities having the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned are better placed than the international judge to assess such needs. The Court considers that the measures adopted do not appear manifestly arbitrary or unfair. In consequence, it is not for the Court to enter into a detailed assessment of the most appropriate contact arrangements. It suffices for the Court to note that these rights were not denied or suppressed at any moment, the applicants having maintained constant and regular contact with each other, and the first applicant having retained joint custody over the second applicant. While supervision and often limitation as to the venue of contact meetings (the father ’ s residence), must have restricted the purpose of visits between mother and child, limiting to some extent their contact and the opportunity to develop their relationship - a matter which was in both of their interests and particularly the child ’ s, whose interest is paramount - the Court considers that monitoring by the child services was necessary to allow the domestic courts to make informed decisions as to custody and contact rights. Moreover, such monitoring also served to ensure the child ’ s well being. The Court is ready to accept that while there was no threat of violence or serious health issues (see, a contrario, Gluhaković v. Croatia, no. 21188/09, § 63, 12 April 2011 ) there could have been a risk of psychological abuse as evidenced by the suggestions that the child might develop Parent Alienation Syndrome, thus justifying the father ’ s presence at meetings. This having been said, the Court refutes the Government ’ s argument that such limitations were necessary as a precautionary measure against a possible abduction by the first applicant. The Court notes that when the first applicant moved to San Marino, she had informed the judge (see paragraph 26), similarly, when requested to submit the second applicant ’ s passport she did so (see paragraph 56). While she appeared to be more hesitant to submit the second passport, the Court notes that in the meantime it was Mr X. who had requested a second passport and who was allowed to travel with the child (see paragraphs 70 and 92). Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated by the courts that travel was banned unless authorised by it (see paragraphs 51, 70 and 99), a measure which in principle deterred unilateral decisions to take the child away. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which gives objective grounds for any fear of the applicants ’ absconding, particularly since the first applicant ’ s family lived in Rimini, not far from San Marino, and indeed any mere suspicions or fears which Mr X. might have had had neither been substantiated nor confirmed by the courts. Lastly, the Court notes that the presence of the parties ’ lawyers had not been court ordered, and indeed it was the children ’ s services that requested the court to prohibit such a practice (see paragraph 69 above). Thus, any discomfort caused in this respect could have easily been avoided by the parties ’ good will."

As to the applicants ’ contention that the children ’ s services were biased and unqualified, the Court considers that quite apart from the submissions made by the third-party intervener association, the matter remains unsubstantiated, and in any event the Court has not discerned any proof of the lack of effectiveness of such a service, particularly where, as in the present case, the proposals made by the service do not appear to be manifestly arbitrary or discriminatory. While it is true that the domestic courts have a duty to exercise constant vigilance, particularly as regards action taken by social services, to ensure the latter ’ s conduct does not defeat the authorities ’ decisions (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], cited above, § 179), the Court notes that in the present case, the applicants had ample possibilities to criticise and contest the children ’ s services qualifications, actions and findings in the contentious proceedings, as in fact the first applicant had done in relation to the children ’ s services failure to facilitate her contact rights (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 56 above).

As to the hearing of 19 February 2008 on the merits of her and Mr X. ’ s requests, the Court considers that given the fact that the first applicant ’ s representative had been duly notified of the date of the hearing (see paragraph 43 above), that at the actual hearing she had originally been represented by co-counsel, and that she had had the opportunity to submit written pleadings, it cannot be said that her involvement had not been effective at that stage. This is more so in view of the fact that in cases concerning a person ’ s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. In this light, and bearing in mind that the decision of 19 February 2008 only confirmed the retention of a joint custody regime which had previously been decided (see paragraphs 28 and 38 above ) the Court finds reasonable the refusal of the domestic court to adjourn the hearing."

As to the overall length of the proceedings the Court notes that the first applicant intervened in the custody and contact proceedings in December 2006 and the proceedings are to date still pending. However, it is evident from the facts of the case that there have not been any significant lapses of inactivity, or adjournments for reasons related to internal organisation (see, a contrario Veljkov v.

Indeed it also transpires that the parties ’ requests for urgent hearings had been immediately followed up, with the domestic courts calling on extraordinary hearings of their own motion when necessary (see, for example, paragraph 43 above). Thus, although parallel proceedings and the fact that the courts had to decide a number of ancillary matters simultaneously must have detracted from the required speediness of custody proceedings, the Court considers that overall the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the proceedings with the requisite diligence."

The only reason given by the domestic court for such a refusal was that the applicant had no right to such materials, children ’ s services being the judge ’ s auxiliary (see paragraph 77 above). The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning and no other compelling reasons supporting their refusal to provide the video recordings have been put forward. However, it notes that nine months later the parties ’ requests for CTU recordings and all relevant documentation had been granted (see paragraph 10 4 above), thus, the first applicant could make use of such relevant information for the purposes of the proceedings which were still ongoing.

                "19. In its report (paragraph 43), the Commission sets out a summary of the case-law in this area:",
                "\" ... The existence of preventive measures is not in itself contrary to the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations, not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts, but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 27 of 1959 and judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Because of their particular object, preventive measures do not relate to the commission of a specific unlawful act but to a pattern of behaviour defined by law as conduct indicating the existence of danger to society (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Consequently, in the Italian legal system, there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures. The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act.",
                "In other words, a criminal penalty relates to an offence already committed, whereas a preventive measure is intended to reduce the risk of future offences (see, mutatis mutandis, Constitutional Court, judgment no. 53 of 1968, concerning security measures).",
                "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different, not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter. For example, the presumption of innocence enunciated in Article 27 of the Constitution does not concern preventive measures, which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Similarly, such measures do not fall within the scope of Article 25 para. 2 of the Constitution, which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions. The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in the Court of Cassation with regard to confiscation orders under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. The Court of Cassation has ruled, firstly, that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Piraino judgment of 30 January 1985). Secondly, the Court of Cassation has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive, as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered (Court of Cassation, Oliveri judgment of 12 May 1986) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force (Court of Cassation, Pipitone judgment of 4 January 1985).",
                "In spite of these limitations, preventive measures remain open to thorough scrutiny of their compatibility with the Constitution.",
                "As far back as 1956 the Constitutional Court ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law, where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 11 of 1956).",
                "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy. Furthermore, the above two conditions are closely linked. Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 177 of 1980).",
                "The case-law of the Court of Cassation is in this respect entirely consistent with that of the Constitutional Court; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence, any violation of those rights entailing their nullity (see, for example, Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1255 of 29 June 1984 in the Santoro case).",
                "The Court of Cassation has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. In particular, it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the rights of the defence, since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal (Court of Cassation, previously cited Pipitone judgment).",
                "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property (Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution), the Court of Cassation has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest. This applies in connection with possessions of unlawful origin or their use (Court of Cassation, previously cited Oliveri and Pipitone judgments)."

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

As a result of its unlawful activities, in particular drug-trafficking, and its international connections, this \"organisation\" has an enormous turnover that is subsequently invested, inter alia, in the real property sector. Confiscation, which is designed to block these movements of suspect capital, is an effective and necessary weapon in the combat against this cancer. It therefore appears proportionate to the aim pursued, all the more so because it in fact entails no additional restriction in relation to seizure.",

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicant ’ s personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, the Court must ascertain whether the applicant had a genuine interest in leaving his country of residence or actually sought to leave and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused ( see Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above, § 44 )."

In addition, the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the prolonged application of the preventive measure before the courts, pleading first that the measure had prevented him from obtaining a job and subsequently that it had prevented him from carrying out his job, which involved travel abroad. However, no actual proof for these claims or for any possible loss of income caused by the preventive measure was provided by the applicant. In addition, the applicant admitted in his submissions before the Court that his wife, children and his mother reside in his home town in Romania. At the same time, according to the documents submitted by the parties, the domestic courts thoroughly analysed the applicant ’ s submissions and found that the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement was justified in the specific circumstances of his case. On this point, the Court also notes that the applicant is currently at large after failing to return to serve the remainder of his prison sentence. In view of the above, the Court sees no reason to depart from the findings of the domestic courts in the present case.
