                "49. The Court notes that the confiscation of the applicant’s vessel was a permanent measure which entailed a conclusive transfer of ownership (see Andonoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 16225/08, § 30, 17 September 2015; and to a converse effect, JGK Statyba Ltd and Guselnikovas v. Lithuania, no. 3330/12, §115, 5 November 2013; and Hábenczius v. Hungary, no. 44473/06, § 28, 21 October 2014). The Government did not argue that there was any possibility for the applicant to seek restoration of his possession (see, conversely, C.M. v. France (dec.), no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII). The Court therefore considers that the measure amounts, in the circumstances of the present case, to a deprivation of property (see B.K.M. Lojistik Tasimacilik Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Slovenia, no. 42079/12, §§ 37-38, 17 January 2017 and S.C. Service Benz Com S.R.L. v. Romania, no. 58045/11, § 30, 4 July 2017 ).",

It held that it was of no relevance whether the applicant had or had not been aware of the purpose of the use of the vessel by K.D, because by virtue of Article 66 of GEO 23/2008, the confiscation measure was not conditioned by the subjective attitude of the owner of the vessel, in the event that the owner was not also the perpetrator; from that respect, Article 66 represented the special norm, thus departing from the general norm (that is, Article 118 of the Criminal Code, hereinafter “the CC”; see paragraph 34 below)."

He further stated that a special confiscation measure should be applied when the goods in question would serve as potential compensation for the injured parties; he contended that in similar cases where the special confiscation measure was applicable, the domestic courts had ordered that the forfeiture be carried out in the form of a monetary equivalent (see domestic practice, paragraph 36 below)."

They stated that the vessel and the fishing equipment were the applicant’s property and that the latter had not been aware of the use made of the rented items by K.D. in the Romanian exclusive economic zone. According to them, the confiscation of the vessel was disproportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, given the significant value of the vessel and the absence of any proven damage.

This approach was clear and foreseeable in the sense that the confiscation measure applied on the basis of Article 66 was not automatic, but was always assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. Relevant case-law in which the courts had ordered the confiscation of other Turkish vessels was submitted, the courts pointing to the frequency of offences similar to those in the present case committed by fishing crews cruising under the Turkish flag. The courts had also indicated that there was a frequent practice of dissimulating the real owner of a vessel by having it registered in the name of a different person from its commander, so as to prevent its potential confiscation from a third party from being ordered.",

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many authorities, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, § 48, Series A no. 108, and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 185, ECHR 2012)"

The Court notes that the confiscation of the applicant’s vessel was a permanent measure which entailed a conclusive transfer of ownership (see Andonoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 16225/08, § 30, 17 September 2015; and to a converse effect, JGK Statyba Ltd and Guselnikovas v. Lithuania, no. 3330/12, §115, 5 November 2013; and Hábenczius v. Hungary, no. 44473/06, § 28, 21 October 2014). The Government did not argue that there was any possibility for the applicant to seek restoration of his possession (see, conversely, C.M. v. France (dec.), no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII). The Court therefore considers that the measure amounts, in the circumstances of the present case, to a deprivation of property (see B.K.M. Lojistik Tasimacilik Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Slovenia, no. 42079/12, §§ 37-38, 17 January 2017 and S.C. Service Benz Com S.R.L. v. Romania, no. 58045/11, § 30, 4 July 2017 ).",

The Court reiterates that in order to be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, an interference with the right of property must be effected “in the public interest” and “subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law”. The interference must strike a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of the property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem. Thirdly, confiscation measures may be applied not only to the direct proceeds of crime but also to property, including any incomes and other indirect benefits, obtained by converting or transforming the direct proceeds of crime or intermingling them with other, possibly lawful, assets. Finally, confiscation measures may be applied not only to persons directly suspected of criminal offences but also to any third parties which hold ownership rights without the requisite bona fide with a view to disguising their wrongful role in amassing the wealth in question."

In particular, he complained that the confiscation of his property and that of his family members amounted to a criminal punishment being imposed on him in the absence of a final conviction establishing his guilt, and that he should not have been made to bear the burden of proving his innocence, that is, the lawfulness of the disputed property. He also complained that the confiscation of the property in such circumstances was in breach of his right to be presumed innocent of the corruption charges. The first applicant also stated that he and his family had acquired the property in question well before the amendments of 1 3 February 2004 were enacted and that, consequently, the retroactive extension of those provisions to their situation was unconstitutional. For those reasons, he argued that the confiscation procedure provided for by the impugned provisions of the CCP and CAP had been arbitrary and amounted to a violation of the constitutional guarantee of protection of his private property."

Given the “civil” nature of the proceedings in question, it was acceptable that the burden of proof in the proceedings should be shifted onto the respondent, the second applicant.

At the outset the Government asked the Court to take note of the scale of the corruption phenomenon that had been ravaging the country prior to the launching of a vast array of anti-corruption measures by the authorities in February 2004. The corrupt environment had been particularly apparent in the Ajarian Autonomous Republic, in whose government the first applicant had occupied high-ranking posts at the material time. On the other hand, only a few years after the State had undertaken a number of crucial legislative initiatives to bolster efforts to combat corruption, of which administrative confiscation constituted a major part, a firm trend of significant reduction in corruption could be readily observed, from 2006 onwards. In 20 09 the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index had increased Georgia ’ s score from 1.8 in 2003 to 4.1, thus ranking it 66th out of 174 countries ( see paragraphs 6 9 - 73 above )."

The Government emphasised that all those positive results in the fight against corruption could never have been achieved without the mechanism of administrative confiscation which had been applied in the applicants ’ case. They briefly described the nature of that legal mechanism. In particular, administrative confiscation did not constitute a part of criminal proceedings and was not of a punitive nature but, on the contrary, was of a civil-law, compensatory nature, being aimed at remedying the pecuniary damage caused either to private individuals or to the State ( see paragraphs 49-54 above). The Government stated that such a procedure – confiscation of the property in question in the absence of a final criminal conviction, with the burden of proof being shifted onto the respondent – was in full conformity with the relevant international standards. In fact, it was the Council of Europe bodies and the OECD who had been the first to insist that Georgia should introduce such a measure ( see paragraphs 6 6-70 above)."

Observing that the proceedings for confiscation of the applicants ’ property had strictly followed the judicial procedure laid down for that purpose by Article 37 § 1 of the CCP and Articles 21 §§ 4 to 11 of the CAP, the Government submitted that the resulting confiscation had been lawful. Those legal provisions were readily accessible to the public and their legal consequences were clear and foreseeable to the public at large, including the applicants. Furthermore, it could not be said that the legislative amendments in question had suddenly introduced revolutionary methods in the fight against corruption in February 2004, as seven years prior to those amendments there had already existed a law providing for the principles of prevention, exposure and eradication of corruption and the need to hold corrupt officials criminally, administratively and disciplinarily liable for their illicit deeds, namely the 1997 Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service (see paragraphs 44-48 above). The Government then argued, by reference to the Court ’ s judgments in the cases of AGOSI ( cited above, § 51 ) and Raimondo (cited above, § 29), that confiscation should be considered as a measure to control the use of property."

The Government firmly maintained that the introduction of the procedure of administrative confiscation served the public interest of the eradication of corruption in the public service. As to the implication of “relatives” and “connected persons”, that particular aspect was intended as a response to the well-known and widespread practice whereby corrupt public officials would hide the proceeds of their illicit deeds by fictitiously registering those proceeds in the names of their friends or relatives. In doing so, corrupt officials attempted to avoid financial accountability before the public, meaning that the legal obligation to submit financial declarations in their own names, as initially provided for by the 1997 Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service, was deprived of any real value. The confiscation of the applicants ’ property had therefore been justified by socio-legal and economic considerations, namely the need to eradicate corruption and to return the illicitly acquired property to the lawful owners or, in the absence of such, to the State budget."

However, the applicants had failed to prove, in the relevant judicial proceedings, that they had had legal incomes that were sufficient to enable them to acquire the property, which had a much higher value. In this connection the Government also stated that, given that the impugned confiscation represented a measure to control the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the respondent State enjoyed a particularly wide margin of appreciation in the context of the policy of fighting such a major crime as corruption.",

In that regard they stated that the first applicant had been convicted of the offences with which he had been charged on 25 August 2004 (see paragraph 9 above); the launching of that criminal case had acted as a spur to the initiation of the administrative confiscation proceedings, as late as January 2010, that is, five years after the confiscation order had become final (see paragraph 36 above; no copy of the first applicant ’ s conviction was submitted). The applicants also complained that the burden of proof in the confiscation proceedings had been shifted onto them, arguing that, according to the general principles of criminal procedure, it was always the public prosecutor who should carry the burden of proving a defendant ’ s guilt beyond reasonable doubt."

Maintaining that the confiscation measure in their case amounted to a criminal sanction, the applicants also complained that the amendments of 13 February 2004 to the Code of Administrative Procedure had been applied retroactively in their case, since the property confiscated had in reality been acquired between November 1997 and May 2004.

They complained that those facts had not been taken into account by the Supreme Court of Georgia during the relevant cassation proceedings. As to the reasons for the first, third and fourth applicants ’ failure to attend the court hearings, the applicants explained that the first applicant had by that time already fled from Georgia to Russia for fear of criminal prosecution, whilst the remaining two applicants had simply had no trust in the country ’ s judicial system."

Furthermore, any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate public (or general) interest. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v.

Thus, as far back as 1997 the Act on Conflict of Interests and Corruption in the Public Service had already addressed such issues as corruption offences and the obligation of public officials to declare and justify the origins of their property and that of their close entourage, subject to possible criminal, administrative or disciplinary liability the exact nature of which was to be regulated by separate laws governing breaches of those anti ‑ corruption requirements (see paragraphs 44-48 above). That being so, it is clear that the amendment of 13 February 2004 merely regulated afresh the pecuniary aspects of the existing anti-corruption legal standards. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the “lawfulness” requirement contained in Article of Protocol No. 1 cannot normally be construed as preventing the legislature from controlling the use of property or otherwise interfering with pecuniary rights via new retrospective provisions regulating continuing factual situations or legal relations anew (see Azienda Agricola Silverfunghi S.a.s. and Others, cited above, § 104, 24 June 2014; Arras and Others v. Italy, no. 17972/07, § 81, 14 February 2012; Huitson v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 50131/12, §§ 31-35, 13 January 2015; and Khoniakina, cited above, § 74 ).

As regards the legitimacy of the aim pursued by the impugned confiscation, the Court observes that the measure formed an essential part of a larger legislative package aimed at intensifying the fight against corruption in the public service (see paragraphs 49, 82 and 8 3 above ). Having regard to the domestic legal framework (see paragraphs 52-54 and 8 5 above), it is evident that the rationale behind the forfeiture of wrongfully acquired property and unexplained wealth owned by persons accused of serious offences committed while in public office and from their family members and close relatives was twofold, having both a compensatory and a preventive aim."

The compensatory aspect consisted in the obligation to restore the injured party in civil proceedings to the status which had existed prior to the unjust enrichment of the public official in question, by returning wrongfully acquired property either to its previous lawful owner or, in the absence of such, to the State. This was, for instance, a consequence of the proceedings in rem in the present case, where one of the houses in the first applicant ’ s wrongful possession turned out to have been obtained from a third party as the result of duress; that third party, a private individual, then acquired entitlement to benefit from the confiscation of that particular property (see paragraphs 34 and 3 6 above, as well as the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Tchitchinadze, cited above, §§ 9, 13 and 16). The aim of the civil proceedings in rem was to prevent unjust enrichment through corruption as such, by sending a clear signal to public officials already involved in corruption or considering so doing that their wrongful acts, even if they passed unscaled by the criminal justice system, would nevertheless not procure pecuniary advantage either for them or for their families (see, mutatis mutandis, Raimondo, cited above, § 30; Veits, cited above, § 71; and Silickienė v.

They considered it to be unreasonable ( i ) that the domestic law allowed for confiscation of their property as having been wrongfully acquired and/or being unexplained, without the first applicant ’ s guilt on corruption charges having first been proved and ( ii ) that the burden of proof in the associated proceedings had been shifted onto them.",

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of the property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem. Thirdly, confiscation measures may be applied not only to the direct proceeds of crime but also to property, including any incomes and other indirect benefits, obtained by converting or transforming the direct proceeds of crime or intermingling them with other, possibly lawful, assets. Finally, confiscation measures may be applied not only to persons directly suspected of criminal offences but also to any third parties which hold ownership rights without the requisite bona fide with a view to disguising their wrongful role in amassing the wealth in question."

It was on the basis of those internationally acclaimed standards for combatting serious offences which entail unjust enrichment that the Council of Europe Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti ‑ Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) and the OECD ’ s Anti ‑ Corruption Network for Transition Economies, noticing the alarming levels of corruption in the country at all levels, repeatedly advised the Georgian authorities that they undertake legislative measures to ensure that the confiscation of proceeds, including value confiscations, applied mandatorily to all corruption and corruption-related offences and that confiscation from third parties should also be possible. The Court observes that the domestic authorities put the received instructions into practice by adopting the amendment of 13 February 2004. As far back as April and June 2006, and then again in September 2013, the above-mentioned international legal expert bodies commended the authorities for having largely complied with their instructions. They noted that, thanks to the introduction of civil proceedings in rem in addition to the possibility of confiscation through criminal proceedings, the Georgian legislation had been brought into line with the appropriate requirements of the international legislation, and in particular with the relevant Council of Europe Conventions, although they still warned the Georgian authorities against possible misuse of that procedure, calling for the utmost transparency in that regard (see paragraphs 6 6 - 73 above ). Indeed, the Court considers it important to emphasise that those legislative measures considerably helped Georgia to move in the right direction in combating the corruption (see paragraph 73 above)."

                "107. The Court also recalls previous cases in which it was required to examine, from the standpoint of the proportionality test of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, broadly similar procedures for the forfeiture of property linked to the alleged commission of various serious offences entailing unjust enrichment. As regards property presumed to have been acquired either in full or in part with the proceeds of drug-trafficking offences or other illicit activities of mafia-type or criminal organisations, the Court did not see any problem in finding the confiscation measures to be proportionate even in the absence of a conviction establishing the guilt of the accused persons. The Court also found it legitimate for the relevant domestic authorities to issue confiscation orders on the basis of a preponderance of evidence which suggested that the respondents ’ lawful incomes could not have sufficed for them to acquire the property in question. Indeed, whenever a confiscation order was the result of civil proceedings in rem which related to the proceeds of crime derived from serious offences, the Court did not require proof “beyond reasonable doubt” of the illicit origins of the property in such proceedings. Instead, proof on a balance of probabilities or a high probability of illicit origins, combined with the inability of the owner to prove the contrary, was found to suffice for the purposes of the proportionality test under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The domestic authorities were further given leeway under the Convention to apply confiscation measures not only to persons directly accused of offences but also to their family members and other close relatives who were presumed to possess and manage the ill-gotten property informally on behalf of the suspected offenders, or who otherwise lacked the necessary bona fide status (see Raimondo, cited above, § 30; Arcuri and Others v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 52024/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII; Morabito and Others v. Italy ( dec. ), 58572/00, ECHR 7 June 2005; Butler v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 41661/98, 27 June 2002; Webb v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 56054/00, 10 February 2004; and Saccoccia v. Austria, no. 69917/01, §§ 87 ‑ 91, 18 December 2008; compare also with the more recent case of Silickienė, cited above, § § 60-70, where a confiscation measure was applied to the widow of a corrupt public official )."

Having regard to all the above considerations the Court finds, by analogy, that the civil proceedings in rem in the present case, conducted under the procedure regulated by Article 37 § 1 of the CCP and Article 21 §§ 4 to 11 of the CAP, can likewise not be considered to have been arbitrary or to have upset the proportionality test under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection the Court also attaches importance to the similar conclusions of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, which found the civil proceedings in rem to be devoid of any arbitrariness (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 43 above) Indeed, it was only reasonable to expect all three applicants – one of whom had been directly accused of corruption in a separate set of criminal proceedings, whilst the remaining two were presumed, as the accused ’ s family members, to have benefited unduly from the proceeds of his crime – to discharge their part of the burden of proof by refuting the prosecutor ’ s substantiated suspicions about the wrongful origins of their assets. Moreover, those civil proceedings for confiscation clearly formed part of a policy aimed at the prevention and eradication of corruption in the public service, and the Court reiterates that in implementing such policies, respondent States must be given a wide margin of appreciation with regard to what constitutes the appropriate means of applying measures to control the use of property such as the confiscation of all types of proceeds of crime (see, for instance, Yildirim v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 38602/02, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV, and Butler, cited above ).",

Those summonses were served at the applicants ’ postal addresses twice, with the domestic court even postponing a hearing on one occasion, but the first and fourth applicants still failed to avail themselves of their procedural rights (see paragraphs 18, 19, 24 and 25 above). The first applicant ’ s reference to the fact that he was seeking to evade the criminal investigation at that time (see paragraph 90 above) is irrelevant in this regard, since he and the fourth applicant could have designated lawyers to represent their interests at first instance, as they did subsequently before the cassation court ( compare with Bongiorno and Others v. Italy, no. 4514/07, § 49, 5 January 2010 ).

Italy (no. 2 ) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009), with the result that they failed to refute the prosecutor ’ s claim.

That evidence led the domestic courts to the finding that the considerable assets acquired by the Gogitidze family during the tenure of the first applicant in public office could not have been financed by his official salaries alone, whilst the remaining applicants had had no other significant sources of income either. A careful examination of the applicants ’ financial situation confirmed the existence of a considerable discrepancy between their income and their wealth, and that discrepancy, which was a well-documented factual finding, then became the basis for confiscation."

As to the criminal origin of the assets, the judge held that previous domestic case-law had established that in order to find someone guilty of money laundering it was not necessary to have a previous conviction for the underlying, predicate offence, or to know its perpetrator. It sufficed instead to have reasonable evidence ( prove logiche ) of the criminal origin of the money in question. The criminal origin of the money was an objective prerequisite to be autonomously ascertained by the judge in the money laundering case. It was thus not important to ascertain a specific predicate offence if a plurality of elements showed the illicit origin of the money. In the case at hand, the criminal origin of the assets had been shown by the above-mentioned Italian criminal judgment against B. together with other relevant elements. In particular, the judge quoted a part of the Italian judgment which described the criminal career of B. and his previous convictions for inter alia, fighting, causing personal injury, carrying of weapons and, after 1975, handling and receiving stolen goods, multiple instances of theft, owning unjustified assets and drug dealing."

This fact, however, could not lead to exclude the criminal origin of all the sum at issue since, inter alia, ( i ) B. ’ s criminal record from 1975 included multiple offences each of which was able to produce a relevant criminal profit; (ii) a disproportion existed between the legitimate income of the applicants (and their family) and the assets in their possession; (iii) the applicants had tried to demonstrate the licit origin of the assets (such as from their family business and the sale of immovable property) but their explanation had not relied on any evidence and there had been some contradictions between the statements made by each applicant ’ s legal counsel in this respect; (iv) it was unreasonable that the applicants had decided to deposit the money in a foreign bank far from the centre of interest of their family ’ s businesses and this was a further indication of their attempt to hide the criminal origin of the assets."

Nevertheless, the court noted that the sum deposited in the bank account had had a criminal origin in the absence of any explanation as to the origin of the money (which led to the purchase of properties, the sale of which resulted in the sums at issue). Indeed the fact that relevant fiscal controls did not exist at the time did not suffice to prove the licit origin of the funds. Further, the transfer of such money into banks in San Marino showed the attempt to make such money untraceable precisely to hide their initial origin.

He further considered that the confiscation, independently from any investigation concerning the possessor, his/her criminal liability or dangerousness, constituted a mere consequence of the status ( condizione giuridica ) of the property and therefore was devoid of any punitive nature. As argued by the Attorney General, “crime cannot pay” – in all European States laundered money could not be allowed to circulate. In the light of the applicable law and international norms the Judge of Criminal Appeals had correctly applied the confiscation of those sums having illicit origin, and the measure had been lawful and proportionate."

Relying on European Court of Human Rights case-law, the judge for extraordinary remedies held that, contrary to the argument raised by the applicants, judicial interpretation of laws did not go against the principle of legal certainty when it was justified by the need to adapt laws to the existing realities, socio-economic needs or international obligations. Given the context, the measure had been necessary in a democratic society. The criminal pervasiveness of the conduct at issue and the multiplier effect on criminal activities, their adverse impact on the regularity of economic activities, the destabilising effects on the economic market and the negative impact on the image of the country and its international credibility were all convincing and imperative reasons justifying the measure.",

In their view the remedy was unnecessary and could not change their victim status since it could not redress their situation. They submitted that they had not had a fraudulent intent to mislead the Court and that their omission did not deal with the core issue of the case. They distinguished their situation from that where applicants had omitted to inform the Court that they had been successful in pursuing such a remedy, i.e., a situation where domestically the authorities would have had provided redress for the infringements, thus, impinging on their victim status."

San Marino (( dec. ), no. 35430/97, 28 May 2002). The situation may be different now in the light of the fact that the judge for extraordinary remedies has established his competence to examine human rights issues as happened in the applicants ’ case, and as appears to be the case since 2016 (see paragraph 36 above). Indeed, it would appear to be in the light of such developments that the applicants attempted the remedy. However, the Court has not yet had the opportunity to examine, on the basis of relevant observations by the parties, whether the revision proceedings are still to be considered an extraordinary remedy, or whether such proceedings are a remedy for the purposes of Articles 13 and 35 § 1 of the Convention in a given situation, and in such circumstances there is no doubt that the applicants should have informed the Court about the remedy they pursued."

However, according to the applicants that provision was intended to provide for the confiscation of possessions destined to committing crimes or which constituted a crime or which where dangerous, and thus the confiscation of sums of money should not have fallen under its remit. In their view by relying on that provision the judge was extending the domestic court ’ s remit by analogy, which was not possible in the criminal law sphere. In their view he had applied something in between Article 147 (1) which was a punitive measure and Article 147 (2) which was a preventive measure despite both provisions not being applicable in their case.

The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting ‑ point in any assessment of the existence of a “penalty” is whether the measure in question is imposed following a decision that a person is guilty of a criminal offence. However, other factors may also be taken into account as relevant in this connection, namely the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Ilnseher v.

France, no. 42875/10, § 42, 3 September 2015), without it being regarded as decisive when it comes to establishing the nature of the measure (see Valico S.r.l. v.

However, the absence of a conviction does not suffice to rule out the applicability of that provision (see G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 217).

As regards the classification of confiscation under Article 147 (2), the Court notes that under domestic law the entire provision, including with reference to confiscations applied on conviction, fell within Title VI of the Criminal Code entitled “Civil obligations and other effects resulting from offences” (paragraph 31 above). It follows that this title may cover both punitive and preventive, or other type of measures. In the Court ’ s view therefore, this does not indicate that the confiscation in the present case was surely a penalty (see, a contrario, G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 221)."

                "Secondly, according to the relevant doctrine in San Marino (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above) this was a preventive measure, independent of criminal proceedings and a finding of guilt (compare, M. v. Italy, no. 12386/86, Commission decision of 15 April 1991);",
                "Thirdly, the Court accepts that the measure is designed to prevent the unlawful use of the funds, and in consequence also preventing the commission of further crimes. In this connection the Court notes that Article 199 bis states that the use or transfer of money which one knows was obtained as a result of crimes constitutes money laundering (see paragraph 30 above). The Court observes that it has been established that the funds have an illicit origin and the applicants are aware of that now. It follows that the applicants could be charged with new acts of money laundering had they to use or transfer such money. Against this legal background, the Court confirms the preventive character of such a confiscation designed to prevent the unlawful use of these proceeds, an aim also sought by various international instruments (see paragraphs 38 ‑ 40 above) (compare also, Gogitidze and Others v. Georgia, no. 36862/05, § 101, 12 May 2015). In such circumstances and particularly in view of the applicant ’ s acquittal precisely on the basis of the lack of intention, it cannot be said that the measure also included a punitive purpose (see, a contrario, Sofia v. San Marino ( dec. ), no. 38977/15, § 63, 2 May 2017, and Vannucci v. San Marino, ( dec. ), no. 33898/15, 28 March 2017, concerning a confiscation of laundered assets, or the equivalent, respectively, under Article 147 (3) of the Criminal Code which were applicable after conviction, and Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, where the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking followed a finding of guilt and its amount depended on the degree of culpability of the applicant)."

As regards the procedures for the adoption and enforcement of the confiscation measure, the Court observes that, undeniably, the measure is meted out by the courts of criminal jurisdiction. However, this cannot in itself be decisive (see by implication, Dassa Foundations and Others v. Liechtenstein, ( dec. ), no. 696/05, 10 July 2007). Indeed, it is a common feature of several jurisdictions for criminal courts to take decisions of a non ‑ punitive nature as, for example, the possibility for criminal courts to order civil reparation measures for the victim of the criminal act. Furthermore, the Court observes that in the present case those courts had to assess the origin of the funds, and during those proceedings, which the applicants have not considered unfair, and during which the applicants have had the right to present their defence, it was established that the origin of the funds had been illicit. This decision was based on the evidence related to their father ’ s dealings, including a criminal judgment against him, and the applicants ’ inability to prove the lawful origin of the money. Thus, the assessment had been objective and based on relevant evidence in the absence of a successful rebuttal, and therefore must be distinguished from mere suspicions or subjective speculation (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v.

Lastly, as regards the severity of the measure, the Court reiterates that this factor is not in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 82, ECHR 2013). The Court considers that the confiscation of the sums in the present case is not sufficiently severe as to warrant its classification as a criminal penalty. The Court has previously held that confiscation is not a measure confined to the sphere of criminal law, but that it is encountered widely in the sphere of administrative law where items liable to confiscation include illegally imported goods (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108), items considered dangerous in themselves (such as weapons, explosive or infected cattle) and property connected, even if only indirectly, with a criminal activity (see M. v. Italy, Yildirim, and Bowler International Unit, all cited above, and more recently Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § 126 ). Each confiscation must be seen in its context; money laundering directly threatens the rule of law as is also evident by the action of the Council of Europe and other international bodies in this field. In particular the Council of Europe Conventions on the matter have bound States to criminalise the laundering of the proceeds of crime and provide for other measures aimed at having a strong criminal policy to combat this growing national and international phenomenon the complexities of which are unprecedented (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 181, 13 April 2017). In such circumstances the Court considers that the preventive measure was necessary and appropriate given the public interest involved (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v.

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fair ‑ trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person ’ s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public.

Moreover, quite apart from being preventive and not punitive (see paragraph 65 above), the confiscation concerned funds in the applicants ’ possession which were found to be illicit as a result of crimes not attributed to the applicants, but to third persons (who had committed the predicate offence of the money laundering with which the applicants were charged).

The first one, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property in general. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, Immobiliare Saffi v.

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, § 51). In other cases, where a confiscation measure had been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” (within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, the Court has again held that such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and in such cases, also, the measure had to be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § § 94 and 97 )."

In their view the Criminal Code did not provide for a situation as the one in the present case where the sums were assumed to be “profit” of other crimes which were not examined in the context of the procedure during which the measure was applied. They considered that the sums had been confiscated because they were the product of illegal activity (Article 147 (1)), and not because they were in themselves dangerous or constituting a crime as required by Article 147 (2), which was applied to them."

Furthermore, any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate public (or general) interest. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v.

In this regard, the Court reiterates that a State may be responsible for debts of a State-owned company, even if the company is a separate legal entity, provided that it does not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Mykhaylenky and Others v.

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company’s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control)."

In response, the SFRY introduced a system for “redepositing” foreign currency, allowing banks to transfer citizens’ foreign-currency deposits to the NBY, which assumed the currency risk (section 51 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1977 [9] ). Although the system was legally optional, in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign-currency accounts with foreign banks, which were necessary to make payments abroad, nor were they allowed to grant foreign-currency loans. Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the NBY according to one of the following two methods: either the “accounting” or “pro forma” method, or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. The accounting method was used far more often, as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the NBY without having to pay fees to foreign banks (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § 36, 3 October 2008; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53). According to an internal report of the NBY of September 1988 [10], by 30 June 1988 an equivalent of approximately USD 9 billion had been redeposited with the NBY, of which only around USD 1.4 billion (that is, slightly above 15%) had been physically transferred to the NBY’s many foreign accounts.

Some of those funds were transferred back to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs (during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited). Indeed, in the period from 1984 to 1991, DEM 244,665,082 was transferred to Ljubljana and DEM 41,469,528 (that is, less than 17%) back to Sarajevo. The funds which had not been transferred back to Sarajevo were redeposited with the NBY according to one of the two methods described in paragraph 17 above: the “accounting” or “pro forma” method (in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left Ljubljana), or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY.

Failing an agreement, the territoriality principle is of vital importance in so far as succession in respect of State property is concerned (Article 18 of the 1983 Vienna Convention and Article 16 of the 2001 Resolution).

The obligation flowing from a pactum de negotiando, to negotiate with a view to concluding an agreement, must be fulfilled in good faith according to the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda. On 26 January 1972 the Arbitral Tribunal for the Agreement on German External Debts in the case of Greece v. the Federal Republic of Germany stated, in this regard, as follows.",
                "“62. ... However, a pactum de negotiando is also not without legal consequences. It means that both sides would make an effort, in good faith, to bring about a mutually satisfactory solution by way of a compromise, even if that meant the relinquishment of strongly held positions earlier taken. It implies a willingness for the purpose of negotiation to abandon earlier positions and to meet the other side part way. The language of the Agreement cannot be construed to mean that either side intends to adhere to its previous stand and to insist upon the complete capitulation of the other side. Such a concept would be inconsistent with the term ‘negotiation’. It would be the very opposite of what was intended. An undertaking to negotiate involves an understanding to deal with the other side with a view to coming to terms. Though the Tribunal does not conclude that Article 19 in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement, it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate, bargain, and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...",

This is true, even though the dispute extends not only to the amount of the claims but to their existence as well. The principle of settlement is not thereby affected. Article 19 does not necessarily require that the parties resolve the various legal questions on which they have disagreed. For example, it does not contemplate that both sides are expected to see eye to eye on certain points separating them, such as whether the disputed claims legally exist or not, or whether they are government or private claims. As to these points, the parties, in effect, have agreed to disagree but, notwithstanding their contentions with regard to them, they did commit themselves to pursue negotiations as far as possible with a view to concluding an agreement on a settlement.",

As enunciated by the International Court of Justice, it confirms and gives substance to the ordinary meaning of ‘negotiation’. To be meaningful, negotiations have to be entered into with a view to arriving at an agreement. Though, as we have pointed out, an agreement to negotiate does not necessarily imply an obligation to reach an agreement, it does imply that serious efforts towards that end will be made.”"

                "“The Court notes that the meaning of negotiations for the purposes of dispute settlement, or the obligation to negotiate, has been clarified through the jurisprudence of the Court and that of its predecessor, as well as arbitral awards. As the Permanent Court of International Justice already stated in 1931 in the case concerning Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, the obligation to negotiate is first of all ‘not only to enter into negotiations, but also to pursue them as far as possible, with a view to concluding agreements’. No doubt this does not imply ‘an obligation to reach an agreement’ ( Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68, para. 150), or that lengthy negotiations must be pursued of necessity ( Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 13). However, States must conduct themselves so that the ‘negotiations are meaningful’. This requirement is not satisfied, for example, where either of the parties ‘insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it’ ( North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 67, para. 146) or where they obstruct negotiations, for example, by interrupting communications or causing delays in an unjustified manner or disregarding the procedures agreed upon ( Lake Lanoux Arbitration (Spain/France) (1957), Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XII, p. 307). Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement also imply that the parties should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other ( Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 33, para. 78). As for the proof required for finding of the existence of bad faith (a circumstance which would justify either Party in claiming to be discharged from performance), ‘something more must appear than the failure of particular negotiations’ (Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol. II, p. 930). It could be provided by circumstantial evidence but should be supported ‘not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion’ (ibid.). ”",

The applicants and the banks under consideration had entered into civil-law contracts which entitled the applicants to withdraw their savings at any time, either from one of the branches or directly from the headquarters (pursuant to Yugoslav civil law, banks were liable for the debts of their branches). Admittedly, all foreign-currency deposits had been guaranteed by the SFRY, but the guarantee had never been activated as the banks under consideration had remained solvent until the dissolution of the SFRY. Liability had thus not shifted from the banks to the SFRY. Accordingly, the question at stake regarding the applicants’ savings was not a succession issue. They were of the opinion that the Slovenian and Serbian Governments should be held responsible for the debts of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka respectively, since they were responsible for those banks’ inability to service their debts. Notably, the Slovenian government had, by virtue of law, transferred most of the assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana to a new bank (see paragraph 49 above); the Serbian government had written off the debts of State-owned companies to Investbanka in order to be able to privatise them and gain millions in profit."

In this connection, the Croatian Government provided a copy of a report issued by Moody’s in 1997 showing that the assets of Nova Ljubljanska Banka, which had been founded with assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana only a couple of years earlier (see paragraph 49 above), were around USD 3.7 billion."

The mere fact that a State was the owner of a company, and in that sense controlled it, was not sufficient to attribute its activities to the State or to hold the State liable for the company’s debts pursuant to customary international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts."

While, initially at least, the freezing of the bank accounts could be viewed as intended to control the use of their possessions in the sense of the third rule, it may be questioned whether the fact that their deposits remained unavailable for such a long period did not amount to a “deprivation” in the sense of the second rule. However, bearing in mind the findings in paragraphs 77 to 81 above that the legislation of the respondent States did not extinguish the applicants’ claims or otherwise deprive them of legal validity, as well as those States’ acceptance in principle that deposit holders such as the applicants should also be able to dispose of their savings, it cannot be said that the applicants have been formally deprived of their savings. For the same reasons, the Court does not find that the subject matter could be regarded as clearly amounting to de facto expropriation. Against this background, and in view of the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in this case, the Court considers that the alleged violation of the right of property cannot be classified as falling into a precise category (see Beyeler v.

The domestic law and practice set out in paragraphs 44, 45, 49 and 51 above undoubtedly confirm that.

Nevertheless, domestic courts, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Slovenia, held that the impugned wartime entry in the companies register had always been unlawful (see paragraphs 30-35 and 51 above). It was thus deleted from the register. The Court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts in this regard. Indeed, the Court has held on many occasions that it is primarily for domestic courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic law so that the role of the Court is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v.

Having found that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka were and still are liable for “old” foreign-currency savings in their Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches, it must be examined, as the Chamber did, whether Slovenia and Serbia were responsible for the failure of those banks to repay their debt to the applicants. In this regard, the Court reiterates that a State may be responsible for debts of a State-owned company, even if the company is a separate legal entity, provided that it does not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Mykhaylenky and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 35091/02, 35196/02, 35201/02, 35204/02, 35945/02, 35949/02, 35953/02, 36800/02, 38296/02 and 42814/02, §§ 43-46, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII; Cooperativa Agricola Slobozia-Hanesei v.

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company’s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control)."

Russia (dec.), no. 25867/02, 31 May 2007, and Khachatryan v. Armenia, no. 31761/04, §§ 51-55, 1 December 2009). Lastly, as to the companies under the regime of social ownership, which was widely used in the SFRY and is still used in Serbia, the Court has held that they do not, in general, enjoy “sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State” to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, R.

In this regard, the Court notes that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana is State-owned by Slovenia and controlled by a Slovenian government agency – the Succession Fund (see paragraph 49 above). It is moreover crucial that by virtue of an amendment to the 1991 Constitutional Act, Slovenia transferred most of that bank’s assets to a new bank, to the detriment of the bank and its stakeholders (ibid.). The State thus disposed of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana’s assets as it saw fit (compare Khachatryan, cited above, § 51). The Grand Chamber therefore agrees with and endorses the Chamber’s finding that there are sufficient grounds to deem Slovenia responsible for Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana’s debt to Ms Ališić and Mr Sadžak. In this connection, the Court also notes the existence of certain evidence in the case indicating that most of the funds of the Sarajevo branch of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana ended up in Slovenia (see paragraph 18 above)."

Like Slovenia in respect of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, Serbia thus disposed of Investbanka’s assets as it considered necessary.

The Court considers the present case to be special for the following reasons. Firstly, when the applicants deposited their money, the SFRY still existed and the branches in question were not foreign branches. Moreover, Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana was State-owned even before its rehabilitation. Indeed, both that bank and Investbanka have always been either State-owned or socially-owned. The present case is thus evidently different from a standard case of rehabilitation of an insolvent private bank. The EFTA Court’s judgment on which the Slovenian Government relied is of little relevance in the present case as it concerned the rehabilitation of a failed private bank in the particular legal framework applicable to Iceland. Moreover, the savers in issue, unlike the present applicants, had already been repaid by the Dutch and United Kingdom authorities (see paragraphs 71-73 above)."

The Court held that given the dire reality of the Serbian economy at the material time and the margin of appreciation afforded to the States in respect of matters involving economic policy, the impugned provisions had struck a fair balance between the general interest and the applicant’s rights.

The explanation of the Serbian and Slovenian Governments for the delay is essentially that the international law on State succession required only that succession issues be negotiated in good faith, without imposing any time-limits for the settlement of such issues. They further argued that their insistence on the responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina for “old” foreign-currency savings in Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches of Slovenian and Serbian banks during succession negotiations was fully in line with the main principle of international law on State succession – the territoriality principle."

Despite that, the Croatian and Macedonian Governments have never abandoned their position that Slovenia should eventually be held liable and have continued to claim compensation for the amounts paid at the inter-State level (notably, in the context of succession negotiations). At the same time, the Slovenian government has repaid the total amount of “old” foreign-currency savings in domestic branches of Investbanka and other foreign banks (see paragraph 48 above) and the Serbian government has agreed to repay the “old” foreign-currency savings in foreign branches of Serbian banks (such as the Tuzla branch of Investbanka) of those who had the citizenship of any State other than the successor States of the SFRY (see paragraph 45 above).

Although the scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła v.

Furthermore, any and all verification decisions must be subject to judicial review."

While there is no doubt that the inability to dispose freely of their “old” foreign-currency savings for more than twenty years has caused some distress and frustration to all persons affected, the Court does not find it necessary, at present, to indicate as a general measure that they should all be provided with adequate redress for that damage by Serbia and Slovenia. If, however, either of those States fails to apply the measures indicated in paragraph 146 above and thus continues to violate the Convention, the Court may reconsider the issue of redress in an appropriate future case concerning this matter against the State in question (see Suljagić, cited above, § 64)."

The Grand Chamber, like the Chamber, accepts that the applicants’ inability to dispose freely of their “old” foreign-currency savings for more than twenty years must have caused them some distress and frustration. Their distress and frustration have inevitably been exacerbated by their taking upon themselves the trouble and burden of acting – at least to some extent – on behalf of all others in their position (see Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, § 248, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII). Therefore, making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the amounts claimed (that is, EUR 4,000 each to Ms Ališić and Mr Sadžak, to be paid by Slovenia, and EUR 4,000 to Mr Šahdanović, to be paid by Serbia)."

According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. That is, the applicant must have paid them, or be bound to pay them, pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation, and they must have been unavoidable in order to prevent the violation found or to obtain redress. The Court requires itemised bills and invoices that are sufficiently detailed to enable it to determine to what extent the above requirements have been met.
