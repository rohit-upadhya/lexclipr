However, the Court accepts that stricter requirements may be imposed on the eligibility to stand for election to parliament, as distinguished from voting eligibility (see the Venice Commission ’ s election guidelines, paragraph 2 9 above). Hence the Court would not preclude outright a five- year continuous residency requirement for potential parliamentary candidates. Arguably, this requirement may be deemed appropriate to enable such persons to acquire sufficient knowledge of the issues associated with the national parliament ’ s tasks."

For him the residence requirement was clearly proved by the propiska stamp in the internal passport of a Ukrainian citizen. The propiska indicated his permanent, official address in Ukraine and, accordingly, he had put that information in his candidacy application. He referred to other administrative procedures where information about the propiska was required and was taken as the “place of residence” ( see paragraphs 40-4 2 above). The propiska was an integral, fundamental aspect of the Ukrainian administrative system and constituted the principal basis upon which residency was determined for all official purposes. The Law on elections only referred to “residence” in Ukraine, whereas the Central Electoral Commission, in dismissing his candidacy, employed various terms, such as “permanently resident in Ukraine ” or “his habitual place of residence”, terms which did not feature in the text of that Law.

He had not been living in Ukraine for the previous five years, as required by section 8 of the Law on elections.

The Preamble goes on to affirm that European countries have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law.

Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them out in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for “implied limitations” (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, p. 23, § 52). In their internal legal orders the Contracting States may make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate."

As to the constitutional rules on the status of members of parliament, including criteria for declaring them ineligible, although they have a common origin in the need to ensure both the independence of elected representatives and the freedom of electors, these criteria vary according to the historical and political factors specific to each State. The multiplicity of situations provided for in the constitutions and electoral legislation of numerous member States of the Council of Europe shows the diversity of possible approaches in this area. For the purposes of applying Article 3, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another. However, the State ’ s margin of appreciation in this regard is limited by the obligation to respect the fundamental principle of Article 3, namely “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, pp. 23-24, § 54, and Podkolzina v.

Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI). The Court considers that a residence requirement for voting may be justified on the following grounds: (1) the assumption that a non-resident citizen is less directly or continuously concerned with, and has less knowledge of, a country ’ s day-to-day problems; (2) the impracticality and sometimes undesirability (in some cases impossibility) of parliamentary candidates presenting the different electoral issues to citizens living abroad so as to secure the free expression of opinion; (3) the influence of resident citizens on the selection of candidates and on the formulation of their electoral programmes; and (4) the correlation between one ’ s right to vote in parliamentary elections and being directly affected by the acts of the political bodies so elected ( see Polacco and Garofalo v.

France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic system, would be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment.

The Court considers that neither the relevant legislation nor practice contained a direct eligibility requirement of “ habitual ” or “continuous” residence in the territory of Ukraine. Furthermore, no distinction was made in the law between “ official ” and “habitual” residence.

Although they have a common origin in the need to ensure both the independence of elected representatives and the freedom of electors, these requirements vary in accordance with the historical and political factors specific to each State. The multiplicity of situations provided for in the constitutions and electoral legislation of numerous member States of the Council of Europe shows the diversity of possible approaches in this area. For the purposes of Article 3, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another ( see Podkolzina v.

France (no. 11123/84, Commission decision of 9 December 1987, Decisions and Reports ( DR ) 54, p. 52), the Commission examined a complaint by Green Party activists that their electoral list was discriminated against during elections to the European Parliament by the French legislative provision setting a 5% threshold of votes cast for obtaining a refund of the 100,000 French francs (FRF) deposit. The Commission dismissed this complaint as manifestly ill-founded. It considered that the measure pursued the legitimate aim of encouraging the development of sufficiently representative political movements and, bearing in mind the State ’ s margin of appreciation, was not unreasonable or disproportionate. In a more recent decision in André v. France ( no. 27759/95, Commission decision of 18 October 1995, unreported ), the Commission, referring to its findings in Tête, dismissed the application in question, which had attempted to challenge the deposit restriction on the ground that candidates from a list of disadvantaged people (unemployed persons, vagrants and invalids) could not afford to pay the required amount."

Thus, in Matthews and Aziz, the applicants ( as a resident of Gibraltar and a member of the Turkish-Cypriot community living in the government-controlled area of Cyprus respectively ) had no right to vote in the elections to the European Parliament or the Cypriot House of Representatives due to legislative lacunae ( see Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 64, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, and Aziz v.

The Constitutional Court examined the basis for the deposit, which was intended to encourage a responsible attitude towards elections on the part of potential candidates and to prevent an abuse of electoral rights. It held that this restriction was neither unconstitutional nor discriminatory, since it did not predetermine the citizen ’ s right to vote or stand for election but served exclusively as a precondition for the candidate ’ s registration and was applied in a similar manner to all persons seeking to register as candidates. Moreover, quite apart from the electoral issues, other constitutionally valid concerns, such as the need to prevent excessive or unreasonable expenditure from the State budget, served as justification for the measure in question."

The Court is satisfied that the electoral deposit system adopted at the material time by the Ukrainian political institutions was an acceptable compromise between these competing interests and, following its enactment, remained the subject of careful consideration by the domestic legislature and judiciary in the light of modern - day conditions (compare and contrast Hirst, cited above, §§ 79 ‑ 80)."

Moreover, as observed above, the Court has stated on many occasions that States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in the field of electoral legislation, so that even a system which fixes a relatively high threshold, for example, as regards the number of signatures required to stand for election or a minimum percentage of votes cast nationally to qualify for a local seat, may be deemed compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 ( see Federación Nacionalista Canaria v.

One system might concentrate more on a fair representation of the parties in Parliament, while another one might aim to avoid a fragmentation of the party system and encourage the formation of a governing majority of one party in Parliament (see paragraph 55 above). None of these aims can be considered unreasonable in itself. Moreover, the role played by thresholds varies in accordance with the level at which they are set and the party system in each country.

Paragraph 6 of Article 67, as amended, provides that electoral laws must be framed in such a way as to strike a balance between the principles of ‘ fair representation ’ and ‘ governmental stability ’. The aim is to ensure that the electors ’ will is reflected as far as possible [in] the legislature. ...

The principle of ‘ fair representation ’ with which the Constitution requires [compliance] consists in free, equal, secret and universal [suffrage], with one round of voting and public access to the counting of votes and the recording of results, and produces a number of representatives proportional to the number of votes obtained. The principle of ‘ governmental stability ’ is perceived as a reference to methods designed to reflect votes [within] the legislature so as to guarantee the strength of the executive power. The ‘ governmental stability ’ which it is sought to ensure through the threshold (described as a ‘ hurdle ’ ), just like ‘ fair representation ’ ..., is protected by the Constitution.

The fact that the new Parliament elected on 22 July 2007 is far more representative than the outgoing Parliament, representing about 90 % of the opinions of the electorate, is due to the fact that three instead of two parties are represented and to the ploy of opposition parties to launch party-sponsored independent candidates and not to any steps taken by the Turkish authorities themselves."

Although there is no uniform classification of types of ballot and electoral systems, it is usual to distinguish three main types: majority vote systems, proportional systems and mixed systems. In majority vote systems, the winner is the candidate or list of candidates obtaining the majority of the votes in the decisive round of voting. This type of ballot makes it possible to vote in governments with clear parliamentary majorities, but at the same time it militates against the representation of minority political parties. Thus, for example, in the United Kingdom the use over many decades of a single round of voting in a single-member majority vote system (“first past the post”), combined with the existence of two dominant political parties, has had the effect of giving few seats to other parties in relation to the number of votes that they obtain. There are other similar cases, in France for instance, where there is a majority vote system spread over two rounds of voting. At the opposite extreme, the aim of the proportional representation system is to ensure that the votes cast are reflected in a proportional number of seats. Proportional representation is generally considered to be the fairest system because it tends to reflect more closely the various political forces. However, the disadvantage of proportional representation is that it tends to lead to fragmentation among those seeking electoral support and thus makes it more difficult to establish stable parliamentary majorities."

By way of example, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey have opted for one or other variant of proportional representation. There are also mixed systems containing various combinations of the two types of ballot (in Germany, Italy and Lithuania, for example)."

These thresholds, generally expressed as a percentage of the votes cast, are “limits, fixed or variable, defined in terms of the electoral result, which determine the share of a list or candidate in the distribution of seats”. However, the role played by thresholds varies in accordance with the level at which they are set and the party system in each country. A low threshold excludes only very small groupings, which makes it more difficult to form stable majorities, whereas in cases where the party system is highly fragmented a high threshold deprives many voters of representation."

Analysis of the electoral thresholds adopted in the member States which have proportional representation shows that only four States have opted for high thresholds: Turkey has the highest, at 10%; Liechtenstein has an 8% threshold; and the Russian Federation and Georgia a 7% one. A third of the States impose a 5% threshold and thirteen of them have chosen a lower figure. The other member States (seven in number) do not use thresholds. Moreover, in several systems the thresholds are applied only to a restricted number of seats (in Norway and Iceland, for example). Thresholds for parties and thresholds for coalitions may be set at different levels. In the Czech Republic, for example, the threshold for one party is 5%, whereas in the case of a coalition it is raised by 5% for each of the constituent parties. In Poland, the threshold for coalitions is 8% whatever the number of constituent parties. There are similar variations among the thresholds for independent candidates: in Moldova, for example, the relevant threshold is 3%.",

In most countries which had introduced a threshold, the level chosen was 5% (in 2001 the average was 4.25% in central and eastern Europe ). Even countries which were experiencing serious problems regarding integration and which needed to stabilise party representation, in view of the existence of independent or very small parties, had not seen fit to impose thresholds twice as high.

The impossibility for independent candidates to make electoral broadcasts, although all political parties had an express entitlement to air time on television and radio, was also a serious disadvantage (see paragraph 38 above).

If that principle was applied, it was obvious that the impossibility for DEHAP to enter Parliament when it had obtained more than 45% (about 2,000,000 ) of the votes cast in south-eastern Turkey significantly distorted representation. In addition, the obligation to operate at national level was to be seen in the context of a political culture which systematically ignored debate about “the Kurdish question”, manifestly blocking the free expression of the will of a large proportion of the people of south-eastern Turkey, in breach of the Court ’ s settled case-law.

The members of the DTP – the party which, according to the applicants, had taken the place of the one they were members of – had stood as independent candidates in the 2007 elections and had been elected easily because as independents they were not subject to the national threshold. A few days after their election they had rejoined the DTP and formed a parliamentary group ( see paragraph 25 above). Having decided that it could not cross the threshold in the 2007 elections, the DTP had urged its members to stand as independent candidates and had managed to obtain twenty seats in Parliament. It was important to note that the total number of votes obtained by the DTP ’ s independent candidates represented only 2.04% of the national vote, which meant that the DTP would not even have been able to reach the 5% threshold which, according to the applicants, was the expression of a “common democratic political tradition” among European countries. If the threshold had been lower – say 2% – the DTP, with 2.04% of the votes cast, would have won only one seat, or two at the most. By winning twenty seats, or 3.6% of the total number of seats in the Grand National Assembly, the DTP had managed to raise its representation in Parliament to the maximum."

Before the 2007 elections, therefore, it had collaborated with the CHP, its rival, managing in that way to obtain thirteen seats on that party ’ s lists.

For example, to be elected in the first Istanbul constituency a candidate had to obtain about 111,750 votes, whereas in Hakkari province (south-eastern Turkey ) 34,000 were needed.

On account of the threshold it was absolutely impossible for a party operating on a regional basis to be represented in Parliament. In Turkey that meant more precisely that none of the Kurdish parties could enter Parliament even though in their own regions these parties regularly achieved scores comparable with that reached by the applicants in 2002 ( over 45% of the votes cast). It was clear that all the measures taken by the Government, centring on the 10% threshold, were the result of a deliberate policy of exclusion.

Democracy constitutes a fundamental element of the “European public order”, and the rights guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (see, most recently and among many other authorities, Ždanoka v.

The “free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” is a matter on which Article 11 of the Convention also has a bearing, guaranteeing as it does freedom of association, and thus indirectly the freedom of political parties, which represent a form of association essential to the proper functioning of democracy. Expression of the opinion of the people is inconceivable without the assistance of a plurality of political parties representing the currents of opinion flowing through a country ’ s population. By reflecting those currents, not only within political institutions but also, thanks to the media, at all levels of life in society, they make an irreplaceable contribution to the political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (see Lingens, cited above, § 42; Castells v.

Accordingly no form of compulsion must be brought to bear on voters as regards their choice of candidates or parties.

                "109. As regards the general interpretation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has set out in its case-law the following main principles (see, among other authorities, Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, §§ 46 ‑ 51; Ždanoka, cited above, § 115; Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 33, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; and Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 61, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX):",
                "( i ) Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 seems at first sight different from the other provisions of the Convention and its Protocols which guarantee rights, as it is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Parties to hold elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom. However, having regard to the travaux préparatoires of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the way the provision has been interpreted in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and the right to stand for election (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above).",
                "(ii) The rights enshrined in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are not absolute. There is room for “implied limitations”, and Contracting States must be given a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere (see, among other authorities, Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 63, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 201, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV).",
                "(iii) The concept of “implied limitations” under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by the restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision. Given that Article 3 is not limited by a specific list of “legitimate aims” such as those enumerated in Articles 8 to 11, the Contracting States are therefore free to rely on an aim not contained in that list to justify a restriction, provided that the compatibility of that aim with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention is proved in the particular circumstances of a case. It also means that the Court does not apply the traditional tests of “necessity” or “pressing social need” which are used in the context of Articles 8 to 11. In examining compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has focused mainly on two criteria: whether there has been arbitrariness or a lack of proportionality, and whether the restriction has interfered with the free expression of the opinion of the people.",
                "(iv) However, it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. It has to satisfy itself that limitations do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence, and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52). In particular, any such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature – in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, § 62; Hilbe v. Liechtenstein ( dec. ), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; and Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, § 56, ECHR 2004 ‑ X). Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws which it promulgates (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, § 62).",
                "(v) As regards the right to stand as a candidate for election, that is, the so ‑ called “passive” aspect of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has been even more cautious in its assessment of restrictions in that context than when it has been called upon to examine restrictions on the right to vote, that is, the so-called “active” element of the rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In Melnychenko (cited above, § 57 ), the Court observed that stricter requirements may be imposed on eligibility to stand for election to Parliament than is the case for eligibility to vote. On that point, it took the view that, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (ibid. § 59; see also, mutatis mutandis, Podkolzina, cited above, § 35 ).",
                "(vi) Similarly, the Court has held that, once the wishes of the people have been freely and democratically expressed, no subsequent amendment to the organisation of the electoral system may call that choice into question, except in the presence of compelling grounds for the democratic order (see Lykourezos v. Greece, no. 33554/03, § 52, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII).",

In that regard, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 goes no further than prescribing “free” elections held at “reasonable intervals” “by secret ballot” and “under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people”. Subject to that reservation, it does not create any “obligation to introduce a specific system” such as proportional representation or majority voting with one or two ballots (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54)."

Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not imply that all votes must necessarily have equal weight as regards the outcome of the election or that all candidates must have equal chances of victory.

The Court observes that electoral thresholds are not unknown among European electoral systems and that there are different kinds which vary according to the type of election and the context within which they are used. Analysis of the electoral thresholds adopted in the member States shows that, apart from Turkey, only three States have opted for high thresholds. Liechtenstein has fixed the level at 8%, and the Russian Federation and Georgia at 7%. A third of the States impose a 5% threshold and thirteen of them have chosen a lower figure. The other States which have a proportional representation system do not use thresholds. Thresholds also vary according to whether they apply to a party or a coalition, and some countries have adopted thresholds for independent candidates (see paragraphs 61 ‑ 64 above)."

In its Resolution of 18 April 2007, in which it stressed the indissoluble link between the representativeness of democracy and thresholds, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe pointed out that “in well-established democracies, there should be no thresholds higher than 3% during the parliamentary elections”. That opinion was reiterated in the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Recommendation 1791 (2007) (see paragraphs 52 - 53 above). In addition, in texts concerning Turkey, namely the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Resolutions 1380 (2004) and 1547 (2007) and the Report on observation of the Parliamentary elections in Turkey (22 July 2007), produced by an ad hoc Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly, the organs of the Council of Europe urged Turkey, among other recommendations, to amend its electoral code to lower the 10% threshold (see paragraphs 58 - 59 above)."

One system might concentrate more on a fair representation of the parties in Parliament, while another one might aim to avoid a fragmentation of the party system and encourage the formation of a governing majority of one party in Parliament (see paragraph 55 above). None of these aims can be considered unreasonable in itself. Moreover, the role played by thresholds varies in accordance with the level at which they are set and the party system in each country. A low threshold excludes only very small groupings, which makes it more difficult to form stable majorities, whereas in cases where the party system is highly fragmented a high threshold deprives many voters of representation (see paragraphs 58- 59 above)."

However, it has already been pointed out that any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another, at least so long as the chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the “free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see, among other authorities, Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54).

They act as both an instrument which citizens can use to participate in electoral debate and a tribune through which they can express their support for various political programmes (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, § 25). They can thus be distinguished from other political actors such as independent candidates, who in general are locally based. Similarly, the Court notes that in Turkey independent candidates are subject to a number of unfavourable restrictions and conditions not applicable to political parties. They must deposit a guarantee, their names are not printed on the ballot slips supplied to frontier posts and large airports, and they are not able to broadcast electoral messages whereas all political parties have an express entitlement to air time on television and radio (see paragraphs 35 and 38 above)."

The fact that independents were not required to reach any threshold greatly facilitated the adoption of that electoral strategy, despite the restrictions listed above (see paragraphs 35 and 38 ).

The Court notes in that regard that section 16 of Law no. 2839 prevents parties from presenting joint lists and from participating in parliamentary elections by forming perfectly legal coalitions. As the Government pointed out, political parties have developed an electoral strategy whereby they can circumvent this prohibition. Use of this strategy has produced tangible results, particularly in the 1991 and 2007 elections. Before the elections of 20 October 1991, two alliances were formed under the banner of two large political parties. By that means some small parties, including the HEP – DEHAP ’ s predecessor – managed to obtain eighteen seats in Parliament (see paragraph 15 above). The same electoral strategy bore fruit in the elections of 22 July 2007 (see paragraph 24 above)."

As the Chamber pointed out in paragraph 73 of its judgment, the fact that such a large part of the electorate was not ultimately represented in Parliament was hardly consistent with the crucial role played in a representative democracy by Parliament, which is the main instrument of democratic control and political responsibility, and must reflect as faithfully as possible the desire for a truly democratic political regime."

At the time when the 1961 Constitution was in force the Constitutional Court, grounding its decision on the principles of a democratic State and pluralism, rejected the idea of applying an “ordinary threshold” within each electoral constituency (see paragraph 40 above ). Later, after the adoption of the 1982 Constitution, when ruling on the question of electoral systems, the Constitutional Court held that the legislature did not have an unlimited margin of appreciation in the matter and could not adopt “measures tending to restrict the free expression of the opinion of the people, or subject political life to the hegemony of a political party, or destroy the multiparty system” (see paragraph 41 above)."

While accepting that thresholds restricted “the right to vote and to be elected”, the Constitutional Court held that they were acceptable provided that they did not exceed normal limits and accordingly ruled that the 10% threshold was compatible with constitutional principles. On the other hand, citing the principle of “fair representation”, it declared null and void an electoral threshold of 25% for the distribution of seats within provinces. It thus asserted that the constitutional principles of fair representation and governmental stability should necessarily be combined in such a way that they counterbalanced and complemented each other (see paragraph 43 above)."

It compels political parties to make use of stratagems which do not contribute to the transparency of the electoral process. In the present case, however, the Court is not persuaded that, when assessed in the light of the specific political context of the elections in question, and attended as it is by correctives and other guarantees which have limited its effects in practice, the threshold has had the effect of impairing in their essence the rights secured to the applicants by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1."

Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 33, Reports 1998-I; Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III; and Lykourezos v.

Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 35, ECHR 2002-II).

The two ConEC chairpersons were arrested and charged with forging election documents. ... The CEC forwarded materials on possible criminal violations to the Prosecutor General's Office regarding 29 PECs. ...",

The CEC decisions on the invalidation of the election results in the four constituencies concluded that there were “unacceptable modifications performed on the protocols and law infringements which made it impossible to determine the will of the voters” but did not provide any factual basis to support this conclusion. ...",

Invalidation of results in a polling station was premised solely on the conclusion of an individual CEC member as to whether a protocol should be invalidated. The judgment of a single CEC member that there were deficiencies in the protocol was accepted as established fact without any explanation of the alleged defect or identification of the number of votes involved. Accordingly, there was no factual basis presented publicly for invalidating results in any of the four constituencies, which is particularly troubling since the CEC registered few complaints that alleged violations in these constituencies. ...",

However, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, §§ 46-51, Series A no. 113). The Court has consistently highlighted the importance of the democratic principles underlying the interpretation and application of the Convention and has emphasised that the rights guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (ibid., § 47; see also Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 58, ECHR 2005-IX)."

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 201, ECHR 2000-IV). It is, however, for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. In particular, it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 52, and Gitonas and Others v. Greece, 1 July 1997, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV).

Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 33, Reports 1998-I; Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999-III; and Lykourezos v.

It is sufficiently clear from the material available in the case file that, according to the copies of PEC protocols obtained by the applicant from each of the polling stations at the end of election day (before the incidents of tampering with protocols took place), the applicant received a total of 5,566 votes against H.'s 3,992 votes. According to the ConEC protocol issued on the basis of those PEC protocols, after some of those protocols had been tampered with, the applicant received 5,350 votes against H.'s 4,091 votes. Thus, it is obvious that the election results, as they stood both before and after the irregularities involving illegal alterations to protocols, showed that the applicant was the clear winner of the elections. Moreover, neither the CEC nor the domestic courts hearing appeals against its decision, nor the Sumgayit City Court, dealing with the criminal case concerning the irregularities in question, ever found that any of the illegal alterations had been made to assist the applicant's cause. On the contrary, it was found by the Sumgayit City Court that they had been made exclusively in favour of her opponents. Neither did the Government, in their observations, argue that the irregularities had been intended to benefit the applicant. Accordingly, even despite the fact that these irregularities had been made in an attempt to inflate her opponents'vote counts and decrease her vote count, the election results still showed the applicant as a clear winner. In such circumstances, the Court finds it hard to understand the electoral authorities'and the Government's position that these irregularities had somehow made it “impossible to determine the will of the voters” in the entire constituency. On the contrary, the Court considers that the facts of the case clearly disclose a situation where the irregularities, however grave they might have been, did not impact the ultimate result of the election and failed to cast any doubt on the choice made by the majority of voters in the constituency."

Nevertheless, the Court finds alarming the CEC's failure to even consider the possibility of a recount before invalidating the election results. The Court considers that, in cases where illegal tampering with vote counting or election documents may affect the determination of the outcome of the elections, a fair procedure for recounting votes where such a recount is possible is an important safeguard of the fairness and success of the entire election process. Even accepting the Government's argument that under Azerbaijani law an election recount was optional ( at the CEC's discretion) and not mandatory, the Court considers that in the present case the CEC could have considered the possibility of a recount and at least explained the reasons for passing up this opportunity before deciding on an outright invalidation of the election results.

Firstly, as noted above, it was up to the CEC to explain the reasons for not ordering a recount and it failed to offer such reasons. Secondly, it appears that former Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code (see paragraph 29 above) concerned the determination of the validity of the ballots at the moment when they were taken out of the ballot boxes for the original count. Once a ballot was pulled out of its envelope, determined to be valid and counted during the original count, nothing could prevent the use of this ballot at any subsequent election recount. Thirdly, the Court generally finds that it is unacceptable to rely solely on such irrelevant and petty formalities in order to justify a failure to abide by statutorily-prescribed safeguards of the integrity of the electoral process."

Furthermore, having regard to the CEC decision of 8 November 2005, the Court notes that the CEC first invalidated the election results in sixteen polling stations owing to the alleged irregularities, and then proceeded to rely on Article 170.2.2 of the Electoral Code in order to invalidate the election results in the entire constituency based on the fact that the elections in two-fifths of the total number of polling stations representing more than one-quarter of the constituency electorate had been annulled. However, the Court finds it troubling that, upon invalidating the elections both in the relevant polling stations and in the entire constituency, the CEC ignored the requirements of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, which prohibited invalidation of election results at any level on the basis of a finding of irregularities committed for the benefit of candidates who lost the election (see paragraph 27 above). This rule protected the opinion of the electorate, as well as the interests of a candidate who received the highest number of votes and who was not responsible for any irregularities, from any unlawful actions attempted against such winning candidate. As such, this rule was aimed at preventing a situation where a winning candidate is wrongfully punished by being deprived of his or her victory in the election for malfeasance attributable to his or her losing opponents. In this connection, the Court notes that the situation envisaged in Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code is the direct opposite of a situation where irregularities are found to have been allegedly made to the benefit of the “winning” candidate (contrast Namat Aliyev, cited above, §§ 9-18, 64, 67 and 74). However, the Court observes that, despite the expressly stated requirement of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, neither the CEC, at the time of making its decision to annul the election, nor the domestic courts dealing with the appeals against its decision, made an attempt to determine in whose favour the alleged irregularities had been made. In any event, the subsequent criminal proceedings at the Sumgayit City Court established that all the illegal alterations to the PEC protocols had been made exclusively for the benefit of the applicant's opponents. Finally, as noted above, even despite these illegal alterations, the applicant still emerged as the candidate with the largest number of votes and it has never even been suggested by any of the domestic authorities that she could be responsible for any of the irregularities in question. In such circumstances, it is all but apparent that the decision to invalidate the election results in the applicant's constituency, and thus deprive her of the parliamentary seat, not only lacked any relevant substantiation but was also made in breach of the requirement of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code. At the very least, the failure to take this requirement into account, and the lack of any explanation for such failure, contributed to the appearance of arbitrariness of the annulment of the election."

Lastly, the Court notes that, despite the fact that the applicant repeatedly raised all of the above points in her appeals to the domestic courts, the courts failed to adequately address these issues and simply reiterated the CEC's findings. They refused to examine any primary evidence, which primarily consisted of the illegally altered originals of the PEC protocols, and failed to review the compliance of the CEC's decision with the requirements of the electoral law. As such, the manner of examination of the applicant's election-related appeals was ineffective."

By arbitrarily invalidating the election results because of these officials'actions, the domestic authorities essentially aided and abetted them in thwarting the election. Such lack of concern for integrity of the electoral process from within the electoral administration cannot be considered compatible with the spirit of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

In view of the above, the Court concludes that, while the perpetrators of the irregularities, which ostensibly “necessitated” the authorities'decision to invalidate the election results, did not appear to succeed in their aim of affecting the ultimate outcome of the elections, the invalidation decision itself “succeeded” in doing so. The annulment of the elections in the applicant's constituency lacked any relevant reasons and was in apparent breach of the procedure established by the domestic electoral law (see paragraph 51 above). This decision arbitrarily infringed the applicant's electoral rights by depriving her of the benefit of being elected to Parliament, and as such ran counter to the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage."

The Court considers that, had the applicant become a member of parliament, she could have been expected to serve at least part of her tenure and received certain income from her service. Accordingly, she suffered certain pecuniary damage, although this damage cannot be technically quantified in terms of monthly salaries for the entire term of service of a member of parliament.
