It is true that in some decisions, adopted before the Regner judgment, the Court had excluded the applicability of Article 6 to procedures concerning a call for tenders by the domestic authorities, pointing out that the latter enjoyed a discretionary power and that the substantive law of the State concerned did not confer to the applicants a right to be awarded the tender (see, in particular, Marti AG and Others v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 36308/97, ECHR 2000 VIII; SKYRADIO AG and Others v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 46841/99, 31 August 2004; I.T.C. LTD v. Malta (dec.), no. 2629/06, 11 December 2007; and S.C.

However, the Court considers the principles stated in Regner to be relevant for the present case, where the applicant institute clearly enjoyed a procedural right to the lawful and correct adjudication of the tenders. Should the tender be awarded to the applicant institute, the latter would have been conferred a civil right. In this connection, it is to be recalled that there has been a shift in Court’s case-law towards applying the civil limb of Article 6 to cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private right belonging to an individual (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 151, ECHR 2017 (extracts))."

The Ministry pointed out that it was presumed that no conflict of interests existed, even when evaluators worked in the same institution whose tenders they were evaluating and that this was a common European practice.

It further urged the Administrative Court to decide that it would be awarded funding. It complained that the Ministry had joined the proceedings that had initially been intended for consideration of tenders from private research organisations to the proceedings for consideration of tenders from public research organisations, without issuing a formal decision to that effect. It also complained of errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes, because not all of the criteria specified in the Rules on Quality Assessment and Funding of the Public Research Organisation Programme had been taken into account. It argued, inter alia, that the evaluation procedure had been unfair because some of the evaluators had been biased, as they had been evaluating research programmes which were competing with the very programmes in which they themselves participated. This provoked a distortion of the results of the procedure, as shown by the fact that only those research programmes in which the evaluators were leaders or members of research teams obtained financing. The applicant institute expressly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard with regard to the alleged procedural errors in the evaluation of the programmes. Additionally, it submitted a letter of 2 December 2003 which one of the witnesses, K., had sent to the Minister of Education, Science and Sport and several other addressees. In the letter K. notified them of problems he had detected in the tender proceedings in which he had participated as an evaluator."

The reasons for the decision were given on a single page. Invoking section 71(2) of the Administrative Dispute Act ( Zakon o upravnem sporu – hereinafter “the ADA”, see paragraph 23 below), the Administrative Court chiefly referred to the submissions of the Ministry. It considered, among other things, that the Ministry had not acted unlawfully in joining the proceedings. It accepted the Ministry’s submission that its decision had been dictated by the nature of the research and infrastructural programmes, taking into account the guidelines of the National Research and Development Programme. The court also pointed out that the procedural rules for the evaluation of research programmes adopted by the National Scientific and Research Council clearly defined the stages of the evaluation procedure, the participants in it and their tasks. Regarding the alleged conflict of interests, the court stated that it agreed with the Ministry as to why no such conflict existed and cited section 71(2) of the ADA (see paragraph 23 below).

Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, § 47, ECHR 2002-V, with further references).

This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin Şimşek v. Turkey, no. 5488/05, § 28, 28 February 2012, and Szücs v. Austria, 24 November 1997, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII)."

Article 91 § 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland provides clearly and beyond any doubt: ‘If an agreement, ratified by the Republic of Poland, establishing an international organisation so provides, the laws established by it shall be applied directly and have precedence in the event of a conflict of laws.’ Furthermore, the examination of how the applicable provisions governing the functioning of the Council and its practice in the performance of functions under the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and provisions of national law influence the fulfilment of the requirements of independence and impartiality under Union law by a court formed with the participation of the Council represents a typical judicial examination of certain facts and provisions of law. It should be recalled once again that such examination is completely unrelated to the jurisdiction vested in the Constitutional Court by the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and the Act on the Constitutional Court.”"

                "“40. [As regards the circumstances under which the Council was established], one should bear in mind the shortened term of the previous Council (a constitutional body pursuant to Article 187 § 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland): Article 6 of the [2017 Amending Act]. As intended by the legislature, the new provisions were to ensure conformity with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland in connection with the Constitutional Court judgment of 20 June 2017 (K 5/17...), pursuant to which section 11(2-4) and section 13(3) of the NCJ Act are in breach of the Constitution to the extent that they provide for the individual term of office for Council members who are judges. To that end, the Supreme Court concludes that the referenced Constitutional Court ‘judgment’ was issued with the participation of judges elected in breach of Article 190 § 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, as ascertained under the following judgments of that court: 16 December 2015, K 34/15 ...; 9 March 2016, K 47/15 ...; 11 August 2016, K 39/16 ...”"

                "“43. The mechanism for electing NCJ members was considerably modified pursuant to [the 2017 Amending Act]. Pursuant to section 1(1), Sejm shall elect fifteen Council members for a joint four-year term of office from among judges of the Supreme Court, ordinary courts, administrative courts, and military courts. When making its choice, Sejm shall – to the extent possible – recognise the need for judges of diverse types and levels of court to be represented on the Council. Notably, the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland have not been amended in respect of NCJ membership or NCJ member appointment. This means that a statute could only lawfully amend the manner of election of Council members (judges) by judges rather than introducing a procedure whereby NCJ judicial members are elected by the legislature. The aforementioned amendment to the NCJ Act passed jointly with the new Act on the Supreme Court provides a solution whereby the legislature and the executive – regardless of the long statutory tradition of a part of the Council members being elected by judges themselves, thus reflecting the Council’s status and mandate, and those of the judiciary recognised as a power separate from other authorities under the Constitution of the Republic of Poland – gain a nearly monopolistic position in deciding on NCJ membership. Today, the legislature is responsible for electing 15 members of the NCJ who are judges, with another 6 NCJ members being parliamentary representatives (4 and 2 of whom are elected by Sejm and the Senate, respectively). The new mechanism of electing NCJ members who are judges has resulted in the decision to appoint as many as twenty-one of the twenty-five (84%) of Council members lying with both parliamentary houses. Furthermore, the Minister of Justice and a representative of the President of the Republic of Poland are ex officio Council members: consequently, twenty-three of the twenty-five Council members are ultimately appointed by authorities other than the judiciary. This is how the division and balance of the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches have been distorted, while having been duly described under Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland as a foundation of a democratic state of law model (Article 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland).",
                "44. Since Sejm and the Senate are responsible for electing from among their respective members, judges representing various levels shall elect Council members from among individuals applying as candidates. In consequence, the checks and balances rule anchored in Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland will also be adhered to, in support of the process of rationalising the parliamentary governance system.”"

                "“45. The Supreme Court’s appraisal in acting on the binding legal interpretation expressed in the CJEU’s judgment of 19 November 2019 attaches considerable importance to the process of electing present-day Council members. With regard to this particular matter, the point at issue concerns the endorsement lists that were apparently offered to candidates by judges. To date, it has not been verified whether new Council members were lawfully nominated as candidates, or who endorsed them. Relevant documents have not been disclosed yet, despite the relevant judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of 28 June 2019, OSK 4282/18 ... It is common knowledge that the enforcement of the judgment has faced an obstacle in a decision issued by the Chair of the Personal Data Protection Authority on 29 July 2019 on the initiative of a new NCJ member. Consequently, it has come to pass that a body of the judiciary responsible for a review of administrative authorities has in effect itself fallen under the review of the latter. The failure to implement the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment justifies an assumption that the content of the lists of endorsement for individual judicial candidates for the NCJ corroborates the dependence of candidates on the legislature or the executive.",
                "46. The Supreme Court further concludes that it is common knowledge that the public had been informed of judicial candidates to the Council having been recommended by presidents of district courts appointed by the Minister of Justice; other judges were recommended by judges dependent on (reporting to) candidates in managerial positions in courts of higher instance; judicial Council candidates were also recommended by the plenipotentiary of the Institute of the Judiciary at the Ministry of Justice; last but not least, some candidatures were submitted by the next of kin; candidates recommended other candidates; some of the elected members of the future Council were Ministry of Justice employees. All these facts prove that the executive branch – acting through its direct or indirect subordinates – had stood behind the majority of recommendations for NCJ judicial member candidatures. Such circumstances accompanying the process of electing current Council members may well raise doubts among the general public as to the Council’s independence from the executive.",

The fourth test component is the important assessment of how the body performs its constitutional duty to safeguard the independence of courts and judges; and how it performs its competencies, and in particular whether it proceeds in a manner that could render its independence from the legislature and the executive doubtful from the vantage point of a member of the public. With regard to the aforementioned premises, the following arguments ought to be raised: the National Council of the Judiciary failed to take action in defence of the independence of the Supreme Court or of the Court’s judges after the coming into force of the Act on the Supreme Court and an attempt to force the Court’s judges into retirement (see the CJEU’s judgment of 24 June 2019, C-619/18).",

In this area, previously, the ordinary courts and the Labour, Social Security, and Public Affairs Chamber (now the Labour and Social Security Chamber) were competent.

Selecting only such candidates as judges of the Supreme Court does not guarantee their independence and thus does not allow for the constitution of an independent court. Among the elected members of the Disciplinary Chamber are: the director of a department in the State Prosecutor’s Office; a deputy regional prosecutor in the Regional Prosecutor’s Office (appointment in 2016); the director of the legislative office of the National Institute of Remembrance (IPN); the prosecutor of the State Prosecutor’s Office, who accused judges of corruption but ultimately the proceedings in this case were discontinued; the former governor and adviser to the Speaker of Sejm; a person known in the legal community exclusively for his activity in the mass media and social media, who in recent times has repeatedly expressed his unequivocal political sympathies; a prosecutor whose procedural actions were found to have violated Article 3 of the Convention (prohibition of torture) as a result of a settlement before the Court (application no. 32420/07).”"

Such documents may be crucial when there are more candidates for a judicial post than places. This was the case for candidates to the Disciplinary Chamber, where over 90 candidates applied for sixteen seats. ... the amendment further introduced the principle that if resolutions in individual cases concerning appointment to the Supreme Court are not challenged by all participants to the proceedings, it becomes final in the part concerning the decision to present a motion for appointment to the office of judge of the Supreme Court. This type of solution eliminates the possibility of an effective appeal of a candidate against a resolution of the NCJ to the relevant court ...",

The National Council of the Judiciary has been dominated by politically elected members of the parliamentary majority. After the selection by Sejm of fifteen judges as members of the National Council of the Judiciary, as many as twenty-one of the twenty-five persons comprising the Council come from the political nomination of both chambers of Parliament. As a result of the election of judges to the National Council of the Judiciary, the judges sitting on that body ceased to be a group representing judges of the Supreme Court, ordinary courts, administrative courts and military courts, as provided by Article 187 § 1 (2) of the Constitution. The judges sitting on it as a result of political nomination were not therefore given a mandate to represent the judiciary, a task which should be entrusted to persons enjoying authority and independence from political influence. This has resulted in a fundamental weakening of the role of the National Council of the Judiciary as a guardian of the independence of courts and judges.”"

That was a reaction to the behaviour of judicial self-government bodies which refused to exercise their powers in defective proceedings before the [NCJ]. Instead of eliminating the broadly criticised defects of the system it had devised, the legislature decided to eliminate from the system the last options of participation in the procedure of judicial appointments previously left for judicial self-government bodies.",

Persons named in the lists of recommendations drawn up in a defective procedure of appointment for judicial positions cannot be considered to have been candidates for office duly presented to the President of the Republic of Poland whom the President is competent to appoint to the office.

The procedure for appointment to the office of judge has a particular bearing on whether the court comprised of such appointees may be considered an impartial and independent tribunal in a given case. Any criteria of appointment other than substantive ones would suggest that the judge is affiliated with a political option or group. The more political the appointment procedure, i.e., the more the appointment decision comes directly from politicians or representatives of political authorities, the less transparent and more arbitrary, or even unlawful, the decision-making procedure will be. That seriously, and irreversibly, undermines the trust of the general public in a judge as an independent person free of external influence and pressure or the willingness to show gratitude to such groups.",
                "Consequently, individual judges in the system of the judiciary could become permanently identified with specific political groups or groups of interest (‘our judges’ v. ‘their judges’) and their legitimacy would be contested by each new parliamentary majority. That is clearly in conflict with the individual’s right to hearing of his case by an independent court as the stability of court decisions would hinge on changes of the country’s political majority.",
                "In this context, it should be noted that, according to the official statement of the Minister of Justice issued in the legislative procedure on 15 January 2020 at the Senate of the Republic of Poland, the membership of the [NCJ] was determined in such a way as to ensure that it was comprised of persons loyal to the parliamentary majority (the political group represented by the Minister of Justice): ‘each group could propose judges they are accountable for. We have proposed judges who we thought were willing to co-operate with the judicial reform’ – transcript of the third session of the Senate of the Republic of Poland of the 10 th term, 15 January 2020).",
                "Consequently, appointments granted by the [NCJ] are systemically not independent of political interest, affecting the fulfilment of the objective criteria of impartiality and independence by persons appointed to the office of a judge on the motion of the [NCJ]. In other words, because the [NCJ] has been politicised, competitions for judicial positions are very likely to be decided not based on substantive criteria but depending on political loyalties or support for the reform of the judiciary pursued by the parliamentary majority in conflict with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland ...",

Significant influence exerted by the Minister of Justice, who is also Prosecutor General, on the membership of the [NCJ] (confirmed in his aforementioned official statement in the Senate of the Republic of Poland) and consequently on decisions of that body concerning judicial appointments, undermines the objective conditions of impartiality in cases where a person so appointed for the position of a judge were to participate in the court formation while the Prosecutor General or the public prosecutor’s office headed by the Prosecutor General were a party to such proceedings.",

However, such defect and its effect undermining the criteria of independence and impartiality of the court may prevail to a different degree. First and foremost, the severity and scope of the procedural effect of a defective judicial appointment varies depending on the type of the court and the position of such court in the organisation of the judiciary. The status of a judge of an ordinary court or a military court is different from the status of a judge of the Supreme Court....The severity of irregularities in competition procedures for the appointment of judges of ordinary and military courts and judges of the Supreme Court, since the normative changes implemented in 2017, has varied; however, it was definitely more severe in the case of appointments for judicial positions in the Supreme Court”...."

                "The Leitmotif of the change was to subordinate judges and courts to political authorities and to replace judges of different courts, including the Supreme Court. That affected the appointment procedure of judges and the bodies participating in the procedure, as well as the system for the promotion and disciplining of judges. In particular, a manifestly unconstitutional attempt was made to remove some judges of the Supreme Court and to terminate the mandate of the First President of the Supreme Court, contesting the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.",
                "The systemic changes caused doubts about the adjudicating legitimacy of judges appointed to the office in the new procedures. The political motivation for the changes jeopardised the objective conditions necessary for courts and judges to be perceived as impartial and independent. The Supreme Court considers that the politicisation of courts and their subordination to the parliamentary majority in breach of constitutional procedures establishes a permanent system where the legitimacy of individual judges and their judgments may be challenged with every new political authority. That notwithstanding, the politicisation of courts departs from the criteria of independence and impartiality of courts required under Union law and international law, in particular Article 47 of the Charter and Article 6 § 1 [of the Convention].",
                "That, in turn, causes uncertainty about the recognition of judgments of Polish courts in the Union space of freedom, justice and security. Even now courts in certain EU Member States refuse to co-operate, invoking violation of standards, and challenge judgments of Polish courts. It should be noted that a resolution of the Supreme Court cannot mitigate all risks arising in the functioning of the Polish judiciary at the systemic level. In fact, that could only be done by the legislature if it restored regulations concerning the judiciary that are consistent with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and Union law.",
                "The Supreme Court may, at best, take into consideration such risks and the principles of stability of the case-law and legal certainty for individuals in its interpretations of provisions which guarantee that a judgment in a specific case will be given by an impartial and independent court. In its interpretation of the regulations governing criminal and civil proceedings, referred by the First President of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court considered the effect of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 19 November 2019 in cases C-585/18, C ‑ 624/18 and C-625/18, as well as the obligation to identify such legislative instruments in the legal system which would guarantee that a judgment will be issued by an impartial and independent tribunal despite doubts arising from a range of systemic changes affecting the status of judges.”",

It should be stressed that, pursuant to Article 91 § 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, if an agreement, ratified by the Republic of Poland, establishing an international organisation so provides, the laws established by it shall be applied directly and take precedence in the event of a conflict of laws. That concerns in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Consequently, in the event of a conflict of laws with norms arising from such legal act, Polish courts are required to disregard such laws in adjudicating.",
                "In this context, it is important to quote once again in extenso the principle reiterated on many occasions in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union ...: ‘any provision of a national legal system and any legislative, administrative or judicial practice which might impair the effectiveness of Community law by withholding from the national court having jurisdiction to apply such law the power to do everything necessary at the moment of its application to set aside national legislative provisions which might prevent Community rules from having full force and effect are incompatible with those requirements which are the very essence of Community law.’ That is because a ‘national court which is called upon, within the limits of its jurisdiction, to apply provisions of Community law is under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently’ (judgment of March 1977, C-106/77).",
                "Therefore, a law or decision of any national body cannot prevent Polish courts from applying European Union law, prohibit an interpretation of Polish law in line with European Union law, or especially impose any restrictions or sanctions on judges who, exercising their judicial power and acting as a court, respect the obligations arising from the European Union membership of the Republic of Poland.",
                "If, however, the Constitution of Poland, in particular Article 179, which provides that judges shall be appointed by the President of the Republic of Poland on a motion of the [NCJ], is found to prevent review of the independence and impartiality of a court adjudicating in a given case, then the Polish Constitution would be in fundamental conflict with Article 47 of the Charter. In the territory of the European Union, the independence and impartiality of courts must be genuine; and their independence and impartiality cannot be uncontestably decreed by the mere fact of appointment to the office of judge by the President of the Republic of Poland.”"

Article 187 § 1 (2) of the Constitution only stipulates that these persons [judicial members of the NCJ] are elected from among judges. The Constitution did not specify who should elect those judges. Thus, the question of who can be elected as member of the NCJ follows from the Constitution, but it is not specified how judicial members of the Council are to be elected. These matters were delegated to statutory regulation. There is no obstacle for election of judges to the NCJ by judges. However, one cannot agree with the assertion that the right to elect [judicial members of the NCJ] is vested solely in assemblies of judges. While Article 187 § 1 (3) of the Constitution clearly indicates that MPs are elected to the NCJ by Sejm and senators by the Senate, there are no constitutional guidelines in respect of judicial members of the NCJ. This means that the Constitution does not determine who may elect judges to the NCJ.

The first – external – aspect of the judge’s independence presupposes that the court, in its adjudication, performs its tasks completely independently, without being subject to any official hierarchy or subordinated to anyone, and does not receive orders or instructions from any source whatsoever, such that it is protected from interference and external pressure that might compromise the independence of its members (judges) when they examine cases. The content of the impugned resolution of the Supreme Court granting to some judges the right to decide that other judges appointed by the President have, de facto, the status of retired judges ab initio cannot be reconciled with the standard as outlined above, resulting from all the indicated relevant standards. As the CJEU points out, the second – internal – aspect of the independence of a judge - is linked to the concept of impartiality and concerns an unbiased dissociation from the litigants, and their respective interests, in relation to a dispute before the court. This factor requires [of a judge] the observance of objectivity and the absence of any interest in the resolution of the dispute, apart from the strict application of the law. This aspect excludes a procedure generally questioning a judge’s right to adjudicate by other judges and verifying the regularity of the procedure preceding the appointment of a judge by the President as a basis for a general objection to such a judge’s right to adjudicate. An unbiased dissociation of a judge from a dispute is possible only where any conclusions of the court leading to the resolution of a case are based on respect for the Constitution as a foundation. Such aspect of the judge’s independence excludes the content of the court’s judgment from being made dependent on the need to choose between a constitutional provision and the content of a [law] that is in conflict with the Constitution, but which – as a result of a statutory regulation – could in all likelihood constitute a ground for challenging the judgment before a higher court.

                "The Constitutional Court upholds the view expressed earlier that ‘judges are appointed by the President, on a motion of the NCJ, for an indefinite period of time’. The Constitution identifies two entities involved in the judicial appointment procedure – the President and the NCJ. The judicial appointment procedure under the Constitution thus involves cooperation between two bodies, one of which has a direct mandate from the public, and the other – due to the participation of, inter alia, MPs and senators - has an indirect mandate ..., although it should be noted that there are only six MPs and senators in the 25 ‑ member NCJ (four MPs and two senators). Under Article 144 § 3 (17) of the Constitution, the power to appoint judges belongs to those official acts of the President which, in order to be valid, do not require the countersignature of the Prime Minister (the so-called prerogative). ... By vesting the power to appoint judges in the President, the Constitution thus adopts a system of judicial appointment, albeit of a limited nature. Although judicial appointments do not require countersignature, the constitutional requirement of a motion of the NCJ significantly restricts the President’s freedom of action in this situation. The President may not appoint every person who meets the requirements for election to the judiciary, but only a person whose candidature has been considered and indicated by the NCJ. ... In the light of the prevailing views of legal scholars, there is no doubt that, although the President’s freedom of action is limited to taking a stance on the candidate proposed by the NCJ, the fact that the competences concerning appointment of judges have been made into a prerogative emphasises that the President is not legally obliged to grant the NCJ’s motion. ... The power to appoint judges is, under Article 144 § 3 (17) of the Constitution, a prerogative of the President, that is, his personal prerogative, which in order to be valid does not require the signature of the Prime Minister. As such, it remains within the President’s exclusive competence and responsibility, although this does not mean that he may act entirely freely - he is bound by the principles and values expressed in the Constitution, the observance of which, pursuant to Article 126 § 2 of the Constitution, he is obliged to ensure. The prerogative regarding the appointment of judges is specified in Article 179 of the Constitution. This provision, stipulating that judges shall be appointed by the President on the motion of the NCJ, for an indefinite period, precisely defines the competences of both the President and the NCJ. It is for the NCJ to submit a motion for the appointment of judges (identification of candidates for specific judicial positions).”",

Since this provision laid down the President’s exclusive prerogatives, all other acts being subject to the Prime Minister’s countersignature, it had to be interpreted strictly. Nor could it be said that the act of announcement of vacant positions in the Supreme Court could be derived from the President’s power to appoint judges under Article 144 § 3 (17) of the Constitution since the exercise of any derived prerogative not requiring the countersignature must be necessary for the proper accomplishment of the main prerogative.",

In any case, the conditions and procedure for appointing the Presidents of the Supreme Court should be open and transparent to ensure that objective criteria of merit and competence prevail and that the best candidate is ultimately appointed (see pars 103-104 infra ). The fact that the President of the Republic of Poland has the final say in this process means that one cannot exclude that political or other considerations may prevail over criteria for appointment. Moreover, overall, there is a risk of having a future President of the Disciplinary Chamber, who would be somewhat beholden towards the appointing authority in a manner that may undermine judicial independence (see also Sub-Section 4.2 infra regarding the appointment of presidents of the Supreme Court and related recommendation in par 105 infra ).",
                "69. Moreover, allowing the President of the Disciplinary Chamber a say when appointing/dismissing chairs of department in other chambers and during the selection of lay judges seems to go quite far and also does not appear to be linked in any way to disciplinary matters. In light of the above, these provisions would open the door for indirect influence of the President of the Republic, who is part of the executive branch, in these areas, which should be under the sole responsibility of the First President of the Supreme Court. The specific status and rules applicable solely to the Disciplinary Chamber and its President, particularly with regard to the President of the Republic’s special role, should be reconsidered.”"

Three of them had been previously seconded to the Ministry of Justice, while seven had previously been appointed by the Minister of Justice as presidents or vice-presidents of ordinary courts (cf. paragraph 40 of section 1.5 below).

Despite being nominally positioned within the organisational structure of the Supreme Court, the Disciplinary Chamber, unlike that Court’s other chambers, is virtually exempt from the oversight of the Supreme Court’s First President. It notably has a separate chancellery and budget; moreover, the earnings of judges sitting on the Disciplinary Chamber are 40% higher than those of their fellow judges in other chambers of the Supreme Court....",

The Commissioner was informed that similarly to the newly composed [NCJ], many of the newly appointed members of the Disciplinary Chamber were former prosecutors or persons with links to the Minister of Justice (Prosecutor-General).

In tandem with the sweeping changes described in the previous sections, government officials in Poland have openly assailed the judiciary in order to justify the reforms being undertaken. In a speech delivered in July 2017, the former Prime Minister called Poland’s judiciary the ‘judicial corporation’, claiming that ‘in everybody’s immediate surrounding there is someone who has been injured by the judicial system’. In an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner in December 2017, the current Prime Minister argued that the Polish judiciary was a legacy of Communist system, characterised by ‘nepotism and corruption’; that judges demanded ‘[b]ribes (...) in some of the most lucrative-looking cases’; and that the courts generally worked to benefit the wealthy and the influential. The Prime Minister later made similar statements in other contexts, including in a speech given at a US university in April 2019. Other members of the ruling party called judges ‘a caste’ or ‘a group of cronies’. The current head of the political cabinet in the chancellery of the Prime Minister publicly implied that former judge-members of the National Council of the Judiciary ‘were hiding gold in their gardens and it is unclear where the money came from’. In support of the government’s reform of the judiciary, in September 2017 the government-controlled ‘Polish National Foundation’ initiated a two ‑ month campaign called ‘Fair Courts’. The campaign’s cost, estimated to amount to EUR 2.8 million, was cosponsored by a dozen or so of the largest state-owned companies. Using large black-and-white billboards, television commercials and a website, the campaign conveyed a negative image of judges, labelling them as ‘a special caste’, and portraying them as incompetent or indulging in unseemly or illegal behaviour, such as drunkenness, corruption, or petty theft ...",

In view of the highly stigmatising and harmful effect of statements such as the ones quoted above (in paragraph 52), the Commissioner urges the Polish authorities to exercise responsibility and lead by example in their public discourse, rather than using their powerful platform to tarnish the judiciary as a whole or to unduly attack the reputation of individual judges.”",

What matters most is the extent to which the head of state is free in deciding on the appointment. It should be ensured that the main role in the process is given to an independent body – the judicial council. The proposals from this council may be rejected only exceptionally, and the President would not be allowed to appoint a candidate not included on the list submitted by it.

Given that six other members of the NCJ are parliamentarians, and four others are ex officio members or appointed by the President of the Republic (see Article 187 § 1 of the Constitution), the proposed reform will lead to a NCJ dominated by political nominees.

It will also be competent to deal with other disciplinary cases which may fall within the jurisdiction of the SC.

In respect of the Disciplinary Chamber the First President will have very few powers, which weakens his role within the SC, foreseen by the Constitution. Furthermore, by virtue of their special competencies, the two chambers will be de facto superior to other, “ordinary” chambers of the SC. Establishing such hierarchy within the SC is problematic.

In many states, however, the great majority of judges are not members of associations. The participation of both categories of judges (members and non-members of associations) in a pluralist formation of the Council for the Judiciary would be more representative of the courts. Therefore, judges’ associations must be allowed to put forward judge candidates (or a list of candidates) for election, and the same arrangement should be available to judges who are not members of such associations.

Out of these concerns, the only significant change in the present draft presented by the President of Poland is the requirement for a majority of 3/5 in Sejm for electing 15 judge members of the Council. However, this does not change in any way the fundamental concern of transferring the power to appoint members of the Council from the judiciary to the legislature, resulting in a severe risk of politicised judge members as a consequence of a politicised election procedure. This risk may be said to be even greater with the new draft, since it provides that if a 3/5 majority cannot be reached, those judges having received the largest number of votes will be elected.",

Furthermore, the establishment of the special chambers for extraordinary appeals and for disciplinary matters has been criticised for creating a hierarchy within the court, in that these two chambers have been granted special status and may be seen as superior to the other ‘ordinary chambers’: the extraordinary appeals chamber may examine decisions taken by the ‘ordinary chambers’ of the SC, the disciplinary chamber having jurisdiction over disciplinary cases of judges sitting in the other chambers as well as a separate budget (and, in addition, judges of the disciplinary chamber receive a 40% higher salary). Moreover, the use of lay judges at the SC, which has been introduced as a way of bringing in a ‘social factor’ into the system, according to the Polish authorities, has also been criticised, partly for being alien to other judicial systems in Europe at the level of supreme courts, but also due to the unsuitability of lay persons for determining significant cases involving legal complexities. The fact that they are elected by the legislature, which has the potential of compromising their independence, is a particular concern in this respect.”",

In particular, it stated that “the new laws raised serious concerns as regards their compatibility with the Polish Constitution as underlined by a number of opinions, in particular from the Supreme Court, the [NCJ] and the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights”. However, as explained in the Rule of Law Recommendation of 26 July 2017, an effective constitutional review of these laws was no longer possible. The Commission stated:",
                "“31. Also, the new regime for appointing judges-members of the [NCJ] raises serious concerns. Well established European standards, in particular the 2010 Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, stipulate that ‘not less than half the members of [Councils for the Judiciary] should be judges chosen by their peers from all levels of the judiciary and with respect for pluralism inside the judiciary. It is up to the Member States to organise their justice systems, including whether or not to establish a Council for the Judiciary. However, where such a Council has been established, as it is the case in Poland, its independence must be guaranteed in line with European standards. 32. Until the adoption of the law on the [NCJ], the Polish system was fully in line with these standards since the [NCJ] was composed of a majority of judges chosen by judges. Articles 1(1) and 7 of the law amending the law on the [NCJ] would radically change this regime by providing that the 15 judges-members of the [NCJ] will be appointed, and can be re-appointed, by Sejm. In addition, there is no guarantee that under the new law Sejm will appoint judges-members of the Council endorsed by the judiciary, as candidates to these posts can be presented not only by groups of 25 judges, but also by groups of at least 2 000 citizens. Furthermore, the final list of candidates to which Sejm will have to give its approval en bloc is pre-established by a committee of Sejm. The new rules on appointment of judges-members of the [NCJ] significantly increase the influence of the Parliament over the Council and adversely affect its independence in contradiction with the European standards. The fact that the judges-members will be appointed by Sejm with a three fifths majority does not alleviate this concern, as judges-members will still not be chosen by their peers. In addition, in case such a three fifths majority is not reached, judges-members of the Council will be appointed by Sejm with absolute majority of votes.",
                "33. This situation raises concerns from the point of view of the independence of the judiciary. For example, a district court judge who has to deliver a judgment in a politically sensitive case, while the judge is at the same time applying for a promotion to become a regional court judge, may be inclined to follow the position favoured by the political majority in order not to put his/her chances to obtain the promotion into jeopardy. Even if this risk does not materialise, the new regime does not provide for sufficient guarantees to secure the appearance of independence which is crucial to maintain the confidence which tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Also, assistant judges will have to be assessed by a politically influenced [NCJ] prior to their appointment as judge.",

The Venice Commission concludes that the election of the 15 judicial members of the National Council of the Judiciary by Parliament, in conjunction with the immediate replacement of the currently sitting members, will lead to a far-reaching politicisation of this body. The Venice Commission recommends that, instead, judicial members of the [NCJ] should be elected by their peers, as in the current Act.

A new chamber of extraordinary control and public matters will assess cases brought under the new extraordinary appeal procedure. It appears that this new chamber will be composed in majority of new judges and will ascertain the validity of general and local elections and examining electoral disputes, including electoral disputes in European Parliament elections. In addition, a new autonomous disciplinary chamber composed solely of new judges will be tasked with reviewing in the first and second instance disciplinary cases against Supreme Court judges. These two new largely autonomous chambers composed with new judges raise concerns as regards the separation of powers. As noted by the Venice Commission, while both chambers are part of the Supreme Court, in practice they are above all other chambers, creating a risk that the whole judicial system will be dominated by these chambers which are composed of new judges elected with a decisive influence of the ruling majority. Also, the Venice Commission underlines that the law will make the judicial review of electoral disputes particularly vulnerable to political influence, creating a serious risk for the functioning of Polish democracy ...”",

The Commission observes that within a period of two years more than 13 consecutive laws have been adopted affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland: the Constitutional [Court], the Supreme Court, the ordinary courts, the [NCJ], the prosecution service and the National School of Judiciary. The ordinary pattern of all these legislative changes is that the executive or legislative powers have been systematically enabled to interfere significantly with the composition, the powers, the administration and the functioning of these authorities and bodies. The legislative changes and their combined effects put at serious risk the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers in Poland which are key components of the rule of law. The Commission also observes that such intense legislative activity has been conducted without proper consultation of all the stakeholders concerned, without a spirit of loyal cooperation required between state authorities and without consideration for the opinions from a wide range of European and international organisations.”"

The resolution reiterated that the independence of the judiciary was enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter and Article 6 of the Convention, and was an essential requirement of the democratic principle of the separation of powers, which was also reflected in Article 10 of the Polish Constitution. It expressed deep concern at the redrafted legislation relating to the Polish judiciary, in particular, its potential to undermine structurally judicial independence and weaken the rule of law in Poland. The Polish Parliament and the Government were urged to implement fully all recommendations of the Commission and the Venice Commission, and to refrain from conducting any reform which would put at risk respect for the rule of law, and in particular the independence of the judiciary.

                "131. I observe that the NCJ is a body whose mission is to safeguard the independence of courts and judges under the Polish constitution, and its functions include the selection of judges of the Supreme Court, including the Disciplinary Chamber, for appointment by the President of the Republic (see points 16 and 19 of this Opinion). Thus, the NCJ must be free of influence from the legislative and executive authorities in order to duly perform its tasks.",
                "132. Yet, the manner of appointment of the members of the NCJ itself discloses deficiencies which appear likely to compromise its independence from the legislative and executive authorities. First, this is based on the fact that, according to Article 9a of the Law on the NCJ (see point 22 of this Opinion), the 15 judicial members of the NCJ are no longer appointed by the judges, but instead by Sejm. This means that the NCJ is composed of a majority of 23 of 25 members coming from the legislative and executive authorities.",
                "133. Moreover, according to Article 11a(2) of the Law on the NCJ, candidates for the judicial members of the NCJ can be proposed by groups of at least 2,000 Polish citizens or 25 judges. Pursuant to Article 11d of that law, the election of those members to the NCJ is carried out by Sejm by a majority of 3/5 of the votes cast in the presence of at least half of the deputies entitled to vote (see points 24 and 25 of this Opinion).",
                "134. Accordingly, it may be considered that the manner of appointment of the NCJ members entails influence of the legislative authorities over the NCJ, and it cannot be discounted that Sejm may choose candidates with little or no support from judges, with the result that the judicial community’s opinion may have insufficient weight in the process of the election of the NCJ members. Irrespective of the alleged aims of enhancing the democratic legitimacy and the representativeness of the NCJ, this arrangement is apt to adversely affect the independence of the NCJ.",
                "135. It should also be borne in mind that the changes to the manner of appointment of the judicial members of the NCJ were accompanied by the premature termination of the mandates of the members of the NCJ. It has not been disputed that the Law on the NCJ provides for early termination of the judicial members of the NCJ at the moment of the election of the new members (see points 22 and 26 of this Opinion). Notwithstanding the purported aim to unify the terms of office of the NCJ membership, the immediate replacement of the currently sitting members of the NCJ in tandem with the new regime for appointment of the NCJ may be considered to further impair the NCJ’s independence from the legislative and executive authorities.”"

As far as concerns the circumstances in which the members of the Disciplinary Chamber were appointed, the Court points out, as a preliminary remark, that the mere fact that those judges were appointed by the President of the Republic does not give rise to a relationship of subordination of the former to the latter or to doubts as to the former’s impartiality, if, once appointed, they are free from influence or pressure when carrying out their role (see, to that effect, judgment of 31 January 2013, D. and A., C‑175/11, EU:C:2013:45, paragraph 99, and ECtHR, 28 June 1984, Campbell and Fell v.

In the present cases, it should be made clear that Article 30 of the New Law on the Supreme Court sets out all the conditions which must be satisfied by an individual in order for that individual to be appointed as a judge of that court. Furthermore, under Article 179 of the Constitution and Article 29 of the New Law on the Supreme Court, the judges of the Disciplinary Chamber are, as is the case for judges who are to sit in the other chambers of the referring court, appointed by the President of the Republic on a proposal of the [NCJ], that is to say the body empowered under Article 186 of the Constitution to ensure the independence of the courts and of the judiciary.",
                "137. The participation of such a body, in the context of a process for the appointment of judges, may, in principle, be such as to contribute to making that process more objective (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 June 2019, Commission v. Poland (Independence of the Supreme Court), C ‑ 619/18, EU:C:2019:531, paragraph 115; see also, to that effect, ECtHR, 18 October 2018, Thiam v. France, CE:ECHR:2018:1018JUD008001812, §§ 81 and 82). In particular, the fact of subjecting the very possibility for the President of the Republic to appoint a judge to the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court) to the existence of a favourable opinion of the [NCJ] is capable of objectively circumscribing the President of the Republic’s discretion in exercising the powers of his office.",
                "138. However, that is only the case provided, inter alia, that that body is itself sufficiently independent of the legislature and executive and of the authority to which it is required to deliver such an appointment proposal (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 June 2019, Commission v Poland (Independence of the Supreme Court), C ‑ 619/18, EU:C:2019:531, paragraph 116).",

It is for the referring court to ascertain whether or not the [NCJ] offers sufficient guarantees of independence in relation to the legislature and the executive, having regard to all of the relevant points of law and fact relating both to the circumstances in which the members of that body are appointed and the way in which that body actually exercises its role.",

In that regard, although one or other of the factors thus pointed to by the referring court may be such as to escape criticism per se and may fall, in that case, within the competence of, and choices made by, the Member States, when taken together, in addition to the circumstances in which those choices were made, they may, by contrast, throw doubt on the independence of a body involved in the procedure for the appointment of judges, despite the fact that, when those factors are taken individually, that conclusion is not inevitable.",
                "143. Subject to those reservations, among the factors pointed to by the referring court which it shall be incumbent on that court, as necessary, to establish, the following circumstances may be relevant for the purposes of such an overall assessment: first, the [NCJ], as newly composed, was formed by reducing the ongoing four-year term in office of the members of that body at that time; second, whereas the 15 members of the [NCJ] elected among members of the judiciary were previously elected by their peers, those judges are now elected by a branch of the legislature among candidates capable of being proposed inter alia by groups of 2,000 citizens or 25 judges, such a reform leading to appointments bringing the number of members of the [NCJ] directly originating from or elected by the political authorities to 23 of the 25 members of that body; third, the potential for irregularities which could adversely affect the process for the appointment of certain members of the newly formed [NCJ].",
                "144. For the purposes of that overall assessment, the referring court is also justified in taking into account the way in which that body exercises its constitutional responsibilities of ensuring the independence of the courts and of the judiciary and its various powers, in particular if it does so in a way which is capable of calling into question its independence in relation to the legislature and the executive.",
                "145. Furthermore, in the light of the fact that, as is clear from the case file before the Court, the decisions of the President of the Republic appointing judges to the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court) are not amenable to judicial review, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the terms of the definition, in Article 44(1) and (1a) of the Law on the [NCJ], of the scope of the action which may be brought challenging a resolution of the [NCJ], including its decisions concerning proposals for appointment to the post of judge of that court, allows an effective judicial review to be conducted of such resolutions, covering, at the very least, an examination of whether there was no ultra vires or improper exercise of authority, error of law or manifest error of assessment (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 18 October 2018, Thiam v. France, CE:ECHR:2018:1018JUD008001812, §§ 25 and 81).",

Notwithstanding the assessment of the circumstances in which the new judges of the Disciplinary Chamber were appointed and the role of the [NCJ] in that regard, the referring court may, for the purposes of ascertaining whether that chamber and its members meet the requirements of independence and impartiality arising from Article 47 of the Charter, also wish to take into consideration various other features that more directly characterise that chamber.",
                "147. That applies, first, to the fact referred to by the referring court that this court has been granted exclusive jurisdiction, under Article 27(1) of the New Law on the Supreme Court, to rule on cases of the employment, social Security and retirement of judges of the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court), which previously fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.",
                "148. Although that fact is not conclusive per se, it should, however, be borne in mind, as regards, in particular, cases relating to the retiring of judges of the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court) such as those in the main proceedings, that the assignment of those cases to the Disciplinary Chamber took place in conjunction with the adoption, which was highly contentious, of the provisions of the New Law on the Supreme Court which lowered the retirement age of the judges of the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court), applied that measure to judges currently serving in that court and empowered the President of the Republic with discretion to extend the exercise of active judicial service of the judges of the referring court beyond the new retirement age set by that law.",
                "149. It must be borne in mind, in that regard, that, in its judgment of 24 June 2019, Commission v. Poland (Independence of the Supreme Court) (C ‑ 619/18, EU:C:2019:531), the Court found that, as a result of adopting those measures, the Republic of Poland had undermined the irremovability and independence of the judges of the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court) and failed to fulfil its obligations under the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU.",
                "150. Second, in that context, the fact must also be highlighted, as it was by the referring court, that, under Article 131 of the New Law on the Supreme Court, the Disciplinary Chamber must be constituted solely of newly appointed judges, thereby excluding judges already serving in the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court).",
                "151. Third, it should be made clear that, although established as a chamber of the Sąd Najwyższy (Supreme Court), the Disciplinary Chamber appears, by contrast to the other chambers of that court, and as is clear inter alia from Article 20 of the New Law on the Supreme Court, to enjoy a particularly high degree of autonomy within the referring court.",

The domestic proceedings concerned a District Court judge, M.F., against whom, on 17 January 2019, disciplinary proceedings were instituted. In those proceedings it was alleged that her conduct resulted in overly lengthy proceedings and that she had failed to draw up written grounds for her judgments in a timely manner. On 28 January 2019, J.M., acting as a judge of the Supreme Court performing the duties of the President of the Supreme Court who directed the work of the Disciplinary Chamber, issued an order rendering the disciplinary court competent to hear her case at first instance. M.F. brought an action for a declaratory judgment together with an application for an injunction against J.M., seeking to establish that the latter was not a judge of the Supreme Court because he had not been appointed to the position of judge of the Supreme Court in the Disciplinary Chamber. According to the claimant his appointment on 20 September 2018 was ineffective because he had been appointed: (i) after the selection procedure had been conducted by the NCJ on the basis of an announcement of the President of the Republic of Poland, of 29 June 2018, which had been signed by the President without the countersignature of the Prime Minister; (ii) after the resolution of the NCJ which contained the motion to appoint J.M. to the position of Supreme Court judge in the Disciplinary Chamber had been appealed against to the Supreme Administrative Court on 17 September 2018 by one of the participants in the selection procedure, and before that court had ruled on the appeal.

I consider (as does the [Polish Commissioner for Human Rights]) that the connecting factors between the action in the main proceedings and the EU law provisions raised in the questions referred relate to the fact that a national judge (M.F.) who may rule on the application or interpretation of EU law is asking that she is afforded, in the context of a disciplinary action levelled against her, the benefit of the effective judicial protection guaranteed by Article 19(1) TEU in the light of Article 47 of the Charter. Such protection implies an obligation for the Member States to ‘provide the necessary guarantees in order to prevent any risk of that disciplinary regime being used as a system of political control of the content of judicial decisions’, (3) which means that M.F. has a right to be judged by an independent and impartial court established by law. That also means that the tribunal called upon to rule on her disciplinary procedure cannot be appointed by a judge whose own appointment breached the very same provision of EU law even though he himself gives rulings relating to the application or interpretation of EU law...",

Failure to do so would be an infringement of the principle of effective judicial protection, since at the very least it creates a serious risk that judicial authorities which do not meet EU standards will be established, even if only temporarily. I agree with the [Polish Commissioner for Human Rights] that it would also potentially infringe Articles 4(3) TEU and 267 TFEU, as the President of the Republic would limit the effet utile of the preliminary ruling procedure and would circumvent the binding character of the decisions of the Court.",

In addition, the court will need to assess whether national provisions, such as those contained in Article 44(1a) to (4) of the [2011 Act on the NCJ as amended by the 2017 Amending Act], are such as to give rise to legitimate doubts, in the minds of subjects of the law, as to the imperviousness of the judges appointed on the basis of the [NCJ] resolutions to external factors and, in particular, to the direct or indirect influence of the Polish legislature and executive, and as to their neutrality with respect to any interests before them and, thus, may lead to those judges not being seen to be independent or impartial with the consequence of prejudicing the trust which justice in a democratic society governed by the rule of law must inspire in subjects of the law. ...",

As the [Polish Commissioner for Human Rights] rightly submitted, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU and Article 47 of the Charter, the appointment process must not give rise to reasonable doubts, in the minds of the subjects of the law, as to the imperviousness of the judges concerned to external factors, once the interested parties are appointed as judges. Therefore, given the key role played by the [NCJ] in the judicial appointment process and the absence of legal review of the decisions of the President of the Republic appointing a judge, it is necessary that effective legal review exists for the judicial candidates. That is particularly the case where, as in this instance, the State, by way of its conduct, is interfering in the process of appointing judges in a manner which risks compromising the future independence of those judges. The required legal review should: (a) happen before the appointment, as the judge is thus protected a posteriori by the principle of irremovability; (b) cover at least an ultra vires or improper exercise of authority, error of law or manifest error of assessment; and (c) allow clarification of all the aspects of the appointment procedure, including the requirements under EU law, if appropriate, by submitting questions to the Court inter alia concerning the requirements stemming from the principle of effective judicial protection. ...",

                "64. It will ultimately be for the referring court to assess this point on the basis of all the relevant elements, but to my mind the irregularity committed during the appointment of the judge of the CECPA ( 22 ) in question (judge A.S.) stems a fortiori from the fact that he was appointed within the Supreme Court and within that chamber despite the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court ordering that the execution of [NCJ] resolution No 331/2018 be stayed.§ 65. Therefore, I agree with the referring court and also W.Ż., the [Polish Commissioner for Human Rights] and the Commission that the deliberate and intentional infringement by the executive branch of a judicial decision, in particular a decision of the Supreme Administrative Court ordering interim measures (that is, the order of 27 September 2018) – manifestly with the aim of ensuring that the government has an influence on judicial appointments – demonstrates a lack of respect for the principle of the rule of law and constitutes per se an infringement by the executive branch of ‘fundamental rules forming an integral part of the establishment and functioning of that judicial system’ within the meaning of paragraph 75 of judgment of 26 March 2020, Review Simpson and HG v Council and Commission (C ‑ 542/18 RX ‑ II and C ‑ 543/18 RX ‑ II, EU:C:2020:232) (‘the judgment in Simpson and HG’). ...",
                "77. In Ástráðsson v. Iceland, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR – largely upholding the chamber ruling of 12 March 2019 – ruled that, given the potential implications of finding a breach and the important interests at stake, the right to a ‘tribunal established by law’ should not be construed too broadly such that any irregularity in a judicial appointment procedure would risk compromising that right. The ECtHR thus formulated a three-step test to determine whether irregularities in a judicial appointment procedure were of such gravity as to entail a violation of the right to a tribunal established by law: step 1, whether there has been a manifest breach of domestic law (§§ 244 and 245 of that judgment); step 2, whether breaches of domestic law pertained to any fundamental rule of the judicial appointment procedure (§§ 246 and 247); and step 3, whether the alleged violations of the right to a ‘tribunal established by law’ were effectively reviewed and remedied by the domestic courts (§§ 248 to 252).",
                "78. The above principles apply not only in the case of infringements of provisions governing specifically the appointment procedure stricto sensu, but, as the present case shows, they must also apply in the case of disregard of judicial control introduced in relation to previous acts of appointment having a constitutive character vis-à-vis that appointment (such as [NCJ] resolution No 331/2018 here).",
                "79. As the Commission pointed out, in relation to the rules of appointment of judges, it is not surprising that both the ECtHR (in the judgment of 1 December 2020 Ástráðsson v. Iceland, § 247) and the Court (in the judgment in Simpson and HG, paragraph 75) make a direct link between the requirement that a tribunal must be established by law and the principle of judicial independence in the sense that it is necessary to examine whether an irregularity committed during the appointment of judges ‘create[s] a real risk that other branches of the State, in particular the executive, could exercise undue discretion undermining the integrity of the outcome of the appointment process and thus give rise to a reasonable doubt in the minds of individuals as to the independence and the impartiality of the judge or judges concerned’ ( Simpson and HG, paragraph 75). ...",
                "84. As far as the requirement ‘established by law’ is concerned, as pointed out by the [Polish Commissioner for Human Rights], the strict respect of appointment rules is necessary, as it gives the appointed judge the feeling that he or she obtained the position purely on the basis of their qualifications and objective criteria and at the end of a reliable procedure, avoiding the creation of any relation of dependence between the judge and the authorities intervening in that appointment. In the present case, the referring court established, in a convincing manner, on the one hand, that the effective legal review of the judicial appointment process constitutes a requirement flowing from the constitutional principles relating to the independence of the judiciary and to the subjective rights of access to a public function and to a court or tribunal and, on the other hand, that the appointment of the judge concerned arose in breach of that effective legal review and of the judicial decision having suspended the enforceability of [NCJ] resolution No 331/2018. ...",

In any event, the very fact that the President of the Republic paid no heed to the final decision of the Supreme Administrative Court – that is, the administrative court of final instance – ordering interim measures and staying the execution of [NCJ] Resolution No 331/2018 until that court rules on the main action pending before it, indicates the gravity of the breach that was committed.",

The referring court must, in that respect, assess the manifest and deliberate character of that breach as well as the gravity of the breach and must take into account the fact that the above appointment was made: (i) despite a prior appeal to the competent national court against the resolution of the National Council of the Judiciary, which included a motion for the appointment of that person to the position of judge and which was still pending at the relevant time; and/or (ii) despite the fact that the implementation of that resolution had been stayed in accordance with national law and those proceedings before the competent national court had not been concluded before the delivery of the appointment letter.”",

On 16 August 2018 the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ) adopted its “Position Paper of the Board of the ENCJ on the membership of the [NCJ] of Poland” and formulated a proposal to suspend the NCJ’s membership. Accordingly, on 17 September 2018, the Extraordinary General Assembly of the ENCJ decided to suspend the membership of the Polish NCJ (see paragraph 15 above). The relevant parts of the Position Paper read as follows:",
                "“The present law concerning the [NCJ] came into effect in January 2018. The essence of the reform is that the judicial members of the [NCJ] are no longer elected by their peers but are instead appointed by Parliament. Judges may be appointed by Parliament if they are supported by 25 judges or a group of 2000 citizens. The Board considers that this is a departure from the ENCJ standard that judges in a council should be elected by their peers. Although, non-compliance with this standard does not automatically imply that a council is not independent from the executive, in the case of the Polish Council the Board finds so many additional circumstances that it has reached the conclusion that the [NCJ] is no longer independent from the executive. These circumstances include the following:",

                "- In the selection process of a judicial member of the [NCJ] the lists of supportive judges are not made public, and so it cannot be checked whether the list consists primarily of judges seconded to the Ministry of Justice, or of the same 25 judges for every candidate; The judicial members of the [NCJ] have not published the list of supporting judges themselves, but they have instead provided the ENCJ only with a list showing the number of judges they were supported by;",

                "- Thirdly, they informed the Board that a majority of the members of the [NCJ] (14 out of 25) are either a member of the Law and Justice Party, a member of the government or are chosen by Parliament on the recommendation of the Law and Justice Party. The [NCJ] decides by simple majority;",

                "- Several members of the [NCJ] expressed the opinion that judges who publicly speak out against the reforms and/or speak out in defence of the independence of the judiciary should be disciplined because of unlawful political activity;",
                "- The [NCJ] does not speak out on behalf of the judges who defend the independence of the judiciary. For example: the judges in Krakow were publicly called criminals by the Prime Minister of Poland, and the [NCJ] did not object to it. The same goes for the [NCJ]’s attitude concerning the position of the First President of the Supreme Court;",

In this way it can continue to monitor the situation concerning the Rule of Law in Poland, for instance as to the disciplinary actions against judges who oppose the reforms.",

At the meeting of November 2019 the [NCJ] did not criticize the government at all. After enormous pressure, the lists of judges who supported the present members of the [NCJ] as candidates (a minimum of 25 supporting judges was required to be appointed), show support by a narrow group of judges associated with the Minister of Justice, including 50 judges seconded to the ministry. One candidate was appointed without the required minimum of 25 signatures from judges.",
                "Secondly. The [NCJ] openly supports the Executive and Legislature in its attacks on the independence of the Judiciary, especially by means of disciplinary actions. The answers of the [NCJ] in the letter of 13 March 2020 on these points strengthen the Executive Board in its opinion. In the answer to question 1, the [NCJ] acknowledges that 49 judges supporting the appointment of members of the [NCJ] were seconded to the Ministry of Justice, and thus cannot be viewed as independent from the ministry for the purposes of the ENCJ. In the answer to question 2, the [NCJ] acknowledges that many signatures of judges supporting the candidacy of member N. had been withdrawn before the election, thus casting doubt on the validity of his election, yet he continues to fulfil the role of a validly elected member of the council. In the answer to question 3, the [NCJ] only reiterates that it is not its task to monitor the declarations of the Minister of Justice and does not deny that the Minister of Justice has said in the Senate that he proposed judges to be appointed in the [NCJ] who, in his opinion, were ready to cooperate in the reform of the Judiciary. This amounts to a failure to promote the independence of the council and its members from the executive. In the answer to question 4, the [NCJ] argues that the members of the [NCJ] are not the representatives of judges, which is incompatible with the ENCJ Budapest Declaration 2008 that judicial members of a council must act as the representatives of the entire judiciary. The letter of 20 May 2020 makes no convincing argument against the conclusion that the [NCJ] does not fulfil the requirement of being independent of the executive.",

In the light of this requirement the Court was called upon to examine whether the domestic law had been complied with. In the present case the long series of irregularities which had resulted in the conclusion that the panel of judges of the Disciplinary Chamber which examined her case had not been a “tribunal established by law” had started with the structural changes to the NCJ. Contrary to the Constitution, which held that Sejm should only select four members of the NCJ, the 2017 Amending Act entrusted Sejm with the election of fifteen additional members, from among judges, who had so far been elected by their peers. As a result, the legislative and executive branches of power had granted themselves a quasi-monopoly to appoint the members of the NCJ in that they were to appoint twenty-three out of twenty-five members. This amounted to a breach of the Constitutional principle of separation of powers and ran counter to the previous case-law of the Constitutional Court from 2007. As a result, the NCJ had lost the ability to contribute to making the judicial appointment process objective. The applicant drew the Court’s attention to other cases pending before the Court concerning the termination of the terms of office of previous members of the NCJ ( Grzęda v. Poland, no. 43572/18) and the Disciplinary Chamber’s rulings against judges who had criticised the “reforms of the judiciary” ( Tuleya v. Poland, no. 21181/19).

The President was not bound by the recommendation of the NCJ in that he could decide not to appoint a person indicated by it. However, the President could not appoint a person who was not recommended by the NCJ. The mere fact that the judges were appointed by an executive body, the President, did not give rise to a relationship of subordination of the former to the latter or to doubts as to the former’s impartiality if once appointed they were free from influence or pressure when carrying out their role.

They considered that in Europe the participation of representatives of judicial authorities in the procedure for appointment of judges, particularly those of the Supreme Court, was limited or not foreseen at all.

As a matter of fact, Article 187 § 1 (2) of the Constitution provided for an election of the judicial members of the NCJ from among judges. The Constitution did not determine, however, who would elect these judges or how they would be elected. Consequently, it could be seen from the relevant provisions of the Constitution who could be elected as a judicial NCJ member, yet there was no mention of any modalities of the election of judges to the NCJ. In accordance with Article 187 § 4 of the Constitution these modalities were to be regulated by statute. Elections by representatives of the judiciary had not been annulled, yet the position that assemblies of judges were the only competent electoral bodies was unsubstantiated on the ground of the Constitution.

It was therefore legitimate that this question should be regulated within the limits of the legislator’s margin of appreciation. In this respect, the Constitution laid down a certain minimum number of fundamental safeguards. They also noted that after the amendments had entered into force, the NCJ would be elected by Sejm by a qualified majority of three-fifths of the votes, in the presence of at least half of those entitled to vote, which made this election the result of a cross-party agreement between various groups represented in Sejm and thus ensured high democratic legitimacy for the members of that body. The high qualified majority required for the election of the members of the NCJ who were judges distinguished the way in which they were elected from members who were MPs.

Thereby, the CJEU had confirmed that it respected the areas reserved for the member States. Although it observed in its ruling that any political factor involved in the appointment of judges might give rise to doubts and trigger an assessment of whether the court was an independent court, it also pointed out that it was only a set of factors that could lead to a final conclusion ruling out the existence of the attributes of independence and impartiality. In this context, it was also worth mentioning the CJEU judgment of 24 June 2019 (no.

The Commissioner also pointed to a general boycott of the elections to the new NCJ by the judges as a result of which out of a total of 10,000 Polish judges eligible, only eighteen candidates had applied for fifteen positions.

The competition for posts of judge had been boycotted by the whole legal profession in Poland as only 216 candidates had applied for forty-four positions.

The international standards on the independence of the judiciary enshrined the principle that the political powers – legislative and executive – should not be responsible for, or otherwise interfere with, the appointment, functioning, or removal of members of judicial councils.

Where the national courts have duly assessed the facts and the complaints in the light of the Convention standards, have adequately weighed in the balance the competing interests at stake and have drawn the necessary conclusions, the Court would need strong reasons to substitute its own assessment for that of the national courts. Accordingly, while the national courts have discretion in determining how to strike the relevant balance, they are nevertheless required to comply with their obligations deriving from the Convention when they are undertaking that balancing exercise (ibid. § 251, with further references to the Court’s case-law)."

Pursuant to these provisions read as a whole, judges are appointed to all levels and types of courts, including the Supreme Court, by the President of Poland following a recommendation of the NCJ – a recommendation which the NCJ issues after a competitive selection procedure in which it evaluates and nominates the candidates. The NCJ’s proposal of candidates to the President of Poland is a condition sine qua non for any judicial appointment (see Article 179 of the Constitution at paragraph 59 above).

The Government, in line with the Constitutional Court’s position in the June 2017 judgment, argued that the previous model had been replaced by a “more democratic” one and that that change had been prompted by the need to remove the hitherto existing – in their view unjustified – difference of treatment with regard to the election of judges at various court levels, which had discriminated against judges sitting in lower courts as it had not provided them with equal opportunities of standing for election (see paragraph 200 above)."

In this context, the Court reiterates that the right to a fair trial under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, which, in its relevant part, declares the rule of law to be part of the common heritage of the Contracting States. The right to “a tribunal established by law” is a reflection of this very principle of the rule of law and, as such, it plays an important role in upholding the separation of powers and the independence and legitimacy of the judiciary as required in a democratic society (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 237).",

While all three elements each serve specific purposes as distinct fair trial safeguards, the Court has discerned a common thread running through the institutional requirements of Article 6 § 1, in that they are guided by the aim of upholding the fundamental principles of the rule of law and the separation of powers (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, §§ 232 ‑ 233)."

Turning to the present case, the Court is not persuaded that the Constitutional Court’s judgment relied on by the Government deprived the Supreme Court’s resolution of its meaning or effects for the purposes of this Court’s ruling as to whether there has been a “manifest breach of the domestic law” in terms of Article 6 § 1. This judgment appears to focus mainly on protecting the President’s constitutional prerogative to appoint judges and the status quo of the current NCJ, leaving aside the issues which were crucial in the Supreme Court’s assessment, such as an inherent lack of independence of the NCJ which, in that court’s view, irretrievably tainted the whole process of judicial appointments, including to the Disciplinary Chamber. The Constitutional Court, while formally relying on the constitutional principles of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, refrained from any meaningful analysis of the Supreme Court’s resolution in the light of these principles.",

In particular, the Constitutional Court found that those Convention standards excluded the power of “other judges” to generally question a “judge’s right to adjudicate” or to verify “the regularity of the procedure preceding the appointment of a judge by the President” (see paragraph 116 above).",
                "The Court sees no conceivable basis in its case-law for such a conclusion. In that regard, it would reiterate that “independence of a tribunal established by law” refers to the necessary personal and institutional independence that is required for impartial decision making, and it is thus a prerequisite for impartiality. It characterises both (i) a state of mind, which denotes a judge’s imperviousness to external pressure as a matter of moral integrity, and (ii) a set of institutional and operational arrangements – involving both a procedure by which judges can be appointed in a manner that ensures their independence and selection criteria based on merit –, which must provide safeguards against undue influence and/or unfettered discretion of the other State powers, both at the initial stage of the appointment of a judge and during the exercise of his or her duties (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 234 and the case-law cited therein)."

The Court considers that this kind of interference with a judicial body, aimed at incapacitating it in the exercise of its adjudicatory function in the application and interpretation of the Convention and other international treaties, must be characterised as an affront to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.",

According to the information now in the public domain, the NCJ had been elected with the support of a narrow group of judges with strong ties to the executive (judges seconded to the Ministry of Justice and the presidents and vice-presidents of courts recently promoted to those offices by the Minister of Justice; see also paragraph 176 above). As indicated by the Supreme Court, there were also doubts as to whether all elected members of the NCJ had fulfilled the legal requirement of having been supported by twenty-five active judges (see paragraphs 78 and 96 above and the statement by the third-party intervener at paragraph 207 above)."

The Act practically removed not only the previous representative system but also the safeguards of independence of the judiciary in that regard.

Having examined all the evidence produced, it found that although the proceedings before the Board could raise doubts as to impartiality (“ jbagħti fl-apparenza ta ’ mparzjalità ”), the proceedings before the PSC could not be in breach of Article 6 since they had respected the principle of audi alteram parte. Nor could it be said that the case had been examined in a hurry in that it focussed solely on whether or not the applicant had been abroad without permission. Although it was unfortunate that the members of the Board who investigated, heard and established facts were also police officers answerable to the CoP, these persons had taken an oath of impartiality before the Attorney General in respect of the specific appointments. The court noted that these were persons who usually would have a lot of experience and who were trusted by the members of the Police Force. As to the PSC, the court held that, although the Constitution provided that the PSC was not obliged to give anyone before it a fair hearing and that the exercise of its functions was not questionable before any court, domestic case ‑ law had established that the PSC immunity from judicial action was not absolute and that the PSC had a duty to comply with procedural rules and observe the principles of natural justice, and they could not act ultra vires. The case ‑ law of the Court had also evolved, opening the applicability of Article 6 to police officers in certain cases. However, in the light of the principles established in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II), the present cases did not fulfil the two criteria necessary to make Article 6 applicable. Indeed the charges issued against the applicant called into question “that special bond of trust and loyalty” and the PSC ’ s actions were not subject to any review, thus there was no violation of Article 6."

Lastly under Article 10, the Constitutional Court reiterated that the applicant had failed to request the necessary permission under the written circular issued by the CoP, which he had the right to issue in accordance with Section 108 of the Police Act. According to the Constitutional Court, given the trust associated with the Police Force, the restriction had pursued nearly all the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 § 2. In particular prior authorisation was necessary to safeguard the reputation of the Police Force which was to keep out of public debate so to be consonant with what the Police Force represented. While it was not necessary to examine the content of the interview, a prima facie assessment of such content showed that it had not been consonant with the role of a police officer. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, when the applicant went to Syria to bring back the kidnapped child without the CoP ’ s permission and while she was still a police officer, she had created a delicate situation which could have had repercussions at an international level. Thus, even in the light of the content of the interview the interference in her case had been justified.",

In brief, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive.

One of the key questions in such cases was whether courts in civil proceedings had made any statements imputing criminal liability to individuals who had not been held liable in criminal proceedings ( see Y v. Norway, no. 56568/00, § 42, ECHR 2003 ‑ II (extracts); Diacenco v. Romania, no. 124/04, § 60, 7 February 2012; and Vella v. Malta, no. 69122/10, §§ 55-57, 11 February 2014 )."

It was not alleged, either in the criminal or in the civil proceedings, that the applicant herself had committed any unlawful acts. The present case therefore does not concern her right to the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. Nonetheless, the Court considers that the principles developed in its case-law under that provision (see paragraph 50 above) are of relevance to the present situation."

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in cases involving civil compensation claims lodged by victims, regardless of whether the criminal proceedings ended in discontinuation or acquittal, it has emphasised that while exoneration from criminal liability ought to be respected in civil compensation proceedings, it should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see Vella, cited above, § 56, and the cases cited therein). The Court is of the view that the same principle is applicable in situations such as the present one, in which the applicant ’ s minor son could not be held criminally liable because of his age. Consequently, establishing the applicant ’ s and her son ’ s joint civil liability arising out of the assault in respect of which her son had not been held criminally liable was not in itself incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention. However, the Court will examine whether the civil proceedings were conducted in line with the requirements of a fair hearing set forth in that provision."

In those proceedings he had admitted to having hit the victim but had claimed to have done so in self-defence (see paragraph 8 above). Since A.K. had not been the accused, the courts in the criminal proceedings had not been allowed by law to establish his guilt in respect of any criminal acts (see the relevant domestic law and the case-law of the Supreme Court of Lithuania in paragraphs 30 and 31 above)."

The Klaipėda District Court stated that in the criminal proceedings A.K. had “confessed” and that his “guilt” had been proved; at the same time, it held that “the defendants [had] not provided any facts” challenging A.K. ’ s role in the assault and made a reference to Article 182 § 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows a court to dispense with proving circumstances acknowledged by the parties and therefore does not appear to concern a res judicata effect of judgments adopted in different proceedings (see paragraphs 19 and 35 above). In any event, the decision of the Klaipėda District Court was appealed against, and the Klaipėda Regional Court which examined the appeals made it explicit that in that court ’ s view it was not necessary to carry out a fresh assessment of the applicant ’ s son ’ s role in the assault against V.M. because it had already been established ( see paragraph 23 above; see, mutatis mutandis, Erkol v. Turkey, no. 50172/06, § 41, 19 April 2011). In particular, while the applicant explicitly argued that the judgments given in the criminal proceedings should not have had a res judicata effect in the civil proceedings because they had not concerned her son ’ s criminal liability (see paragraphs 17, 18 and 22 above), the Klaipėda Regional Court rejected that argument. It held that the courts in the criminal proceedings had “established that unlawful actions [had been] committed by the defendant A.K. as well” and that thus, in line with Article 182 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, those actions did not need to be proved (see paragraphs 23 and 35 above)."

France, no. 18851/07, § 41, 12 April 2012, and the cases cited therein). It nonetheless observes that the Supreme Court of Lithuania has held in its case-law that not all facts established in final judgments in criminal proceedings have a res judicata effect in subsequent civil cases. The Supreme Court has ruled that a court examining a civil case does not need to establish afresh the criminal acts, their consequences and whether they were committed by the individual with respect to whom the judgment was given; by contrast, any other facts established in criminal proceedings have been found to not have a res judicata effect in a subsequent civil case (see paragraph 37 above)."

It is established in Paragraph 2 of Article 30 of the Constitution that compensation for material and moral damage inflicted upon a person shall be established by law. Thus, the necessity to compensate material and moral damage inflicted upon a person is a constitutional principle ... This constitutional principle is inseparable from the principle of justice entrenched in the Constitution: all the necessary legal preconditions must be created by law in order to justly compensate for the inflicted damage. Thus, the Constitution imperatively requires to establish by law such legal regulation that a person, who has sustained damage as a result of unlawful actions, would be able in all cases to claim just compensation for that damage and to receive that compensation. ... [It] should be emphasised that it does not follow from the Constitution that it is possible by law to establish some exceptions, under which the moral and/or material damage inflicted upon the person is not compensated, for example, because of the reason that it was inflicted by unlawful actions of officials or institutions of the State itself. If the law, let alone another legal act, established such legal regulation whereby the State would fully or partially avoid the duty to justly compensate for material and/or moral damage inflicted by unlawful actions of the State institution or [its] officials, it would mean not only that the constitutional concept of compensation for damage is disregarded and that this is not line with the Constitution ( inter alia, Paragraph 2 of Article 30 thereof), but it would also undermine the raison d ’ être of the State itself as a common good of the whole society.",

Later that fine had been lifted by civil courts of two instances. The plaintiff in that second set of proceedings before the administrative courts claimed EUR 318 in respect of pecuniary damage caused to him by his legal representation costs – the services of an advocate he had had during the proceedings when contesting the fine.

The Supreme Administrative Court pointed out that even if Article 272 of the Code of Administrative Law Violations provided a right to have an advocate for the person who had been subjected to administrative proceedings, that Code did not stipulate that the representation costs should be compensated. However, when exercising the right to defence, the person could use the paid services of an advocate, and the expenses incurred then should be reimbursed in accordance with the principle “loser pays”. The legal representation expenses, according to their nature, were thus direct losses of a person and, depending on the outcome of the administrative violation case, could be recognised as damage, as set out in Article 6.249 § 1 of the Civil Code."

Accordingly, and notwithstanding that the law did not directly establish the right to reimbursement of legal representation costs by the State to the person who had been subject to proceedings concerning administrative liability, that person retained such a right on the basis of the constitutional principle that the State had to compensate the damage. Lastly, the extent of the pecuniary damage could be assessed and confirmed by the payments made to the advocate.

Accordingly, if significant circumstances were established proving that the person was unable to present the claims regarding “representation costs” and the supporting evidence before the merits of the case were examined, the rule set out in Article 98 § 1 in fine did not apply (for example, this would be so where a case has been terminated in written proceedings about which the parties were not informed, without being decided on the merits – in such a situation it was considered that the parties had had no possibility to present their claims regarding compensation of “representation costs” before the case was examined on the merits).

The Court considers that the applicants ’ complaints do not fall under the notion of “criminal charge” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 1, because they do not meet – neither alternatively, nor cumulatively – the criteria set out in the Court ’ s established case-law, commonly known as the “ Engel criteria” : the legal classification of the offence under national law; the very nature of the offence; and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. In particular, Articles 1 and 44 § 6 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings specifically refer to the Code of Civil Proceedings as regards litigation for lifting fines (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the offences that had been imputed to the applicants had not been classified as criminal under national law – they were of labour law nature and were not punishable by imprisonment. Besides, it has not been argued that the applicants risked imprisonment even if they had failed to pay the fines (see and compare, most recently, Mihalache v. Romania [GC], no. 54012/10, §§ 54-62, 8 July 2019, and the case-law cited therein). That being so, the Court also recalls that the fine imposed on the applicants was based on a provision of the Labour Code (see paragraph 35 above), which regulates relations within, inter alia, private companies, and therefore is not of a purely public law character.

The applicants pointed out that, as was apparent from the domestic courts ’ case-law, neither the Code of Administrative Law Violations nor any other piece of legislation explicitly provided for the possibility of reimbursing legal representation costs incurred by a person in respect of whom an administrative decision had been quashed as unlawful. Nevertheless, case-law acknowledged that the lack of such express regulation could not be used to deprive a person of the right to request compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions of State officials, and that therefore the reimbursement of such legal costs in response to a claim for damages under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code was a reasonable and fair solution. Accordingly, since they had been formally unable to file a claim for the reimbursement of legal costs during the administrative proceedings, they had resorted to the only possible alternative – separate proceedings for damages. In that context, the applicants also referred to the administrative courts ’ case-law establishing the “loser pays” principle. In the applicants ’ case, the fact that the court found the State Labour Inspectorate ’ s decisions unlawful and quashed them meant that the applicants had won the case, and had accordingly acquired, under the doctrine both of the Constitutional Court and of the administrative courts, the right to reimbursement of the legal expenses by the losing party – the State. Any requirement for the winning party to prove any additional clauses to gain the right to reimbursement of litigation costs would contradict not only the “loser pays” principle but also the practice of the Constitutional Court (they referred to the ruling of 19 August 2006, cited in paragraph 26 above). The applicants thus emphasised that any risk of error on the part of public authorities had to be borne by the State itself and that errors could not be dealt with at the expense of the individuals concerned."

It did not prevent them from choosing to be represented by an advocate, inter alia because Article 272 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Law Violations (see paragraph 36 above) entitled them to the legal assistance of an advocate during court proceedings. That right also flowed from the Law on the Bar (see paragraph 31 above), which provided that a person had the right freely to choose the advocate whom he considered the most suitable and reasonable for a particular case. Given that the applicants had been found administratively liable under Article 41 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Law Violations, which concerned specific labour legal relations, they had also chosen a lawyer specialising in labour law, as allowed under Article 6 of the Law on the Bar. Conversely, the State-guaranteed legal aid system did not guarantee the assignment of a lawyer specialising in a specific field of law to the person concerned."

The applicants also disagreed with the Government ’ s suggestion that they should have had recourse to alternative remedies to protect their rights, rather than calling on the services of an advocate (see paragraphs 60 and 61 below). Firstly, the Government ’ s position that they could have chosen not an advocate but a trainee advocate or a person with a university degree in law, did not refute the fact that even in such a situation they would have had to incur legal costs. Moreover, the claim that they could have applied to a lower-skilled specialist, in comparison with an advocate – with higher professional requirements – clearly ran counter to the constitutional right to defend his or her rights in court effectively, rather than declaratively. Secondly, the Government ’ s proposal that the applicants could have applied to the State Labour Inspectorate – with which institution a dispute was pending – for a consultation could only be seen as a “cynical approach” to a person ’ s rights. Thirdly, the mere fact that the applicants did not have to pay court fees for filing a lawsuit did not mean that this in itself was a sufficient effective remedy, or removed their right to conduct the proceedings through a qualified advocate as their representative. Fourthly, the Government had not argued that the litigation costs incurred by the applicants had exceeded the maximum amounts to be awarded according the Ministry of Justice ’ s Recommendations. Even if the costs incurred by the applicants had exceeded those set out in the Recommendations, that would have led to the reduction of the costs awarded to the applicants but not the outright rejection of their claims. It was likewise irrelevant to argue that the applicants could have paid their legal costs in instalments, since this would not have changed their final financial situation."

In the light of the foregoing considerations, the applicants concluded that the Government ’ s position was essentially that an individual, in challenging an unlawful act against him or her in court, rather than ensuring an effective defence, should concentrate on maximising efforts to avoid any legal expenses and related costs disbursable by the State. The fact that the Government ’ s position was based not on legal but exclusively on economic grounds was also clear from their statement that the requirement to reimburse legal expenses in all administrative proceedings would impose a disproportionate financial burden on the State. Obviously, such a situation – restricting an individual ’ s right to recover the costs incurred in court when challenging the unlawful acts of public authorities, with the sole aim of reducing the possible financial burden on the State – was incompatible with the doctrine of the Constitutional Court as well as with the Convention. Moreover, as the Government had acknowledged, the Ministry of Justice ’ s Recommendation set the upper limits on the legal costs awarded by the courts for legal services. This meant that the State ’ s interests in protecting the disproportionately high financial burden associated with the obligation to defray legal expenses to the winner of the case was protected by law, while the latter ’ s right to reimbursement of such costs, as the applicants ’ example showed, was not adequately ensured."

According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, the possibility of reimbursing the litigation costs incurred during the proceedings contesting the administrative violation was not explicitly established in legislation – either the Code of Administrative Law Violations, the Law on Administrative Proceedings, or any other piece of legislation, and either at the time material to the applicants ’ litigation or at the present time. The Government took the view that the applicants, being aware of such legal regulation, had nevertheless deliberately chosen to have an advocate when challenging the State officials ’ actions and to claim the reimbursement of their litigation costs. Yet they must have been aware of a number of other avenues capable of protecting their interests, such as choosing to pay less by electing to be represented not by an advocate but by a trainee advocate or any person who has a university degree in law, since those persons also could represent a client before the administrative courts.

This also covered a possibility to be awarded the litigation costs incurred during the court proceedings seeking to contest such actions. Such a legal regime had also been confirmed by the domestic courts (they referred to the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s decision of 14 July 2011, see paragraph 38 above). However, the Government disagreed with the applicants ’ interpretation of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling of 19 August 2006 (see paragraph 26 above). In fact, the Government considered that the right to compensation for damage inflicted by the actions of State institutions or officials arose only when those actions had been found to be unlawful. This was not the situation in the present case, where the State Labour Inspectorate ’ s decisions had been quashed only on the basis of a different assessment of the factual circumstances concerning the methods of posting work schedules. The courts had not established that the officers of the State Labour Inspectorate had failed to act properly when drawing up the administrative-law violation reports against the applicants. The dismissal of a case of administrative violation of the law could not per se be unequivocally regarded as an acknowledgment of unlawful action on the part of State officials (in support of this argument they referred to the Supreme Administrative Courts ’ ruling cited in paragraph 40 above).

In that case, the Court found the right of access to a court to be an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6, referring to the principles of the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power which underlay much of the Convention. Thus, Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have a claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.

They availed themselves of that option by suing the State Labour Inspectorate, challenging the fines imposed by that entity (see paragraphs 9 and 17 above). That being so, and contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, the Court is not ready to hold that this, of itself, satisfies all the requirements of Article 6 § 1. The Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Zubac v. Croatia [GC], cited above, § 77). The Court finds it reasonable to accept that the applicants ’ intention in going to court was not to participate in court proceedings as an academic exercise, but rather to obtain a result. It refers to the applicants ’ statement that going to court to defend their rights is pointless if in the end they are in a worse situation than they were before litigating (see paragraph 57 above). This was exactly what occurred in this case, since the financial burden on each of the applicants was nearly double or treble that which they had initially faced. Accordingly, and although they enjoyed access to court, the Court finds that the ex post facto refusal to reimburse their costs nevertheless constituted a hindrance of the applicants ’ right of access to court (see, mutatis mutandis, Klauz v.

The Court however shares the applicants ’ view that legal aid as afforded by the State was an individual right and not an obligation that had to be exercised. All the more so, it did not prevent them from choosing to be represented by an advocate (see paragraph 54 above). In this connection, the Court also cannot agree with the Government ’ s suggestion that the applicants should have chosen to be represented by a person of a lesser calibre than an advocate, in order to mitigate the costs. As correctly pointed out by the applicants, this argument as put forward by the Government appears to be primarily based on economic considerations, and disregards both the case-law of the Constitutional Court, which emphasises the importance of the right to have an advocate to defend a person ’ s interests (see paragraph 33 above), as well as the Court ’ s case-law which also highlights the special role of lawyers, as independent professionals, in the administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Correia de Matos v. Portugal [GC], no. 56402/12, § 139, 4 April 2018 ). In this context the Court also refers to the Law on the Bar, which provides that advocates have a right to specialise in a certain field of law. As pointed out by the applicants and not rebutted by the Government, they had advocates of their own choosing specialising in labour law to challenge the lawfulness of the fines imposed on them by the State Labour Inspectorate, and the success of the applicants ’ appeals may be regarded as an indication that their decision to engage advocates was vindicated (see paragraphs 9, 17 and 54 above)."

Next, the Court turns to the Government ’ s suggestion that the applicants were prevented from pursuing their claims under domestic legislation which required, in order to incur State liability and give rise to an obligation to reimburse the claimant ’ s legal costs, the State officials ’ actions to have been unlawful. While recalling that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law and that the Court ’ s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Markovic and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 1398/03, § § 107 and 108, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV), the Court takes note of a number of rulings given by the domestic courts, including the Supreme Administrative Court, which demonstrate that legal costs, although the matter of their compensation is not explicitly regulated in the Code of the Administrative Law Violations, are reimbursed on other legal bases, including the Constitution (see paragraphs 38 in fine, 39 and 44 above). This has also been acknowledged by the Government (see paragraph 62 above). At the same time, the Law on Administrative Proceedings clearly provides that legal costs are determined in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 37 above). The latter Code in turn refers to the principle that the “loser pays”, which has also been relied upon by the administrative courts in a number of cases concerning reimbursement of legal costs of administrative litigation (see paragraphs 34, 40 and 43 above). The Court also notes the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law to the effect that the State should not leave a person in a disadvantageous situation (see paragraph 26 above; as to the principle that the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned, although in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, see Beinarovič and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 70520/10 and 2 others, § 140, 12 June 2018).

On this point, the Court also refers to the applicants ’ argument that they had been formally unable to file a claim for the reimbursement of legal costs during the first set of court proceedings (see paragraph 53 above; for a similar situation and analogous sequence of court proceedings see paragraph 42 above), this argument not having been contested by the Government (see also paragraph 46 above). Indeed, and being careful not to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts, the Court cannot but observe that the applicants ’ claims were rejected not on the basis of Article 98 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for its interpretation by the Supreme Court, see paragraph 46 above), but on the basis of the administrative courts ’ understanding that the State Labour Inspectorate employees ’ actions had not been unlawful."

The Court also cannot ignore the fact that in the present case the administrative courts ’ decisions to deny the applicants any compensation for their legal costs were based solely on their interpretation of the domestic statutory law to the effect that unlawfulness had to be proved on the State ’ s part for such a right to materialise, rather than on the proportionality of those legal costs vis-à-vis the material gain obtained by having the fines lifted (see paragraphs 12, 14, 20 and 22 above). At this juncture, the Court has regard to the Lithuanian courts ’ decisions in other cases, in which they noted that disproportionately high or unjustified legal costs could always have been refused (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above). Such an examination of proportionality is absent in the applicants ’ case. The Court also cannot find, and it has not been suggested, that the litigation costs which the applicants incurred in the instant case were excessive or beyond what the Recommendations by the Ministry of Justice ’ s indicated (see paragraph 55 above). Lastly, it observes that the second applicant showed good faith by referring to the principle of procedural economy, and asking that his case be joined to the first applicant ’ s case so that he would not suffer even more pecuniary losses from litigation costs (see paragraph 19 above), a request which apparently was denied. Against this background the Court therefore finds that, irrespective of whether the domestic courts ’ interpretation of the domestic law in the applicants ’ case was arbitrary (see paragraphs 65 and 67 above), the resulting disproportion created an individual and excessive burden on the applicants."

                "107. Firstly, the Court notes that the domestic law does not explicitly prohibit a two-judge formation. The wording of the above ‑ mentioned section 4 (1a): “he also decides the members and the President” (see paragraph 57 above), does not necessarily imply that a panel always has to be made up of at least three members. In this connection, the Court notes that besides being the president of the panel, the latter was also a member. It is conceivable that only after choosing the members of the panel would the President of the Court for Trusts choose its president, thus, the use of the term “members” in the plural (which also caters for the possibility of having a number of other members), does not in itself exclude a two ‑ judge formation. Moreover, the Court notes that the above-mentioned provision did not oblige the President to provide any reasons for his decision on the composition of the panel, whereas it unambiguously provided that the decision was not amenable to appeal. The Court considers that this in itself does not contravene the Convention. Indeed, the instant case does not refer to a reassignment of judges once proceedings had already started, which may require reasons for such changes and the possibility for applicants to comment (compare Bochan v. Ukraine, no. 7577/02, § 71, 3 May 2007 and Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, § 78, Series A no. 146). The present case concerns the first assignment of a judge to the case in question. Bearing in mind that the applicant ’ s complaint does not concern the impartiality or independence of the assigned judges at that stage of the proceedings, and that the decision was taken within the limits of domestic law, the Court does not find that in determining the composition in the present case the situation was one where the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in such matters was exceeded."

It follows that, in the present case, the Court does not find it established that there was any arbitrariness on the part of the President of the Court for Trusts (compare Biagioli, cited above, § 80)."

The court accepted the applicant ’ s characterisation of the action lodged against B. as a “jactitation suit” aimed at establishing the falsity of the statements that B. had made under oath in the course of the civil proceedings. Addressing the applicant ’ s claim (that he had brought to the court ’ s attention new evidence which had come into his possession after the taking of the “supplementary oath”, or written evidence which he could not submit before, on the basis of which he had initiated the “jactitation suit”), the court found that the applicant had not submitted any such new evidence. Thus, according to the court, the applicant ’ s action should have been rejected on procedural grounds, without the merits of the case being dealt with. Nevertheless, in the court ’ s view, the fact that the parties of the case before it (the applicant and B., the latter in absentia ) were different from the original parties in the “ordinary” civil proceedings (company S.M.I. and B.), allowed the court to consider the “jactitation suit” procedurally admissible, even in the absence of new evidence (that is to say, in the absence of the prerequisites for the admissibility of a “jactitation suit” as established by the domestic case-law, see paragraph 68 below). The court justified its decision not to follow the above-mentioned precedent on the basis that the final judgment in the “ordinary” civil proceedings had to be considered “ res inter alios acta ” (a thing involving and affecting different parties)."

However, the court held that what he had said under the second part of the “supplementary oath” (relating to the final amount due) had been true. It dismissed the applicant ’ s request to reduce the amount of the debt and confirmed that company S.M.I. had to pay B. the same sum of money."

According to the court, the wording of the “supplementary oath” did not imply that the second part had to be seen as a consequence of the first part, despite the use of the word “thus” ( per cui ). It was therefore preferable to separate the two parts, since operations could have existed which may not have had any effect on the amount of the final balance."

In connection with the first part, the court noted that the authorisation of the mandator (in this case, B.) to use the proceeds obtained from a certain financial operation in order to pay off an obligation arising from the same operation (as had happened in the case at hand) had to be considered implicit in a contract of mandate. This was a “natural effect” of the contract. It followed that the first part of the “supplementary oath” ( in which B. had stated that the only operations which had been authorised were those listed by B. ’ s legal representative) had not been exact and the applicant was thus right on that point and the first part of the “supplementary oath” had to be considered false."

In any case, having examined all the evidence, in the court ’ s view, the declaration of falsity of the first part of the statement made by B. under oath did not necessarily impact upon the quantification of the debt since ( i ) all the parties to the contract of 20 March 1990 had acted under the instructions of the same mastermind (B.), (ii) company P.A. (the seller of the shares of company A.N., from which company S.M.I. had taken over the debt owed to bank S. – see paragraph 10 above) belonged to company S.M.I., and (iii) bank S. had not even been notified of the taking over of the debt. Thus, there was no risk that company S.M.I. had to actually pay the debt.

According to the applicant, his “jactitation suit” had aimed at ascertaining the existence of actual damage arising from the falsity of the “supplementary oath” and such damage had arisen from the second part of the “supplementary oath” (the one in which B. had claimed the return of a quantified sum) and not the first part. Furthermore, the two parts of the “supplementary oath” had to be considered strictly connected. Thus, the finding that the first part of the “supplementary oath” had been false should have also automatically led to a declaration of falsity of the second part since between them a logical causal link ( nesso logico di causalita ) existed. In addition, the decision to split the “supplementary oath” into two parts had not been reasoned and, in the applicant ’ s view, he needed not bring any proof of the non ‑ existence of the debt, it being an automatic result of the falsity of the statement given on oath."

The “supplementary oath” can be requested by means of an interlocutory discretionary decision of the judge in order to decide the case if the facts were not fully established at the probative stage. According to domestic case-law and legal literature, a “supplementary oath” is only admissible in the case of a partial lack of evidence ( semiplena probatio ) and should preferably be requested from the party who partially gave evidence of his or her statement in the course of the proceedings. The factual findings which derive from statements made under oath cannot be examined any further by the judge.

According to the domestic practice, the only admissible ways to contrast the factual findings arising from statements made under oath are: ( i ) a declaration of falsity in criminal proceedings for perjury (“false oath” - Article 359 of the Criminal Code), and (ii) the submission of new evidence concerning facts of which the party had knowledge after the taking of the oath or written evidence which would have been impossible to submit earlier (“jactitation suit” ‑ azione di iattanza )."

The aim of the action is to obtain a declaration of falsity of statements made by the counterparty and “the cessation of the slander”. The interest in bringing proceedings exists if the alleged false statements of the defendant have damaged the reputation ( buon nome ), status, rights or patrimony of the plaintiff. In the course of the civil proceedings the defendant has to demonstrate that his statements were true.

However, the Court considers that the proceedings before the Court for Trusts were instead a different and autonomous civil action, which had to determine a different main issue i.e., whether B. had lied under oath, and then consequently, whether the sums, which S.M.I. had been ordered to pay in the civil proceedings, be diminished or set ‑ off. Moreover, while the proceedings before the Court for Trusts concerned the same set of facts, they had been brought by a different party (the applicant in his own name instead of company S.M.I.). Most importantly, even had it been considered as a “reopening”, which is not the case, the Court notes that, while the applicant had been successful in part, the final outcome of the proceedings before the Court for Trusts had no impact on the impugned decision in the ordinary civil proceedings and did not lead to a reopening of those proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis and a contrario, Dicle and Sadak v. Turkey, no. 48621/07, § 55, 16 June 2015 ), nor did they consist of a review of that decision (see, a contrario, Sapeyan, cited above, § 24). Thus, in any event, the decision in the “jactitation suit” brought by the applicant before the Court for Trusts cannot be considered an exception to the rule mentioned in paragraph 79 above. It follows that the starting point for the running of the six-month rule is the final judgment of the Court of Appeal of 9 June 2011 which was filed with the registry on 30 June 2011 and served on the applicant on 20 July 2011 (see paragraph 21 above)."

The wording of the above ‑ mentioned section 4 (1a): “he also decides the members and the President” (see paragraph 57 above), does not necessarily imply that a panel always has to be made up of at least three members. In this connection, the Court notes that besides being the president of the panel, the latter was also a member. It is conceivable that only after choosing the members of the panel would the President of the Court for Trusts choose its president, thus, the use of the term “members” in the plural (which also caters for the possibility of having a number of other members), does not in itself exclude a two ‑ judge formation. Moreover, the Court notes that the above-mentioned provision did not oblige the President to provide any reasons for his decision on the composition of the panel, whereas it unambiguously provided that the decision was not amenable to appeal. The Court considers that this in itself does not contravene the Convention. Indeed, the instant case does not refer to a reassignment of judges once proceedings had already started, which may require reasons for such changes and the possibility for applicants to comment (compare Bochan v. Ukraine, no. 7577/02, § 71, 3 May 2007 and Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, § 78, Series A no. 146). The present case concerns the first assignment of a judge to the case in question. Bearing in mind that the applicant ’ s complaint does not concern the impartiality or independence of the assigned judges at that stage of the proceedings, and that the decision was taken within the limits of domestic law, the Court does not find that in determining the composition in the present case the situation was one where the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in such matters was exceeded."

Albania, no. 3738/02, §§ 118 ‑ 22, 18 December 2007), in the circumstances of the present case, the fact that it was decided unanimously, does not impinge on the majority rule, and does not lead to an incompatibility with domestic law."

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, § 146; Denisov, § 62; and Micallef, § 95; all cited above)."

Also, in the Court ’ s view, the scope of the examination as to whether or not to grant leave to appeal against the decision of the Court for Trusts, did not amount to an assessment of the merits of the appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.B. v. the United Kingdom, ( dec. ), no. 37120/97, ECHR 16 January 2007, and Central Mediterranean Development Corporation Limited v.

While it is true that the judge expressed his opinion as to the approach taken by the Court for Trusts for assessing the “supplementary oath” (see paragraph 55 above), that consideration, which went beyond the scope of the review requested from him, can nevertheless be considered to be one not affecting the actual merits of the case decided in the criminal proceedings, namely the truth or not of the statement made under oath.

They explained that its purpose was to ensure that only those appeals deserving to be heard were selected, to ensure an efficient allocation of judicial resources. Moreover, it had to be noted that often appeal proceedings ended up being de facto second proceedings, which were not justified since they were not instituted immediately after the gathering of evidence. They pointed out that, in this connection, the domestic law was definitely in line with the legislation in force in other European and non ‑ European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, the United States of America and Canada. In particular, under the law applicable in the United Kingdom, in order to lodge an appeal before the civil division of the Court of Appeal against decisions of local or higher courts, prior permission of the judge was necessary. Moreover, the judge was not obliged to grant such leave, the latter being granted only when strong reasons existed as to why the appeal should be heard or when the judge considered that the appellant had a real chance of success. Relying on the case Dobrić v. Serbia (nos. 2611/07 and 15276/07, 21 June 2011) the Government considered that leave to appeal a judgment of the Court for Trusts had the legitimate aim of providing for a simplified procedure to deal with appeals without a reasonable chance of success and to rationally allocate judicial resources."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 230, ECHR 2012). In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court ’ s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.

That fact was established by the President of the Court for Trusts (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above) and confirmed by the Judge of Civil Appeals (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above) in, moreover, fully reasoned decisions. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case ‑ law, the fact that an appeal lies only when it is certified by a court that the decision appealed against involved a point of law does not, as such, amount to an unjustified denial of right of access to a court (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.B. v. the United Kingdom, ( dec. )., cited above). In the present case, the Court is satisfied that the limitation on the admissibility of appeals on points of law in civil cases before the Court for Trusts pursues a legitimate aim, namely the effective and speedy administration of justice. The Court further accepts that the manner in which that limitation is set out in section 11 (1 and 2) of Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013 is within the State ’ s margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Valchev and Others, cited above, § 87). Finally, bearing in mind that the applicant had been able to request a criminal investigation which in fact ensued, as well as the fact that the applicant ’ s claim had already been examined by the first ‑ instance Court for Trusts, having full jurisdiction, three years after the end of the original proceedings giving rise to the applicant ’ s complaint, the Court cannot find that the restriction was disproportionate or that it impaired the very essence of the applicant ’ s right to a court."

In this connection, the applicant noted that the President had only adopted criteria for calculating the legal costs of proceedings before the Court for Trusts in a decree of 10 September 2015, when the proceedings concerning him had already begun. He alleged that in his case the President of the Court for Trusts had established the amount of costs payable without referring to any pre-set criteria and relying uniquely on his discretion.

As to accessibility, the Government noted that Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013 (see paragraph 57 above) had been circulated in line with the ordinary procedure for the publication of laws, which required not only the posting of the legislative texts in the Government building but also their publication in the Official Gazette ( Bollettino Ufficiale ) and on Parliament ’ s website, the latter being permanently accessible to anyone. The predictability of such a general provision had been further ensured through the adoption of the Rules of 2 February 2014 by the President of the Court for Trusts. Both those rules and subsequent rules adopted by the President of the Court for Trusts on 10 September 2015 had been published on the website of the court, in a section specifically devoted to legislation and regulatory measures. Therefore, all the relevant law and regulations had been constantly accessible and ( i ) had provided for precise criteria concerning the calculation of legal costs before the Court for Trusts; (ii) had linked the amount of such costs with the value of a given claim and the costs normally paid by the State for the remuneration and expenses of judges, as well as court fees; and (iii) had required that part of the legal costs be paid in advance. In the light of the content of that legislation, the Government considered that the applicant had been perfectly able to foresee the economic burden of the proceedings before the Court for Trusts, thus, according to the Government, the relevant legal basis, from a qualitative point of view, had also been predictable. Moreover, the costs payable had been proportionate to the high value of the claim (approximately EUR 4,662,778.93)."

In this connection, the Court notes that section 2 (2b) of Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013 (see paragraph 57 above) provides that to avoid the claim being barred, an application must be filed with the registry together with evidence of payment of court fees in the amount periodically determined by the President and, in general, also calculated on the basis of the value of the claim. In addition, section 4 (1b and c) of the same law (see paragraph 57 above) provide that, at the beginning of the proceedings, the President decides, by a final decision not amenable to appeal, the amount of the variable part of the remuneration of the single judge or panel and the amount of legal fees (which can vary depending on the complexity of the case and/or its value). Moreover, pursuant to that same provision, the applicant must pay, within seven days, to avoid the claim being barred, a part thereof, which is calculated in relation to the total amount of remuneration and expenses payable to the judges. Such a sum is determined by the President applying a variable increase between 10 and 20% to the cost incurred by the State for the remuneration and expenses payable to judges, as well as court fees."

Indeed, these rules had not been issued prior to the applicant lodging his claim. Thus, the President, in calculating the legal costs and expenses in the specific case of the applicant, relied on a detailed series of criteria which he had established himself the day before in his (administrative) capacity as President of the Court for Trusts. In this connection, however, the Court considers that such criteria were perfectly in line with the above-mentioned sections 2 (2b) and 4 (1b and c) of Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013, which, as stated above, constituted the more general legal basis of the President ’ s request to the applicant to pay, in advance, legal costs and expenses.

However, the Commission has serious doubts about the reform model chosen, which concentrates these very large competences in the hand of one individual person, the President of the newly established National Judicial Office (NJO) [8].",
                "States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when establishing a system for the administration of justice and a variety of models exist in Europe. However, in none of the member states of the Council of Europe have such important powers been vested in a single person, lacking sufficient democratic accountability. In countries where the Minister for Justice appoints judges, the Minister is directly accountable to Parliament, has a shorter mandate and tends to be personally involved only in the most important cases.",
                "Even if most of the competences of the President of the NJO do not relate to decision-making in individual cases, many of the powers listed above are closely related to the position of the judge who makes these decisions. The President of the NJO is not only a strong court “administrator”, he or she also intervenes very closely in judicial decision making through the right of transferring cases to another court, his or her influence on individual judges and on the internal structure of the judiciary.",
                "In contrast, the President of the NJO has abundant competences and, hence, is the main actor in judicial administration. However, the mere fact that only judges are eligible as President of the NJO, does not make the latter an organ of judicial self-government. Instead, this would imply that the judges have a decisive vote in his/her election. Since the President of the NJO is elected by Parliament, i.e. an external actor from the viewpoint of the judiciary, it cannot be regarded as an organ of judicial self-government.",
                "The allocation of cases is one of the elements of crucial importance for the impartiality of the courts. With respect to the allocation of cases, the Venice Commission - in line with Council of Europe standards [9] - holds that “the allocation of cases to individual judges should be based on objective and transparent criteria established in advance by the law. [10] According to the ECtHR ’ s case-law, the object of the term “established by law” in Article 6 ECHR is to ensure “that the judicial organisation in a democratic society [does] not depend on the discretion of the Executive, but that it [is] regulated by law emanating from Parliament”. [11] Nor, in countries where the law is codified, can the organisation of the judicial system be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret the relevant national legislation. [12] Together with the express words of Article 6 ECHR, according to which “the medium” through which access to justice under fair hearing should be ensured must not only be a tribunal established by law, but also one which is both “independent” and “impartial” in general and specific terms [ ... ], this implies that the judges or judicial panels entrusted with specific cases should not be selected ad hoc and/or ad personam, but according to objective and transparent criteria. [13]",
                "The order in which the individual judge (or panel of judges) within a court is determined in advance, meaning that it is based on general objective principles, is essential. It is desirable to indicate clearly where the ultimate responsibility for proper case allocation is being placed. In national legislation, it is sometimes provided that the court Presidents should have the power to assign cases among the individual judges. However, this power involves an element of discretion, which could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile cases. It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others. This can be a very effective way of influencing the outcome of the process. [14]",
                "Furthermore, Section 76.4.b AOAC enables the President of the NJO to designate another court based on the vague criterion of “adjudicating cases within a reasonable period of time”. This relates to Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Act on Transitional Provisions of 30 December 2011, which were adopted on the constitutional level in order to overcome the annulment of a similar provision on the legislative level by Constitutional Court judgment no. 166/2011 of 20 December 2011. The Constitutional Court had found that provision contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact, that some courts in Hungary are so small that the designation of such a court would effectively amount to the designation of a single judge or a special chamber, further adds to this. Even though the reasonable time requirement is part of both Article XXVIII Fundamental Law and Article 6.1 ECHR, it is not absolute, but forms a field of tension with the often conflicting right to a fair trial with respect to the fact that having and exercising more procedural rights necessarily goes hand in hand with a longer duration of the proceedings. [15] Taking into account the importance of the right to a lawful judge for a fair trial, the state has to resort to other less intrusive means, in particular to provide for a sufficient number of judges and court staff. Solutions by means of arbitrary designation of another court cannot be justified at all.",
                "In order to prevent the risk of an abuse of the power to allocate and to bring the provisions in line with Article 6 ECHR, the Venice Commission recommends that the Hungarian authorities use other mechanisms for the distribution of cases, especially those outlined by the Venice Commission as follows: “In order to enhance impartiality and independence of the judiciary it is highly recommended that the order in which judges deal with the cases be determined on the basis of general criteria. This can be done for example on the basis of alphabetical order, on the basis of a computerised system or on the basis of objective criteria such as categories of cases. The general rules (including exceptions) should be formulated by the law or by special regulations on the basis of the law, e.g. in court regulations laid down by the presidium or President. It may not always be possible to establish a fully comprehensive abstract system that operates for all cases, leaving no room to decisions regarding allocation in individual cases.",
                "There may be circumstances requiring a need to take into account the workload or the specialisation of judges. ... The criteria for making such decisions by the court President or presidium should, however, be defined in advance [16] on the basis of objective criteria. Workload statistics provide objective statistical data, but they are not sufficient as a basis for the decision on transferral, since they do not contain criteria for the selection of certain cases for transferral or for the selection of the individual receiving court. In order to prevent any risk of abuse, court Presidents and the President of the NJO should not have the discretion to decide which cases should be transferred or to select the ‘ sending ’ or ‘ receiving ’ courts. In addition, any such case allocation should be subject to review in order to take into account possible harsh situations where persons without the means to come to a court that is far away from their home town.",
                "There may therefore be a basis for an objective system (even though it seems that in the present case, the nine cases were not assigned to one of the least burdened courts). The real problem lies in the selection of some cases, which are transferred, and in the lack of any justification, why it was just these cases that were selected. The Commission delegation was indeed informed that one of the cases transferred was a highly sensitive one of alleged political corruption.”"

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 107, 10 September 2010). The application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV). An applicant who has availed himself of a remedy capable of redressing the situation giving rise to the alleged violation, directly and not merely indirectly, is not bound to have recourse to other remedies which would have been available to him but the effectiveness of which is questionable (see Manoussakis and Others v.

The Court therefore considers that the applicant could reasonably expect that a comprehensive constitutional complaint introduced within the statutory time-limit counted from the service of the second-instance decision which includes the reassignment aspect will be entertained by the Constitutional Court as a whole, offering a reply to all the issues with bearing on the fairness of the procedure. For the Court, the fact that the Constitutional Court eventually severed the reassignment decision from the main procedure and sanctioned a different time-limit in that respect was not foreseeable in the least and cannot be reproached to the applicant with the benefit of hindsight."

The reassignment of a case from a court with general territorial competence to another was a well-known legal institution both in Hungarian and other European laws. Reassignments were to be applied only in exceptional cases as a temporary measure with a view to alleviate the serious regional imbalances between the workloads of courts and to eliminate excessive backlogs hindering the conclusion of judicial proceedings within a reasonable time. They took place between courts and not between judges. The assignment of a case to a judge (or to a judicial formation) at the assignee court remained subject to the generally applicable rules governing the allocation of cases, determined by the president of the assignee court in accordance with the law. Therefore, due to the designation of the assignee court in accordance with the law and due to the subsequent allocation of the case to the assignee judge in accordance with the generally applicable rules, the judge having actually proceeded in the applicant ’ s case became a “lawful judge” for the purposes of domestic law."

In any case, the remedies available in the proceedings against the decision given by the assignee court had guaranteed a full review of the case by the Kúria (in review proceedings) and, eventually, by the Constitutional Court (in proceedings instituted for the alleged unconstitutionality of the decision)."

Nevertheless, in many instances it takes into account the “proceedings as a whole”. Thus the Court may find a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention if the proceedings taken as a whole did not satisfy the requirements of a fair hearing even if each procedural defect, taken alone, would not have convinced the Court that the proceedings were “unfair” (see Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v.

Austria, no. 736 0/76, Commission ’ s report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 15, pp. 70-80).

At the same time, “ neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ’ interaction” (see Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 193, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI)."

Poland, no. 54723/00, § 38, ECHR 2005-II). In this latter connection, what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, the parties to the proceedings. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the party to the proceedings is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether the party ’ s doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see, amongst others, Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 38784/97, § 58, ECHR 2002-I; and Miroshnik v. Ukraine, no. 75804/01, § 61, 27 November 2008, with further references).

Austria, 24 February 1993, §§ 28 and 30, Series A no. 255; and Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 42, ECHR 2000-XII)."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others.

The Court refers to the opinion of the Venice Commission according to which the mere fact that only judges are eligible to be elected President of the NJO does not render the latter an organ of judicial self-government (see paragraph 26 above). Moreover, the Court cannot overlook the fact that until 17 September 2012 there had been no criteria at all in place that could, in principle, contribute to an objective reassignment (see paragraph 12 above). Although the National Judicial Council determined the applicable principles on that date, it did not provide any criteria for the selection of the individual cases to be reassigned, but granted discretion to the President of the NJO in the choice between eligible assignee courts. In any event, the introduction of the selection criteria was immaterial in the present case, since the assignee High Court had given judgment earlier, on 5 June 2012; and by 18 September 2012 the Pécs Court of Appeal, whose competence had also been determined by the assignment of the case to the Zalaegerszeg High Court, terminated the appeal procedure."

Having examined all the evidence produced, it found that although the proceedings before the Board could raise doubts as to impartiality (“ jbagħti fl-apparenza ta ’ mparzjalità ”), the proceedings before the PSC could not be in breach of Article 6 since they had respected the principle of audi alteram parte. Nor could it be said that the case had been examined in a hurry in that it focussed solely on whether or not the applicant had been abroad without permission. Although it was unfortunate that the members of the Board who investigated, heard and established facts were also police officers answerable to the CoP, these persons had taken an oath of impartiality before the Attorney General in respect of the specific appointments. The court noted that these were persons who usually would have a lot of experience and who were trusted by the members of the Police Force. As to the PSC, the court held that, although the Constitution provided that the PSC was not obliged to give anyone before it a fair hearing and that the exercise of its functions was not questionable before any court, domestic case ‑ law had established that the PSC immunity from judicial action was not absolute and that the PSC had a duty to comply with procedural rules and observe the principles of natural justice, and they could not act ultra vires. The case ‑ law of the Court had also evolved, opening the applicability of Article 6 to police officers in certain cases. However, in the light of the principles established in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II), the present cases did not fulfil the two criteria necessary to make Article 6 applicable. Indeed the charges issued against the applicant called into question “that special bond of trust and loyalty” and the PSC ’ s actions were not subject to any review, thus there was no violation of Article 6."

A mere requirement that an officer who was suspended from office had to request permission to travel during the suspension - a rule the applicant was aware of when she joined the Police Force - could not be considered disproportionate."

Lastly under Article 10, the Constitutional Court reiterated that the applicant had failed to request the necessary permission under the written circular issued by the CoP, which he had the right to issue in accordance with Section 108 of the Police Act. According to the Constitutional Court, given the trust associated with the Police Force, the restriction had pursued nearly all the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 § 2. In particular prior authorisation was necessary to safeguard the reputation of the Police Force which was to keep out of public debate so to be consonant with what the Police Force represented. While it was not necessary to examine the content of the interview, a prima facie assessment of such content showed that it had not been consonant with the role of a police officer. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, when the applicant went to Syria to bring back the kidnapped child without the CoP ’ s permission and while she was still a police officer, she had created a delicate situation which could have had repercussions at an international level. Thus, even in the light of the content of the interview the interference in her case had been justified.",

In brief, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive.

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, inter alia, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brumărescu v.

Higher courts ’ powers of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

This resulted in nullifying the legal effects of those judicial acts, although formally they still remained in force. The Court finds, therefore, that the decision of the Civil Court of Appeal of 15 September 2006 as upheld by the Court of Cassation on 2 March 2007 set at naught an entire judicial process which had ended in judicial decisions that were “irreversible” and thus res judicata and which moreover had been executed (see, mutatis mutandis, Brumărescu, cited above, § 62).

However, taking into account the importance of the principle of judicial impartiality (see Buscemi v Italy, no. 29569/95, § 67, ECHR 1999-VI), judges enquiring into the parties ’ willingness to enter into friendly settlements must exercise caution and refrain from using language that may, assessed objectively, justify that either of the parties legitimately fears that the judge in question lacks impartiality."

The Court also notes that the first applicant had become hospitalised for acute reasons just during the night before the hearing, and that it does not appear that his representative had in fact had adequate notice or opportunity to represent the applicant at the hearing but failed to do so. Under such circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicant was in fact deprived of any representation before the Court of Appeal and therefore, for reasons which could not be imputed to him, was unable to comment on the submissions of the representative of his opponent (see Ternovskis v. Latvia, no. 33637/02, §§ 69-75, 29 April 2014)."

The High Court ’ s role in appeal proceedings in a civil case was not to examine the case afresh but to review the first-instance court ’ s decision that formed the subject of the appeal. After carrying out an examination of the merits of the case, normally on the basis of the case file, the High Court could refuse admission of an appeal provided that it found it “clear” that the appeal had no prospects of success. This requirement implied a high degree of certainty that the outcome would remain unaltered after an ordinary appeal hearing. It was not a condition for refusing admission of an appeal that the High Court agreed with the City Court ’ s reasoning or was of the view that its reasoning would stand after the High Court ’ s review of the case. It was sufficient that the High Court found it clear that the outcome would be maintained, possibly on the basis of a different reasoning than that given by the City Court. It was moreover a condition that the three judges taking part in the decision to refuse admission of an appeal unanimously found that the appeal would not succeed ( see paragraph 29 above ). A decision to refuse admission of an appeal was taken at the preparatory stage of the proceedings (Article 29-14) and, once final, had the effect that the lower court ’ s judgment gained legal force (see paragraph 28 above)."

Poland (dec.), no. 38308/05, 1 September 2009, cited above, both with further references ).

The Court is not convinced in the concrete circumstances that the High Court ’ s reasoning in its decision of 12 June 2008 did address the essence of the issue to be decided by it (compare, mutatis mutandis, Helle, cited above, § 60) in a manner that adequately reflected its role at the relevant procedural stage as an appellate court entrusted with full jurisdiction and that it did so with due regard to the applicant ’ s interests (see Monnell and Morris, cited above, § 56)."

Furthermore, it should be noted that when refusing to admit the applicant ’ s appeal, the High Court did not act as the final instance in so far as its procedure could form the subject of an appeal to the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court. Whilst the latter ’ s jurisdiction did not extend to the merits of the applicant ’ s appeal to the High Court or of the latter ’ s refusal to admit his appeal (compare Hadjianastassiou, cited above, § 33; and Hirvisaari, cited above, §§ 31-32), its review did encompass the High Court ’ s application of the law and assessment of the evidence in as much as it related to points of procedure. It could also review whether in the light of the High Court procedure, seen as a whole, it was justifiable from a fair hearing point of view, notably the guarantees in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal. This review included whether the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure (see paragraph 38 above). Against this background, the Court cannot but welcome the developments in national judicial practice (see paragraph 44 and also paragraph 35 above) and the legislative changes (see paragraphs 45 to 46 above) in this area after the impugned proceedings. Thus, while the said review would be based on the same case-material as before the High Court (see paragraph 39 above), the Court is not persuaded that the reasons stated by the High Court for refusing to admit his appeal made it possible for the applicant to exercise effectively his right to appeal (see Hadjianastassiou, cited above, § 33; Hirvisaari, cited above, § 30) against the High Court ’ s procedure to the Supreme Court, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

In the case that had previously been decided by the City Court on 4 April 2001, the subject-matter of the dispute had been whether the marital agreements from 1990 and 1995 were valid. The subject-matter in the present case was different. Two spouses having completely separate property had the opportunity to conclude a mutual agreement involving an obligation of performance for each party. According to legal doctrine, such a contract was not dependent on any condition as to form.",
                "(b) The contract had been a reality in the present case. Ekheim Invest had purchased the half of the Ekheim estate that had been in Mrs B. ’ s ownership, not the half owned by the applicant, because Mrs B. had had no right to sell the other half. Consequently, Ekheim Invest ought to transfer by deed of conveyance half of the Ekheim estate back to the applicant.",
                "(c) The applicant further submitted that in its 2001 judgment the City Court had not reviewed the validity of the joint ownership agreement. In any event, the legal force of that judgment extended only to the relationship between Mrs B. and the applicant, not between Ekheim Invest and the applicant. The applicant referred to legal doctrine, according to which a judgment as a main rule only had legal force in the relationship between the parties to the proceedings. Moreover, the parties ’ arguments ought to be taken as a starting point in the assessment of whether any new factual circumstances had arisen.",
                "(d) The applicant ’ s argument was that in the period since 2001 the estate had increased so greatly in value that the City Court now had to assess the ownership issue independently of the conclusion reached in the 2001 judgment. At that time the mortgages on the property had clearly exceeded its value and it had therefore been unproblematic to hold that, in light of an on - going bankruptcy at the time, the applicant would not have been in a better position in the absence of the marriage settlement agreements. It would be unreasonable if Mrs B. or her successors should be able to profit from the tremendous increase in the property ’ s value."

In the present case, the judgment of the [High] Court ... does not provide any substantive reason at all as to why the court determined that it was clear that the appeal would not succeed, which puts into question the existence of a substantial review of the author ’ s conviction and sentence. The Committee considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the lack of a duly reasoned judgment, even if in brief form, providing a justification for the court ’ s decision that the appeal would be unsuccessful, impairs the effective exercise of the right to have one ’ s conviction reviewed as required by article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant.”",

It concluded that from Article 14 § 5 of the Covenant it followed that every High Court decision refusing admission of an appeal under Article 321 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ought to be reasoned. It further held that this requirement ought to be considered part of Norwegian national law (section 3 of the Norwegian Human Rights Act)."

Firstly, it stressed that reasons must be provided in order to ensure the efficiency of the High Court ’ s review. Omitting to provide reasons “impair[ed] the effective exercise of the right to have one ’ s conviction reviewed”. The requirement of reasons was a necessary safeguard for ensuring a substantial review. By requiring the court to explain why the appeal would not succeed, one could ensure that the decision was reached on the basis of a thorough and sound assessment."

The Supreme Court held that this was relevant for the appellant – the reason for the refusal should enable the appellant to verify that the issues raised in the appeal had been properly assessed. In addition, it was relevant for the superior review body, where such existed. Where the law provided that the decision of the appellate instance could be appealed against to a superior body, the decision of the appellate body ought to be reasoned in such a manner as to enable review of the decision."

As to the extent to which reasoning was required, the Supreme Court observed that as a starting point, the reasoning should include what was needed to show that a substantial review had taken place. Usually, such reasoning could be done summarily, in a brief and succinct form, and be linked to the submissions in the appeal. The reasoning should show that the alleged errors in the first-instance court ’ s decision had been understood and why the appeal clearly would not succeed. This meant that it would be insufficient, as had been done previously, to state the grounds for appeal and paraphrase the statutory requirement for refusing admission of an appeal. In this connection the reasoning should be formulated with a view to enabling the Supreme Court to review the High Court procedure, including whether a substantial review had been carried out as required by Article 14 (5) of the Covenant. The extent of the reasoning required would vary considerably, depending on the nature of the particular case, ranging from a couple of sentences to more extensive reasoning of a legal or factual character."

Whilst a system giving the High Court the final say on questions of law would be at odds with this provision, one that limited the right to appeal against the assessment of evidence would not. However, a filtering system for appeals would not as such be incompatible with Article 88.

The Supreme Court ’ s competence to review the High Court procedure encompassed questions of whether a breach had occurred of expressly stated rules of procedure. The Supreme Court was empowered to fully examine the application of the law and the assessment of the evidence in relation to questions of procedure and, if necessary, determine whether an error of procedure had materialised (see NOU 2001:32 p. 777, Rt. 2008 p. 1317; Rt. 2009 p. 222 and Rt. 2009 p. 411 ).

Article 1-1 (1), setting out the Code ’ s general purpose to guarantee a fair hearing, and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. This also covered whether in the light of the points of law raised in the case was justifiable for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal ( Rt. 2002 p. 1032). The Supreme Court could in addition review whether the state of the evidence before the High Court suggested that the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure. The majority further emphasised that, in assessing whether in view of the points of law raised in the case was justifiable for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal, regard could be had to whether the case raised issues of constitutional law or questions regarding Norway ’ s international legal obligations or whether the High Court should have admitted the appeal in the interest of legal unity, clarification or development of the law, with a possibility for lodging an ordinary appeal to the Supreme Court.

The dispute was genuine and serious; it related not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (ibid.). The Court further observes that the City Court rejected the applicant ’ s claim on the ground that the company had derived his rights from the applicant ’ s former wife and that the City Court had previously ruled in her favour in its 2001 judgment. The City Court ’ s 2008 judgment must be considered to have determined the dispute since, following the High Court ’ s refusal to admit the appeal, the result of these proceedings seen as a whole was directly decisive for the right in question (ibid.). Article 6 § 1 was accordingly applicable to those proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, the Court is aware that, as noted in Valchev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.) nos. 47450/11, 26659/12 and 53966/12, 21 January 2014), there have been cases in which such proceedings were found not to involve a “determination” of the applicant ’ s “civil rights” and the provision was therefore considered inapplicable (ibid., § 72).

In the present case, a number of factors spoke in favour of requiring the High Court to state adequate reasons and for rejecting the Government ’ s invitation to the Court to rely on its previous rulings in which it had accepted that appellate courts give limited or even no reasoning when rejecting an appeal :",
                "(i) The case-law in question was very specific and had been limited to dealing with decisions taken by national supreme- or constitutional courts or similar tribunals of last and final jurisdiction, with inherent features suggesting a more lenient duty to state reasons (see for instance, X v. Germany, (dec.) no. 8769/79, 16 July 1981; Müller -Eberstein v. Germany (dec.), no. 29753/96, 27 November 1996; Immeubles Groupe Kosser v. France (dec.), no. 38748/97, 9 March 1999; Bufferne v.

Norway (dec.), no. 20087/92, 26 October 1995).",
                "(ii) That case-law had generally concerned situations where the merits of the case had been thoroughly assessed in two lower instances and where a reduced requirement for stating reasons in the last and final instance refusing the appeal had been justified. However, the merits of the present case had not been thoroughly assessed even once. Although the City Court had accepted to hear the case on the merits ( thus accepting that the 2001 proceedings were not legally binding on the 2008 proceedings ), it had considerably restricted the scope of the hearing by not allowing the applicant to examine any witnesses or present any other evidence, thereby generally preventing him from putting forth his arguments. Despite his having pointed to these errors in his appeal (see paragraph 11 above), the High Court had failed to hear oral argument and to take any steps to rectify them. All it did before rejecting the appeal was to obtain one set of written pleadings from the applicant (who was not represented by counsel at the domestic level ). Thus, a strict requirement ought clearly to apply to the High Court ’ s reasoning.",
                "(iii) Whereas the above case-law commonly related to provisions offering a court of last and final jurisdiction the possibility of granting leave to appeal, the present case concerned a situation where the legislator had opted for a provision offering the applicant a right to appeal to the High Court (Article 29-13 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure). This was presumably on the ground that the former type of appeal scheme (which was the rule of appeal to the Supreme Court, see Article 30 ‑ 4 (1) of the Code ) would offer insufficient legal protection where the case had only been reviewed once, at first instance.",
                "(iv) While the said case-law had generally concerned appeals limited to questions of law, as was common for appeals to a court of last and final jurisdiction, an appeal to the High Court, as was the situation here, could concern questions of fact, law and procedure (Article 29-3 (1) of the Code). Since the High Court failed to state any reasons for its decision it was impossible to understand why it had found it “clear that the appeal will not succeed” (Article 29-13 (2) of the Code).",
                "(v) The aforementioned case-law commonly concerned situations where the decision in question could not itself form the subject of a further appeal and the need for reasoning was accordingly more limited. In contrast, in the case at hand, the High Court ’ s decision was one that could be appealed to the Supreme Court under Article 30-1(1) of the Code but, because it stated no reasons, it would be impossible for the appellate court to review it. Since Norwegian law provided that a High Court decision could be appealed, the decision ought to be reasoned in such a manner as to enable the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court to carry out a review of the High Court procedure. In this context, the applicant prayed in aid the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment (16 December 1992, § 33, Series A no. 252)."

When the three judges comprising the High Court had unanimously stated that they found it clear that the appeal had no prospect of success, it ought to be assumed that their decision had in fact been based on a careful review of the City Court ’ s judgment, the applicant ’ s appeal and three written pleadings.

The Government found no compelling reasons for distinguishing filtering based on a refusal of admission of an appeal (paragraph 2 of Article 29-13 of the Code of Civil Procedure) from the type based on leave-to-appeal procedure (paragraph 1 of the said provision ). Even though they represented two different systems of appeal they both served the same filtering purpose and might produce the same results depending on the circumstances. Were the requirement to provide reasons in the procedure at issue here to be stricter than was the case with regard to leave-to-appeal proceedings, it would have the unfortunate consequence of encouraging States to offer the latter kind which was less furnished with Article 6 guarantees."

Regard must also be had the procedural safeguards that applied when a first instance judgment was appealed. In particular, before delivering its decision the High Court had warned the applicant that it envisaged refusing to admit his appeal and had in accordance with Article 20-13(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure given him an opportunity to comment, of which he availed himself. Thus the procedure conducted by the High Court before taking its decision fully complied with the right to an adversarial process guaranteed by the right to a “fair hearing” in Article 6 § 1 ( see Vermeulen v. Belgium, 20 February 1996, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I )."

Belgium, 17 January 1970, p. 14, Series A no. 11). As to the requirement to state reasons, which is at issue in the case under consideration, in García Ruiz v.

[A] ccording to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see the Ruiz Torija v. Spain and Hiro Balani v. Spain judgments of 9 December 1994, Series A nos. 303-A and 303-B, p. 12, § 29, and pp. 29-30, § 27; and the Higgins and Others v. France judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 60, § 42). Although Article 6 § 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 20, § 61). Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court ’ s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Helle v. Finland judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2930, §§ 59-60).”"

Norway, no. 12148/03, § 49, 4 October 2007 ).

Sweden, 26 May 1988, § 27, Series A no. 134; and Monnell and Morris, cited above, § 56). In order to determine whether the requirements of fairness in Article 6 were met in the present case, it is necessary to consider matters such as the nature of the filtering procedure and its significance in the context of the civil proceedings as a whole, the scope of the powers of the High Court, and the manner in which the applicant ’ s interests were actually presented and protected before the High Court ( Monnell and Morris, cited above, ibid. )."

In his appeal to the High Court, he had complained of the City Court ’ s decision to shorten the overall duration of the hearing from the three days initially scheduled to five hours, including the hearing of the applicant ’ s witnesses and the presentation of documentary evidence, and of the City Court ’ s assessment of the legal issues to be determined."

While it is not the Court ’ s task to express any view on whether the City Court ’ s interpretation of Norwegian law was correct or to substitute its own assessment for that of the City Court with regard to any factual issues brought before it (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247 ‑ B; Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 31, Series A no. 274; and Botten v.

Finland, no. 43803/98, § 31, 8 August 2006; Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 44, 5 July 2007; and Bergsson and Others v. Iceland (dec.), no. 46461/06, 23 September 2008).

It was recognised that in order to avoid that the parties and the judiciary incur considerable additional costs there was a need to stop clearly unmeritorious appeals to the High Court. Whilst the right to appellate review of a decision on the merits was deemed an important safeguard, an unlimited and extensive right in this respect could be counterproductive to the rule of law (see paragraphs 18, 25 and 26 above)."

After carrying out an examination of the merits of the case, normally on the basis of the case file, the High Court could refuse admission of an appeal provided that it found it “clear” that the appeal had no prospects of success. This requirement implied a high degree of certainty that the outcome would remain unaltered after an ordinary appeal hearing. It was not a condition for refusing admission of an appeal that the High Court agreed with the City Court ’ s reasoning or was of the view that its reasoning would stand after the High Court ’ s review of the case. It was sufficient that the High Court found it clear that the outcome would be maintained, possibly on the basis of a different reasoning than that given by the City Court. It was moreover a condition that the three judges taking part in the decision to refuse admission of an appeal unanimously found that the appeal would not succeed ( see paragraph 29 above ). A decision to refuse admission of an appeal was taken at the preparatory stage of the proceedings (Article 29-14) and, once final, had the effect that the lower court ’ s judgment gained legal force (see paragraph 28 above)."

It could also review whether in the light of the High Court procedure, seen as a whole, it was justifiable from a fair hearing point of view, notably the guarantees in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal. This review included whether the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure (see paragraph 38 above).

The Court hence cannot but conclude that, even though the applicant had maintained his position to continue to have sexual contact with V. and even though the District Court had heard him personally throughout the guardianship proceedings (see paragraph 9 above), the issue in the proceedings was not purely legal and technical, but would have allowed the domestic courts to form their own impression of the applicant and the latter to explain his personal situation."

She suffered from a moderate mental disability and from epilepsy. She was highly restricted in her ability to comprehend, concentrate and memorise things, as well as in her sense of orientation. Her ability to communicate was limited to word fragments, which rendered impossible any meaningful communication.

She had no comprehension of sexual relationships, marriage or even her pregnancy. Moreover, owing to the events leading up to her pregnancy, she had become significantly distracted. This state of mind had proved to be temporary, due to her lack of memory and any sense of time.

The court suggested that condition, as it had established that – irrespective of whether it was determined that V. had been able to resist (which required an assessment of whether any consent given by her could be considered to have had legal effect) – it could not be ruled out that the applicant had inevitably erred in his assessment of the legality of his acts. In particular, it could not be ruled out that the applicant was not accountable for relying on the assessment of the public prosecutor of 10 December 2009, according to which it would not be possible to establish that V. was incapable of resisting invitations to engage in sexual intercourse. As a result, criminal liability pursuant to section 179 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 43 below) was ruled out in these proceedings. The Regional Court, however, drew particular attention to the fact that this December 2009 assessment had been proved wrong, given the findings in the present proceedings. It added that criminal liability pursuant to section 174 c § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 43 below) had to be considered as the applicant had taken advantage of the special relationship of confidence between V. and her mother. However, in view of the circumstances and, in particular, the existence of claims for child support and inheritance, the public interest in prosecuting could be satisfied with the payment of the sums indicated to non-profit organisations."

The applicant’s and V.’s child was the result of a severe, massive and illegal violation of V.’s personality rights – not to say the criminal sexual abuse of a person incapable of resistance. V. had been fully incapable of forming the will to resist seemingly friendly suggestions.

The public prosecutor had issued that decision without personally hearing V. and had not commissioned an expert opinion on her. The same was true as regards the Regional Court’s decision to discontinue the second set of criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). In this respect the District Court observed that P.B.’s changing and contradictory allegations also had to be considered. They suggested that, initially, P.B. had rejected the applicant’s sexual advances, so he had subsequently sought sexual relations with V. Moreover it seemed likely that P.B.’s subsequently expressed wish that the parties be allowed to engage in a normal family life (including a wedding) had been rooted in her fear that she and the applicant would be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting the sexual abuse of a person incapable of resistance."

It considered that the decision to impose a contact ban had taken sufficient account of V.’s interests. V. had not wished to have contact with the applicant; her guardian ad litem had also agreed that there was no necessity or purpose – nor any wish on V.’s part – for any written or personal contact with the applicant. Therefore contact with the applicant not only was not in V’s best interest, but would put her interest severely and durably into danger. The District Court noted in this respect that the applicant continued to pursue his intention to abuse V., which would likely lead to further pregnancies and therefore significant further risks for V., since she did not grasp the implications of pregnancy and was unable to give birth without Caesarean section. Having regard to all of the material before it, it concluded that the contact ban was not only necessary, but even imperative.",

It recommended that: all forms of “substituted” decision-making be eliminated and replaced by a system of supported decision-making, in line with the Committee’s General Comment No. 1(2014) on equal recognition before the law; the development of professional-quality standards for supported decision-making mechanisms; and (in close cooperation with persons with disabilities) the provision of training on Article 12 of the Convention, in line with the Committee’s General Comment No. 1, at the federal, regional and local levels for all actors (including civil servants, judges, social workers, health and social services professionals and people from the wider community).",

If fathering a child could establish family life, forced sexual contact could bind two people together as a family and enable someone to attract by coercion the protection afforded by Article 8 of the Convention. V. had not freely chosen to be with him because she had lacked, owing to mental illness, the necessary capacity to do so. The fact that V. lived for some time with the applicant in a common household was not based on a deliberate decision of V. Both happened to live together by chance because the applicant had been P.B.’s partner and had started a common household with her. Moreover, she had subsequently expressed no wish to have any contact with the applicant. The applicant could not unilaterally declare that V. constituted a part of his private life."

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person’s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, with further references, Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 95, 25 September 2018). A broad construction of Article 8 does not mean, however, that it protects every activity a person might seek to engage in with other human beings in order to establish and develop such relationships ( Friend and others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 16072/06 and 27809/08, § 41, 24 November 2009; Gough v. the United Kingdom, no. 49327/11, § 183, 28 October 2014)."

Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII (concerning parents and children); Kruškić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 10140/13, § 111, 25 November 2014 (concerning grandparents and their grandchildren); and Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, 28 September 2000 (regarding prisoners and members of their close family). In the Court’s view private life does not as a rule come into play in situations where a complainant does not enjoy “family life” within the meaning of Article 8 in relation to that person and where the latter does not share the wish for contact. This is all the more so if the person with whom it is wished to maintain contact has been the victim of behaviour which has been deemed detrimental by the domestic courts."

This rule is not limited to reputational damage but has been expanded to a wider principle according to which personal, social, psychological and economic suffering which could be the foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence could not be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounted to an interference with the right to respect for private life. This extended principle covers not only criminal offences but also other misconduct entailing a measure of legal responsibility with foreseeable negative effects on “private life” (see Denisov, cited above, § 98)."

It further observes that the applicant insists on contact with V., whereas the domestic courts established that V. expressed no particular interest in having contact with the applicant. The Court observes moreover that contact between the applicant and V. was deemed to be detrimental for the latter, who showed signs of mental distress and needed medication after his visit to the residential home.

In its decision of 24 May 2012 proposing to discontinue criminal proceedings, the Traunstein Regional Court explicitly pointed out to the applicant and P.B. that V. was to be considered as incapable of resistance (see paragraph 15 above).

With regard to the guardianship case file as a whole the Court is satisfied that the applicant had sufficient knowledge of the expert opinions in relation to V., which must have contained particularly sensitive information and which must at the same time have been of particular importance for the decision to impose a contact ban. The domestic courts had provided the applicant with an earlier ruling containing summaries of the expert opinions, as well as indications as to the conclusions that the court could draw from those opinions in respect of V.’s capacity to consent to the applicant’s intimate advances."

The Court furthermore notes that the case file stemmed from and belonged to a broader framework – namely, the guardianship proceedings with highly personal information relating to V., in particular, information regarding her mental disability adduced during psychological and medical examinations of V. and detailed in expert opinions. The applicable domestic law restricts access to the file in so far as no conflict exists with the serious interests of another participant or of a third party (see paragraph 40 above). It was therefore aimed at protecting the personal data of particularly vulnerable people who are involved in guardianship proceedings in which a contact ban has been issued. There is nothing to indicate that the provision was applied arbitrarily vis-à-vis the applicant."

In proceedings before two instances, at least one instance must, in general, provide such a hearing if no such exceptional circumstances are at hand ( Fröbrich v.

By contrast, it has found the holding of a hearing to be necessary in cases where there was a need to assess whether the facts were correctly established by the authorities, where the circumstances required the court to form its own impression of litigants by affording them a right to explain their personal situation or where the courts needed to obtain clarification on certain points, inter alia, by means of a hearing ( ibid, § 191, with further references)"

As such, the present case can be distinguished from cases where the domestic courts did not provide any reasons why they refused to hold an oral hearing (see Mirovni Inštitut v.

The Court hence cannot but conclude that, even though the applicant had maintained his position to continue to have sexual contact with V. and even though the District Court had heard him personally throughout the guardianship proceedings (see paragraph 9 above), the issue in the proceedings was not purely legal and technical, but would have allowed the domestic courts to form their own impression of the applicant and the latter to explain his personal situation."
