These criteria, sometimes referred to as the “ Engel criteria”, were most recently affirmed by the Grand Chamber in Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom ( [GC] nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003 ‑ X ).",

                "38. The second criterion, the nature of the offence, is the more important. The Court observes that, as in the Janosevic and Bendenoun cases, it may be said that the tax surcharges were imposed by general legal provisions applying to taxpayers generally. It is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that VAT applies to only a limited group with a special status: as in the previously-mentioned cases, the applicant was liable in his capacity as a taxpayer. The fact that he opted for VAT registration for business purposes does not detract from this position. Further, as acknowledged by the Government, the tax surcharges were not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage but as a punishment to deter re-offending. It may therefore be concluded that the surcharges were imposed by a rule whose purpose was deterrent and punitive. The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence. The minor nature of the penalty renders this case different from Janosevic and Bendenoun as regards the third Engel criterion but does not remove the matter from the scope of Article 6. Hence, Article 6 applies under its criminal head notwithstanding the minor nature of the tax surcharge."

Moreover, they were determined by the tax authorities and the administrative courts, and they were in all respects treated differently from court-imposed sanctions. The surcharge in issue in this case was targeted at a given group with a particular status, namely citizens under the obligation to pay VAT and registered as subject to VAT. It was not therefore imposed under a general rule. The main purpose of the surcharges was to protect the fiscal interests of the State and to exert pressure on taxpayers to comply with their legal obligations, to sanction breaches of those obligations, and to prevent re-offending. However this aspect was not decisive. They emphasised that the penalty imposed did not reach the substantial level identified in Bendenoun v. France ( 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284 ). The tax surcharges could not be converted into a prison sentence and the amount of the tax surcharge in the present case was low, 10%, which amounted to the equivalent of EUR 308.80, with an overall maximum surcharge possible of 20 %."

Besides the publicity requirement there were other considerations, including the right to a trial within a reasonable time and the related need for an expeditious handling of the courts ’ caseload, which had to be taken into account in determining the necessity of public hearings in proceedings subsequent to the trial at first-instance level."

They noted that the Administrative Court took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant. An oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case. The issue at hand was rather technical, being based on the report of the tax inspector. Such a dispute could be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. There was nothing to indicate that questions of fact or law would have emerged which could not have been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the written observations of the applicant, the tax inspector and the expert. No additional information could have been gathered by hearing, as required by the applicant, the tax inspector or the expert in person. Furthermore, the applicant was given the possibility of putting forward any views in writing which in his opinion would be decisive for the outcome of the proceedings. He also had the possibility to comment on all the information provided by the tax authorities throughout the proceedings.

The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character ( see Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 54, Series A no. 73; see also Lutz v. Germany, 25 August 1987, § 55, Series A no. 123 ).

These factors may be regarded however in context as relevant in assessing the application of the second and third Engel criteria to the facts of the case, there being no indication that the Court was intending to deviate from previous case-law or to establish separate principles in the tax sphere.

While reference was made to the severity of the actual and potential penalty (a surcharge amounting to 161,261 Swedish kronor (approximately EUR 17,284 ) was involved and there was no upper limit on the surcharges in this case), this was as a separate and additional ground for the criminal characterisation of the offence which had already been established on examination of the nature of the offence ( see Janosevic, §§ 68-69; see also Västberga Taxi Aktiebolag and Vulic v.

The decision, which applied the Bendenoun rather than the Engel criteria, attaches paramount importance to the severity of the penalty to the detriment of the other Bendenoun criteria, in particular that concerning the nature of the offence (and the purpose of the penalty) and makes no reference to the recent Janosevic case. As such, it seems more in keeping with the Commission ’ s approach in Bendenoun v. France ( no. 12547/86, Commission ’ s report of 10 December 1992, unreported ), in which the Commission based the applicability of Article 6 chiefly on the degree of severity of the penalty, unlike the Court in the same case, which weighed up all the aspects of the case in a strictly cumulative approach. Morel is an exception among the reported cases in that it relies on the lack of severity of the penalty as removing the case from the ambit of Article 6, although the other criteria (general rule, not compensatory in nature, deterrent and punitive purpose) had clearly been fulfilled."

Arguments to that effect have also failed in the context of prison disciplinary and minor traffic offences (see, among others, Ezeh and Connors and Öztürk, both cited above). While there is no doubt as to the importance of tax to the effective functioning of the State, the Court is not convinced that removing procedural safeguards in the imposition of punitive penalties in that sphere is necessary to maintain the efficacy of the fiscal system or indeed can be regarded as consonant with the spirit and purpose of the Convention.

            [
                "38. The second criterion, the nature of the offence, is the more important. The Court observes that, as in the Janosevic and Bendenoun cases, it may be said that the tax surcharges were imposed by general legal provisions applying to taxpayers generally. It is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that VAT applies to only a limited group with a special status: as in the previously-mentioned cases, the applicant was liable in his capacity as a taxpayer. The fact that he opted for VAT registration for business purposes does not detract from this position. Further, as acknowledged by the Government, the tax surcharges were not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage but as a punishment to deter re-offending. It may therefore be concluded that the surcharges were imposed by a rule whose purpose was deterrent and punitive. The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence. The minor nature of the penalty renders this case different from Janosevic and Bendenoun as regards the third Engel criterion but does not remove the matter from the scope of Article 6. Hence, Article 6 applies under its criminal head notwithstanding the minor nature of the tax surcharge."

This principle is particularly important in the criminal context, where generally there must be at first instance a tribunal which fully meets the requirements of Article 6 ( see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 - I ), and where an applicant has an entitlement to have his case “ heard ”, with the opportunity, inter alia, to give evidence in his own defence, hear the evidence against him, and examine and cross-examine the witnesses."

There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties ’ submissions and other written materials (see, for example, Döry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, § 37, 12 November 2002, and Pursiheimo v. Finland ( dec. ), no. 57795/00, 25 November 20 03; compare Lundevall v.

The Court has further acknowledged that the national authorities may have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy and found, for example, that the systematic holding of hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social security cases and ultimately prevent compliance with the reasonable - time requirement of Article 6 § 1 ( see Schuler- Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 58, Series A no. 263 and the cases cited therein). Although the earlier cases emphasised that a hearing must be held before a court of first and only instance unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with one (see, for instance, Håkansson and Sturesson, cited above, § 64; Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, §§ 21-22, Series A no. 283-A; and Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, § 46, Reports 1998-I ), the Court has clarified that the character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005). The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, Pélissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, § 52, ECHR 1999- II, and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 90, ECHR 2006- II )."

While it may be noted that the above-mentioned cases in which an oral hearing was not considered necessary concerned proceedings falling under the civil head of Article 6 § 1 and that the requirements of a fair hearing are the most strict in the sphere of criminal law, the Court would not exclude that in the criminal sphere the nature of the issues to be dealt with before the tribunal or court may not require an oral hearing. Notwithstanding the consideration that a certain gravity attaches to criminal proceedings, which are concerned with the allocation of criminal responsibility and the imposition of a punitive and deterrent sanction, it is self-evident that there are criminal cases which do not carry any significant degree of stigma. There are clearly “criminal charges” of differing weight. What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a “criminal charge” by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law, for example administrative penalties ( Öztürk, cited above ), prison disciplinary proceedings ( Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80), customs law ( Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A), competition law ( Société Stenuit v. France, 27 February 1992, Series A no. 232-A), and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters ( Guisset v. France, no. 33933/96, ECHR 2000-IX). Tax surcharges differ from the hard core of criminal law; consequently, the criminal-head guarantees will not necessarily apply with their full stringency (see Bendenoun and Janosevic, § 46 and § 81 respectively, where it was found compatible with Article 6 § 1 for criminal penalties to be imposed, in the first instance, by an administrative or non-judicial body, and, a contrario, Findlay, cited above)."

It is, however, not uncommon for procedures to combine the varying elements and it may not be possible to separate those parts of the proceedings which determine a “ criminal charge ” from those parts which do not. The Court must accordingly consider the proceedings in issue to the extent to which they determined a “criminal charge” against the applicant, although that consideration will necessarily involve the “pure” tax assessment to a certain extent (see Georgiou v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 40042/98, 16 May 2000, and Sträg Datatjänster AB v.

His reasons for requesting a hearing therefore concerned in large part the validity of the tax assessment, which as such fell outside the scope of Article 6, although there was the additional question of whether the applicant ’ s book - keeping had been so deficient as to justify a surcharge. The Administrative Court, which took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant, found in the circumstances that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case."

In that connection, it notes that their characterisation within the domestic legal order is open to different interpretations. In any event, the domestic legal order ’ s characterisation of a penalty cannot, by itself, be decisive for determining whether or not the penalty is criminal in nature. Other factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned, have to be taken into account (see Tyler v. the United Kingdom, application no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77, pp. 81-86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in general, exclusion orders are not classified as criminal within the member States of the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States may also be made by the administrative authorities, constitute a special preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control and do not concern the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant for the purposes of Article 6 § 1. The fact that they are imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot alter their essentially preventive nature. It follows that proceedings for rescission of such measures cannot be regarded as being in the criminal sphere either (see, mutatis mutandis, Renna v.

The exclusion order had been made against the applicant as a result of his failure to comply with an order for his deportation from France and the main issue, therefore, had been his right to stay in France. Accordingly, the measure was based on public-order considerations that did not concern civil law. The Government pointed out that the Commission had consistently expressed the view that proceedings relating to the entry, stay and deportation of aliens were outside the scope of that Article in so far as it concerned disputes over civil rights and obligations, the reason being that the acts in issue in such proceedings were governed by public law and represented the exercise of public-authority prerogatives. The fact that deportation orders generally had pecuniary or family implications for those concerned could not suffice to bring them within the civil limb of Article 6 § 1, as that would mean that all measures concerning immigration control were caught by the scope of that provision since they produced similar consequences for those on whom they were imposed.

Indeed, that observation was supported by the fact that under the laws of most States the administrative authorities were also competent to make such orders, the purpose being not to punish a specific act but to deter foreign nationals from further infringing the legislation on the entry and stay of aliens. The aim of exclusion orders was therefore essentially preventive. It was that special characteristic that made it possible to request the rescission of such orders, no equivalent remedy being available for criminal penalties in the strict sense. Referring to the criteria established by the Court ’ s case-law for determining whether a particular penalty was criminal in character, the Government contended that it appeared clear that an exclusion order could not be regarded as a penalty or as criminal in character for the purposes of the Convention. It was a measure peculiar to immigration control and one far removed from the context of ordinary criminal proceedings."

            [
                "30. The Government observed that in any event, however exclusion orders were classified, and even if they were classified as criminal penalties, it was common ground that proceedings for the rescission of such orders did not entail the court “determining” a criminal charge against the applicant. Such proceedings did not entail any decision by the relevant court on the merits of the charge. The court did not decide whether the applicant was guilty of the offence forming the basis of the exclusion order. Indeed, the arguments generally relied on by applicants when seeking rescission of an exclusion order showed that the debate focused on the applicant ’ s personal circumstances, which, by definition, did not concern the validity of the earlier conviction. The court to which the application for rescission was made merely had to decide whether or not it should remain in effect. Indeed, when applications for rescission were lodged, the applicant was no longer a “person charged” since such applications were precluded unless the conviction had become final. Therefore applications for rescission of exclusion orders did not concern the penalty itself, but its enforcement. That observation had, moreover, led the Commission to express the opinion that the criminal limb of Article 6 § 1 was not applicable to disputes concerning applications for the rescission of such orders."

                "34. The Court points out that, under its case-law, the concepts of “civil rights and obligations” and “criminal charge” cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the domestic law of the respondent State. On several occasions, the Court has affirmed the principle that these concepts are “autonomous”, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, the König v. Germany judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, pp. 29-30, §§ 88-89; the Baraona v. Portugal judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 122, pp. 17-18, § 42; and the Malige v. France judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII, p. 2935, § 34). The Court confirms those principles in the instant case, as it considers that any other solution might lead to results that are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 34, § 81, and the König judgment cited above, pp. 29-30, § 88)."

                "36. The Court points out that the provisions of the Convention must be construed in the light of the entire Convention system, including the Protocols. In that connection, the Court notes that Article 1 of Protocol No. 7, an instrument that was adopted on 22 November 1984 and which France has ratified, contains procedural guarantees applicable to the expulsion of aliens. In addition, the Court observes that the preamble to that instrument refers to the need to take “further steps to ensure the collective enforcement of certain rights and freedoms by means of the Convention ...”. Taken together, those provisions show that the States were aware that Article 6 § 1 did not apply to procedures for the expulsion of aliens and wished to take special measures in that sphere. That construction is supported by the explanatory report on Protocol No. 7 in the section dealing with Article 1, the relevant passages of which read as follows:",
                "“6. In line with the general remark made in the introduction ..., it is stressed that an alien lawfully in the territory of a member state of the Council of Europe already benefits from certain guarantees when a measure of expulsion is taken against him, notably those which are afforded by Articles 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and 8 (right to respect for private and family life), in connection with Article 13 (right to an effective remedy before a national authority) of the ... Convention ..., as interpreted by the European Commission and Court of Human Rights ...",
                "7. Account being taken of the rights which are thus recognised in favour of aliens, the present article has been added to the ... Convention ... in order to afford minimum guarantees to such persons in the event of expulsion from the territory of a Contracting Party. The addition of this article enables protection to be granted in those cases which are not covered by other international instruments and allows such protection to be brought within the purview of the system of control provided for in the ... Convention ...",
                "16. The European Commission of Human Rights has held in the case of Application No. 7729/76 that a decision to deport a person does ‘ not involve a determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him ’ within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The present article does not affect this interpretation of Article 6.”"
            ],
            [
                "37. The Court therefore considers that by adopting Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 containing guarantees specifically concerning proceedings for the expulsion of aliens the States clearly intimated their intention not to include such proceedings within the scope of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "38. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the proceedings for the rescission of the exclusion order, which form the subject matter of the present case, do not concern the determination of a “civil right” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1. The fact that the exclusion order incidentally had major repercussions on the applicant ’ s private and family life or on his prospects of employment cannot suffice to bring those proceedings within the scope of civil rights protected by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Neigel v. France judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 410-11, §§ 43-44, and the Maillard v. France judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1303-04, §§ 39-41)."

                "39. The Court further considers that orders excluding aliens from French territory do not concern the determination of a criminal charge either. In that connection, it notes that their characterisation within the domestic legal order is open to different interpretations. In any event, the domestic legal order ’ s characterisation of a penalty cannot, by itself, be decisive for determining whether or not the penalty is criminal in nature. Other factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned, have to be taken into account (see Tyler v. the United Kingdom, application no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77, pp. 81-86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in general, exclusion orders are not classified as criminal within the member States of the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States may also be made by the administrative authorities, constitute a special preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control and do not concern the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant for the purposes of Article 6 § 1. The fact that they are imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot alter their essentially preventive nature. It follows that proceedings for rescission of such measures cannot be regarded as being in the criminal sphere either (see, mutatis mutandis, Renna v. France, application no. 32809/96, Commission ’ s decision of 26 February 1997, unreported)."

It concentrated on three contracts dated 15 June 1989 between the Brussels Region and “I”. The verbatim record of the interview records this part of the proceedings as follows:",
                "“ Q [ Question ] On 17 May 1989 Mr Javeau sent the private office a draft contract for a preliminary study to be carried out among small and medium-sized businesses in the Brussels area for a total fee of BEF 4,800,000 net of VAT. The study was intended to produce a list of businesses",
                "– operating as sub-contractors;",
                "– receiving subsidies from the Brussels Region.",
                "A few days later you informed Javeau that his draft contract had been transmitted to the administration for scrutiny (appendices 116 to 122 of the same report). Did you have instructions to do that? Did you inform yourself about the possibility of a call for tenders for the creation of such a data bank?",
                "A [ Answer ] I had no instruction to do that. As for finding out about calls for tenders, I left that to the administration, for the reasons I have already mentioned.",
                "Q What is the procedure to be followed where the Treasury inspector's opinion on a draft contract is unfavourable?",
                "A I now know that it was possible to apply to the regional government for arbitration. At the time, I was unaware of that procedure and nobody told me about it. I was determined to get things moving and the opinion of the Treasury inspector, L. in this case, concentrated very much on the regulations and was little concerned with financial viability. In substance, I was irked by the inflexibility and resistance to change of the Treasury inspectorate. In my private office I was advised to do things differently, namely to split the contract into three parts so that the fees would be lower than the BEF 1,250,000 threshold triggering compulsory scrutiny by the Treasury inspector. I must emphasise that, despite doing things that way, I once again submitted the subdivided project to the Treasury inspector, but the second time he gave a favourable opinion.",
                "Q Here you see three contracts signed on 15 June 1989 between the Brussels Region, represented by Minister M., and the “I” association, represented by Mr Javeau (see appendices 100 to 111 of the expert report). Each of these contracts concerns a preliminary study to be carried out among small and medium-sized businesses in the Brussels area to determine which of them would be interested in appearing in a data bank as described in the initial project. Each of these contracts concerns one of the three above-mentioned criteria. They represent a total cost for the preliminary study of BEF 3,600,000 net of VAT, as compared with the initial project, which would have cost BEF 4,800,000 net of VAT. Did not that reduction result from the need to split the initial project into three, since there were three criteria, while at the same time making sure that none of the three contracts exceeded BEF 1,250,000 net of VAT, the threshold for intervention by the Treasury inspector?",
                "A I wish to make it clear that I once again requested the opinion of the Treasury inspectorate even though in each case the fee was below the BEF 1,250,000 threshold. I would also point out that splitting the project into three led to a significant reduction in cost amounting to 25% of the overall fees.",
                "Q Does the fact that Mr Javeau agreed to do the same work for BEF 3,600,000 not show that the initial contract accepted by the private office and the administration was overpriced?",
                "A Your point about the initial price is not wrong, but the agreement on BEF 3,600,000 was probably the result of a tripartite or quadripartite agreement between the private office, the administration, the Treasury inspectorate and “I”. That is a guess, because I can't remember the precise details of that transaction now.",
                "Q Here is the commitment slip for one of the contracts signed with “I” on 15 June 1989. This document bears the signature of Treasury inspector L., dated 30 June 1989, authorising the expenditure. Could Mr L. have opposed implementation of the contract, his opinion not having been sought, it would appear, before it was signed?",
                "A I would observe on this point that I was not obliged to submit the file to Mr L. in view of the size of the fee. But as I was working more with the administration than with the private office, the administration automatically sent the ad hoc expenditure commitment slip to the Treasury inspector for authorisation. In my opinion, Mr L. must have received the contract before it was signed.",
                "Q When these three contracts were received the administration gave them only one commitment number, which was the number of one of them (see appendices 130 and 131 of the same report). Here is another series of documents which indicate that the administrative authorities wrongly thought they were dealing with a single contract, so much so that when “I” sent them three invoices for part-payment of each of the three contracts Mr P. informed Mr Javeau that he thought “I” must have made a mistake. In fact, he requested three original copies of what he believed to be a single invoice and these copies could not bear three different numbers (see appendices 130 to 136 of the same report). So Mr L. could only have authorised expenditure in respect of one commitment slip relating to a single contract?",
                "A Yes, that's true. But it's not my fault. The paperwork was entirely a matter for the administration.",
                "Q As regards approval of expenditure by the Treasury inspectorate in respect of contracts where the fee was lower than its intervention threshold, was it still possible for the inspector to give his views on the advisability of proceeding?",
                "A It is true that from the administrative-law point of view his approval does not seem to be required for the commitment of such sums. However, as far as I am concerned, and in view of my lack of technical experience of budgetary matters, I preferred on all occasions to seek the approval of the Treasury inspector, seeing that for me this represented a guarantee of lawfulness from the Minister's budgetary adviser. Therefore, if Mr L. had formally refused to sign the commitment slip, I would not have gone ahead. You tell me that there is a contradiction between what I am telling you and the splitting of the original project refused by Mr L. My reply is that I was advised to do things that way and that I made sure that Mr L. approved the three new contracts.",

This involved public authorities entering into contracts for the provision of over-priced services so that the provider of the services could transfer a portion of the sums paid to third parties in order to cover the costs of the activities in question. The practices concerned consisted in negotiating and signing contracts for various opinion polls or surveys to be conducted mainly by “I” for the “benefit” of government ministries. The prices stipulated in these contracts were too high in relation to the real cost of the surveys carried out and their likely benefits. In addition, care had been taken to avoid the competitive procedure laid down for contracts entered into by the administrative authorities, which might have prevented “I” from winning some of these contracts, and internal checks carried out by the administrative authorities, mainly by Treasury inspectors, which might have revealed the fact that some of them were over-priced.

At the hearing on 7 February 1996 Mr Stalport filed a pleading arguing that no provision of Belgian law permitted his committal for trial in the Court of Cassation as court of first instance. In a separate pleading he further submitted that there was no connection between the offence he stood accused of and the offence allegedly committed by Mr Coëme. If the Court of Cassation thought otherwise, it should refer a preliminary question to the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court as to whether legal provisions which permitted a defendant who was not a minister to be committed for trial in the Court of Cassation infringed the principles of equality and non-discrimination.

In the reasons for its judgment the Court of Cassation held: “The transitional provision in Article 103 of the Constitution ... applies both to the offences committed after the constitutional revision of 5 May 1993 and to those committed before it”.

I confirm the statements I made at the time of that interview.",

It was that [amount] which caused the unfavourable opinion, and also in part the points of divergence between the opinions of the administration and the Treasury inspectorate.",

I do not think the solution of splitting into three was adopted to evade Treasury scrutiny. If we had followed the administrative procedures the project would not have got off the ground. My job as head of the private office was to get things moving quickly. Although we did not follow the classic procedure, the project was nevertheless subjected to Treasury scrutiny.",

Whatever the amount committed, the Treasury inspectorate had the power to supervise and give an opinion. Even though the contract was limited from the financial point of view, everything was above board.",
                "You stated in substance (p. 9540) that you were irked by the inflexibility and resistance to change of the Treasury inspectorate and that in your private office you were advised to do things differently, namely to split the contract into three parts so that the fees would be lower than the BEF 1,250,000 threshold triggering compulsory scrutiny by the Treasury inspectors, and you went on to say that despite doing things that way you had once again submitted the subdivided project to the Treasury inspector, who the second time had given a favourable opinion, and that splitting the project into three had led to a significant reduction in cost amounting to 25% of the overall fees. Do you stand by that assessment of your conduct?",
                "Yes, because the Treasury inspection procedure took some time. We wanted to work quickly and we came back to another way of doing things, which nevertheless received the Treasury inspectorate's approval, but more quickly, even though supervision was maintained. I did not have much time and I had to find a solution by using a faster procedure, namely approval of the order to pay. I knew that I had to give an account of my actions to the Minister and I insisted that the Treasury inspector sign each file, as was done even where this was not mandatory.",

Any judicial authority had to be subject to procedures intended to guarantee the integrity of its decisions to the persons within its jurisdiction and to safeguard the right to due process, a principle which the House of Representatives had fully understood in 1865. The fact that there was no statute governing procedure had in the present case led the Court of Cassation to establish an ad hoc procedure, making up for Parliament's failure to legislate. By laying down the applicable procedural rules itself, even by analogy, the Court of Cassation had manifestly disregarded the principle of the separation of powers as regards enactment and application of the criminal law. Even though, by a process of elimination, the procedure followed by the Court of Cassation could not be anything other than the procedure laid down for the criminal courts, this was not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an accessible and foreseeable procedure.",

The procedure to be followed was the procedure which existed for the ordinary criminal courts, and this was perfectly foreseeable in the light of the teachings of case-law and legal theory, and also on account of the fact that the other three types of procedure – those laid down for the assize courts, juvenile courts and military courts – were obviously not applicable. The Court of Cassation had therefore not acted as an ad hoc legislature, nor had it gone beyond the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of existing law by applying the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts, while introducing a number of modifications made necessary by the constitutional requirement that it had to sit as a full court."

Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, § 33). According to the case-law, the object of the term “established by law” in Article 6 of the Convention is to ensure “that the judicial organisation in a democratic society [does] not depend on the discretion of the Executive, but that it [is] regulated by law emanating from Parliament” (see Zand v. Austria, application no. 7360/76, Commission's report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 15, pp. 70 and 80).

It must also satisfy a series of other conditions, including the independence of its members and the length of their terms of office, impartiality and the existence of procedural safeguards. There is no doubt that the Court of Cassation, which in Belgian law was the only court which had jurisdiction to try Mr Coëme, was a “tribunal established by law” (see, mutatis mutandis, Prosa and Others v.

The Court notes that no legislation implementing Article 103 of the Constitution was in force when the applicants stood trial in the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 75, 80 and 81 above). Yet Article 103 § 2 required Parliament to lay down the procedure before the Court of Cassation, and Article 139 of the Constitution of 7 February 1831 insisted on the need to do so as soon as possible. However, assisted by his counsel and his lawyers, Mr Coëme was not in total ignorance of the procedural rules which would be applied during the trial. He could not have been unaware that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would probably be followed, as this could have been inferred from legal theory and case-law, although this was limited to the Court of Cassation's judgment of 12 July 1865 (see paragraph 79 above). He could also have deduced this from Article 7 of the Law of 19 June 1865, even though that law had been enacted only to deal with a specific set of circumstances. The Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation apparently reached that conclusion himself and advised the representatives of some of the applicants accordingly at the interview on 3 November 1995. When the trial opened on 5 February 1996 (see paragraph 41 above) the President of the Court of Cassation himself confirmed that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would be followed, announcing that the case would be tried in accordance with the provisions of Article 190 of the Code of Criminal Investigation."

In its interlocutory judgment of 12 February 1996 (see paragraph 46 above) the Court of Cassation announced that the rules governing the procedure in the ordinary criminal courts would be applied only in so far as they were compatible “with the provisions governing the procedure in the Court of Cassation sitting as a full court”. As a result, the parties could not ascertain in advance all the details of the procedure which would be followed. They could not foresee in what way the Court of Cassation would amend or modify the provisions governing the normal conduct of a criminal trial, as established by the Belgian parliament.",

It imposes certain specific requirements regarding the conduct of proceedings, with a view to guaranteeing a fair trial, which entails respect for equality of arms. The principle of equality of arms requires that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, among other authorities, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 238, § 53).

The Court of Cassation's decision on an alleged connection, which was not sufficiently reasoned, had constituted treatment derogating from ordinary law and had infringed their defence rights by depriving them, without any reasonable justification, of a series of important safeguards which would have been available to any other defendant and from which Mr Coëme, who had been tried at the same time as them, had benefited in part when his case was investigated by the House of Representatives."

Mr Coëme and Mr Javeau were standing trial as co-principals or accomplices implicated in certain offences and the other applicants for various offences committed in connection with the activities of the “I” association. Even though the judicial authorities were not obliged to join the cases, joinder in the present case was either fully justified to avoid the risk of contradictory decisions or desirable for reasons of coherence, to save having more than one trial and in short to ensure the proper administration of justice. It was a perfectly reasonable and rational decision which provided the best means of assessing and focusing on the criminal conduct of the various accused, and the applicants could not complain that the Court of Cassation's jurisdiction to try them had not been laid down by law or that it was not foreseeable."

The Court reiterates that organisation of the judicial system and jurisdiction in criminal cases cannot be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, and notes that it was Article 103 of the Constitution which, until the 1998 reform (see paragraphs 68 and 69 above), required government ministers, exceptionally, to be tried by the Court of Cassation. However, there was no provision extending the Court of Cassation's jurisdiction to defendants other than ministers for offences connected with those for which ministers were standing trial (see, for the same reasoning applied to the contrary case, Crociani and Others v. Italy, joined applications nos. 8603/79, 8722/79, 8723/99 and 8729/79, Commission decision of 18 December 1980, DR 22, pp. 147 and 219). The need for such a provision appears all the more clearly because the issue now seems to have been settled by Article 29 § 1 of the Special Law of 25 June 1998 on the criminal responsibility of ministers, which provides: “Co-principals and accomplices implicated in an offence for which a minister is prosecuted and the perpetrators of connected offences must be prosecuted and tried at the same time as the minister” (see paragraph 69 above).",

In the present case these indications cannot justify the conclusion that the rule on connection was “established by law”, especially since the Court of Cassation, the supreme Belgian judicial authority, itself decided, not having referred the question to the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court, that summoning persons who had never held ministerial office to stand trial before it was the result of applying Article 103 of the Constitution rather than the provisions of the Code of Criminal Investigation or the Judicial Code (see paragraph 47 above)."

The applicants' complaints concerned the way Article 26 § 2 of the Special Law on the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court should be interpreted. In raising that issue, they were asking the Court to re-examine a point that was a matter for domestic law only, and was therefore not within its jurisdiction. Even though it had been challenged, the Court of Cassation's decision not to refer the preliminary questions proposed was reasonable and not in any way arbitrary, so that it could not be in breach of Article 6 of the Convention.

It further refers to its case-law to the effect that the “right to a court”, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard (see, among other authorities, the Brualla Gómez de la Torre v. Spain judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2955, § 33). The right to have a preliminary question referred to a court cannot be absolute either, even where a particular field of law may be interpreted only by a court designated by statute and where the legislation concerned requires other courts to refer to that court, without reservation, all questions relating to that field. As the Government submitted, it is in accordance with the functioning of such a mechanism for the court to verify whether it is empowered or required to refer a preliminary question, first satisfying itself that the question must be answered before it can determine the case before it.

                "118. Mr Mazy and Mr Stalport submitted that the Court of Cassation could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and referred in particular to the role habitually played by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and his role in the handling of the present case. They observed, firstly, that on 3 November 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had held a meeting at which he informed the participants that the proceedings would be conducted according to the ordinary rules of the Code of Criminal Investigation; this was confirmed at the first hearing held by the Court of Cassation. That meant that he had previously been at least informed of the Court of Cassation's decision as to the procedure to be followed. Secondly, referring to the role traditionally played by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, which the Court had had occasion to assess when dealing with the Delcourt, Borgers, Vermeulen and Van Orshoven cases (see the judgments in the cases of Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11; Borgers v. Belgium, 30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B; Vermeulen v. Belgium, 20 February 1996, Reports 1996-I; and Van Orshoven v. Belgium, 25 June 1997, Reports 1997-III), and particularly the traditional practice whereby the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office participated in drafting the court's judgments, they observed that the confusion between the respective roles of the Court of Cassation and the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office there was particularly striking. The Government would find it hard to prove that any measures whatsoever had been taken to establish the necessary distance between the Court of Cassation and the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office there – the prosecution in the present case. They noted on the contrary that during the trial the representatives of the Principal Public Prosecutor had taken their places in the raised part of the courtroom on the same level as the judges and used to enter and leave the hearing room in the company of the judges of the Court of Cassation. They likewise considered it symptomatic that the names of the persons composing the Court of Cassation and the representatives of its Principal Public Prosecutor were listed in the same paragraph in the hearing records (see paragraph 52 above) and that the Court's judgment reproduced the prosecution pleadings practically word for word."

                "119. With regard to the independence and impartiality of the Court of Cassation, the Government submitted that the applicants had not adduced any evidence of concrete facts or events supporting their argument, in which they had referred to a “traditional practice” of participation by the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office in the drafting of the Court of Cassation's judgments. That practice had ceased on the very day of the Borgers judgment (in criminal cases) and the Vermeulen judgment (in civil cases). The Government noted, firstly, that the Court of Cassation had not yet been constituted on 3 November 1995; the nineteen judges (fifteen ordinary members and four substitutes) had not been appointed until a few weeks before the first hearing on 5 February 1996. It had therefore been materially impossible for the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office to be informed of the procedure chosen by a court not yet constituted. It was, however, obvious that the procedure mentioned by the Principal Public Prosecutor was the only one possible and foreseeable. The Government also observed that the two members of the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office had not sat on the same bench as the Court of Cassation itself but had a separate seat facing the seat of the two registrars and closer to the bar of the court than to the judges' bench. Moreover, throughout the trial and the judges' deliberations, these two officers of the court had avoided all contact with the court when not in hearings. Lastly, the Court of Cassation had on several occasions given a clear sign of its independence vis-à-vis the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office. In particular, on 12 February 1996, according to Mr Javeau and Mr Stalport themselves, it had asked the Principal Advocate-General to confine his remarks to the facts of the case and not make submissions for the prosecution (see paragraph 50 above) and it had not accepted the prosecution's suggestion that the defence case should be heard before the prosecution's (see paragraph 51 above). The similarities between the judgment and the prosecution's submissions did not justify a legitimate doubt about the Court of Cassation's impartiality."

Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1571, § 65).

As for impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial: the first consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Gautrin and Others v. France judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1030-31, § 58). Only the second test is relevant in the instant case. In this respect, however, even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused (see, among other authorities, the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 48, and the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 794, § 38). In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a court lacks independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt judgment cited above, p. 21, § 48, and the Gautrin and Others judgment cited above, pp. 1030-31, § 58)."

On that point, the Court is not aware of any circumstance capable of justifying the concerns caused, in the applicants' submission, by the fact that at the meeting on 3 November 1996 the Principal Public Prosecutor indicated what procedure would be followed. It would appear in fact that this information was supplied at a time when the judges who would try the case had not yet been designated and had not yet had the opportunity to consider the question which arose in that respect on account of Parliament's failure to legislate. Moreover, there is no justification for the concerns about the existence of certain relations of subjection or dependency between the Court of Cassation and its Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, caused, in the applicants' submission, by the other facts they mentioned. In the Court's opinion, the two circumstances referred to by the Government in support of their argument that the Court of Cassation was independent of the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, and in particular the assertion made by Mr Javeau and Mr Stalport about the President's intervention when the Principal Advocate-General was presenting the facts of the case, remove all legitimate foundation from the doubts the applicants may have felt in this respect."

He submitted that he had not been heard on the subject of the offences he was charged with except when he was interviewed on 16 March 1994 in the context of the investigation being conducted in the proceedings against Minister M. Having been questioned as a witness, he was not informed that he had the right not to reply to the questions he was asked. He had never been heard as a defendant after the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had brought proceedings against him. Lastly, the Court of Cassation had expressly taken some of the statements he had made on 16 March 1994 to constitute a confession, ruling in particular, when dealing with the offence he had been charged with: “It is apparent from the statements of Jean-Louis Stalport ... that the purpose of severing the original contract was to evade the mandatory scrutiny of the Treasury inspector.” He observed that in the John Murray case (John Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, p. 49, § 45), the Court had held: “The right to remain silent under police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6”."

Mr Stalport, whose conviction had not been based on his statements alone, had therefore not been prevented from exercising his right to remain silent, to defend himself effectively or to request additional investigative measures, which Mr Javeau had successfully done in the Court of Cassation. In the Government's opinion, the true purpose of the principle prohibiting self-incrimination was to prevent a participant in the judicial process being obliged to tell the truth under oath and on pain of a penalty if he lied, only to have his own declarations used against him later and to be accused of an offence."

It appears from the statements referred to by the Court of Cassation that it must have based this inference on Mr Javeau's remarks, as reported in the record of his interview on 8 June 1993 (see paragraph 21 above) not on a confession allegedly to be found in the record of the interview with Mr Stalport on 16 March 1994 (see paragraph 27 above). Mr Stalport had always asserted, both at that interview and when he was questioned on 20 February 1996 (see paragraph 52 above), that the purpose of the decision to sever the initial contract had not been to evade the scrutiny of the Treasury inspector.

Yet the Court of Cassation, sitting as the court of first and last instance, had not given judgment until six and a half years later. The applicant pointed out that the offences he stood accused of, which were known to the investigating judge from the outset, were so simple and lacking in complexity that the judgment of 5 April 1996 devoted only half a page to them. In addition, few of the documents in the investigation file concerned him. This applied in particular to the court expert's report, most of which related to facts which were not included in the charges against him. The alleged complexity of the prosecution was merely the result of the authorities' determination to establish the existence of a “system” in which all the defendants were involved. Application of the connection rule was justified by the requirements of the administration of justice only where the rights of the defence were respected. Yet he could have been tried separately on the charges against him as early as 1994, if not before, and this would not have prevented the prosecution from arguing that the offences he stood accused of formed part of a system."

The applicant's complaints were essentially directed against application of the connection rule, which had been reasonable in view of Mr Hermanus's close involvement in the criminal system that had been set up.

It reiterates that in criminal matters the “reasonable time” referred to in Article 6 § 1 begins to run as soon as a person is “charged”: this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he was to be prosecuted or the date when the preliminary investigations were opened. The term “charge”, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, may be defined as “the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence”, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether the situation of the suspect has been “substantially affected” (see the Hozee v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1100, § 43, and the Eckle v.

In addition, the case raised thorny legal questions which, before being posed to the applicants and then to the Court of Cassation, had to be answered by the Belgian judicial authorities.

But in its judgment of 5 April 1996 the Court of Cassation had ruled that time had begun to run again and extended a limitation period which had already lapsed, this being illegal given that an initial five-year period had begun to run on 30 November 1989 in Mr Coëme's case and on 29 February 1988 in Mr Hermanus's case. In addition, it had restarted the limitation period a second time, although this was not permissible under Article 22 of the Code of Criminal Investigation, taking into consideration the date of 10 June 1992.

Following the applicants' interpretation would create a serious obstacle making it difficult for States to introduce the necessary changes to criminal procedures and to take account of the courts' excessive caseloads. In the alternative, the Government submitted that, even if Article 7 had to be considered to apply also to limitation of criminal proceedings, its only scope would be to prevent limitation becoming an issue again once prosecution had become time-barred. It was only in such a case that there would be retrospectiveness, in that the new law would have to “go back in time” from the date of its entry into force in order to be able to annul a time-bar. But nothing like that had taken place in the present case. On 31 December 1993, when the new law had come into force, the proceedings had not yet become time-barred according to the rules formerly applicable and the Court of Cassation had applied from the time of the offences in issue the new limitation period laid down by the Law of 24 December 1993.

The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 7 embodies, inter alia, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts' interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see the Cantoni v. France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1627, § 29; and the S.W. and C.R. v. the United Kingdom judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A nos. 335-B and 335-C, pp. 41-42, § 35, and pp. 68-69, § 33, respectively). The Court must therefore verify that at the time when an accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted and convicted there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable, and that the punishment imposed did not exceed the limits fixed by that provision (see Murphy v. the United Kingdom, application no. 4681/70, Commission decision of 3 and 4 October 1972, Collection 43, p. 1). Since the term “penalty” is autonomous in scope, to render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see the Welch v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 307-A, p. 13, § 27). While the text of the Convention is the starting-point for such an assessment, the Court may have cause to base its findings on other sources, such as the travaux préparatoires. Having regard to the aim of the Convention, which is to protect rights that are practical and effective, it may also take into consideration the need to preserve a balance between the general interest and the fundamental rights of individuals and the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see, among other authorities, the Airey v.

In Belgian law the classification of an offence is determined not according to the penalty applicable but according to the penalty actually applied. The date of the judgment must therefore be the standpoint for determining what period must elapse before prosecution becomes time-barred. That being so, the Court of Cassation had regard to the limitation period for less serious indictable offences. Subsequently, applying the provisions of the Law of 24 December 1993 immediately, and after noting that the offences found to have been made out were not time-barred on the date of its entry into force, it held that the correct limitation period was five years from the time of the offences, which period could be extended, where the case arose, by a new five-year period counting from a measure causing time to begin to run again lawfully taken before expiry of the first five-year period (see paragraph 57 above)."

Given his position as a commanding military officer, the Court is of the view that he could have been reasonably expected to take such special care in assessing the risks that the operation in Mazie Bati entailed. The Court considers that, having regard to the flagrantly unlawful nature of the ill-treatment and killing of the nine villagers in the established circumstances of the operation on 27 May 1944 ( see paragraphs 15-20 above), even the most cursory reflection by the applicant would have indicated that, at the very least, the impugned acts risked being counter to the laws and customs of war as understood at that time and, notably, risked constituting war crimes for which, as commander, he could be held individually and criminally accountable."

That being so, the Court of Appeal rightly found that the acts of individual members of his group ... could not be seen as [mere] excesses on the part of those concerned.",

These included the inhumane treatment of prisoners, the employment of poisoned weapons, the improper use of flags of truce, and similar matters. Many of these prohibitions had been enforced long before the date of the Convention; but since 1907 they have certainly been crimes, punishable as offences against the laws of war; yet the Hague Convention [(IV)] nowhere designates such practices as criminal, nor is any sentence prescribed, nor any mention made of a court to try and punish offenders. For many years past, however, military tribunals have tried and punished individuals guilty of violating the rules of land warfare laid down by this Convention. ... In interpreting the words of the [Kellogg-Briand Pact], it must be remembered that international law is not the product of an international legislature, and that such international agreements as the [Kellogg-Briand Pact] have to deal with general principles of law, and not with administrative matters of procedure. The law of war is to be found not only in treaties, but in the customs and practices of States which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principles of justice applied by jurists and practised by military courts. This law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world. Indeed, in many cases treaties do no more than express and define for more accurate reference the principles of law already existing.”",

The effect of this clause, is, in strict law, to deprive some of the conventions of their binding force as direct treaty obligations, either from the very beginning of a war or in the course of it as soon as a non-signatory Power, however insignificant, joins the ranks of the Belligerents. Although the obligation to observe the provisions of the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] as a binding treaty may be swept away by operation of the ‘ general participation clause ’, or otherwise, the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] remains as good evidence of the customary law of nations, to be considered by the Tribunal along with all other available evidence in determining the customary law to be applied in any given situation. ...”"

Such development of the criminal law was all the more important when a democratic State governed by the rule of law succeeded a totalitarian regime and pursued obligations to bring criminal proceedings against members of the former regime."

However, the respondent Government considered that the Chamber had exceeded its subsidiary role in altering the factual determinations of the domestic courts found to have acted compatibly with Article 6. Indeed, in reassessing the facts, the Chamber had overlooked certain crucial facts surrounding the events of 27 May 1944 which had been established by the Criminal Affairs Division and upheld by the Supreme Court Senate, notably in relation to the existence of a judgment of a Partisan tribunal as regards the villagers of Mazie Bati. In any event, any such Partisan tribunal judgment would have been unlawful as it would have been delivered in absentia in violation of even the basic tenets of a fair trial. The respondent Government had submitted to the Chamber letters dated February 2008 from the Prosecutor General ’ s Office (about the existence of the Partisan tribunal, the role of Mazie Bati and its villagers in the German defence and why arms had been issued to the villagers) and resubmitted these to the Grand Chamber."

During that Soviet occupation, Latvia was prevented from exercising its sovereign powers, including its international obligations. Apart from the resultant fear of the local population of the Red Partisans, it was a distortion for the applicant to suggest that the events of 27 May 1944 in Mazie Bati were a civil war incident as opposed to part of the international armed conflict opposing the Axis powers and, inter alia, the USSR."

In any event, even if they had lost that status and were to be considered “combatants”, nothing allowed the summary execution and murder of any person hors de combat unless a fair trial had taken place (and there was no proof of this) wherein it was established that they were indeed implicated in a criminal offence. Moreover, these were not lawful acts of “lawful belligerent reprisals” since, inter alia, such actions had been prohibited against prisoners of war since the 1929 Geneva Convention and, as regards civilians, it was never suggested that the villagers committed war crimes themselves."

His conviction was also objectively foreseeable given, inter alia, the declarations of certain States during the Second World War and the international and national prosecutions during and immediately after that war, in which processes the Soviet authorities had much involvement. That he was a Soviet war hero for years thereafter was not relevant: the key point was whether the acts could have been reasonably foreseen in 1944 as amounting to war crimes and not that his later fortuitous political situation would have excluded his prosecution.

Indeed, the Court had already recognised that all three Baltic States had lost their independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ( the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 and its secret Protocol, the Treaty on Borders and Friendly Relations of 1939 and its secret Protocol, as well as the third Nazi-Soviet secret Protocol of 10 January 1941): the Pact was an undisputed historical fact, an illegal agreement to commit aggression against, inter alia, the Baltic States and resulted in their illegal occupation by Soviet forces. Indeed, the Soviet invasion of the Baltic States in June 1940 was an act of aggression within the meaning of the London Convention on the Definition of Aggression of 1933 and the Convention between Lithuania and the USSR on the Definition of Aggression of 1933. The involuntary consent of the Baltic States faced with Soviet aggression did not render this act of aggression lawful.",

Two conclusions followed: the USSR had not obtained any sovereign rights to the Baltic States so that under international law the Baltic States were never a legitimate part of the USSR and, additionally, the Baltic States continued to exist as international legal persons after the 1940 aggression by the USSR which aggression resulted in the illegal occupation of the Baltic States.",

The Baltic peoples had no particular reason to feel sympathy with either and, indeed, had rational fears against both aggressors (in this respect, the Lithuanian Government take issue with paragraph 130 of the Chamber judgment given the well-established historical fact of USSR crimes in the Baltic States) so that a degree of collaboration with one aggressor in self-defence should not be treated differently.

It was a core principle of international humanitarian law in 1944 that there was a fundamental distinction between armed forces (belligerents) and the peaceful populations (civilians) and that the latter enjoyed immunity from military attack ( in that respect, they cited the Martens Clause; see paragraphs 86 to 87 above). The villagers did not meet the criteria defining “ combatants ” and were not therefore a lawful military target. Even if there had been some degree of collaboration by the villagers with the German forces, they had to retain civilian protection unless they met the “ combatant ” criteria: the opposite view would leave a population at the mercy of belligerent commanders who could arbitrarily decide that they were combatants and thus a legitimate military target. The killing of the women, unless they were taking part in hostilities as combatants, was not in any circumstances justified, as it would always have been contrary to the most elementary considerations and laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience.

The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written and unwritten law and which implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability. As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; K. ‑ H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Jorgic v.

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws ( see X. v. Belgium, no. 268/57, Commission decision of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, p. 241). In any event, the Court further notes that the definition of war crimes included in Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was found to be declaratory of international laws and customs of war as understood in 1939 ( see paragraphs 118 above and 207 below)."

When the applicant ’ s unit entered Mazie Bati, the villagers were not engaging in hostilities: they were preparing to celebrate Pentecost and all the deceased villagers were found by the Partisans at home (one in his bath and another in bed). While arms and munitions supplied by the German military administration were found in the deceased villagers ’ homes, none of those villagers were carrying those or any arms. The Chamber ( at paragraph 127 of its judgment ) found this latter fact to be of no relevance but, for the reasons set out below, the Grand Chamber considers this pertinent. While the applicant maintained before the Grand Chamber that no one was burned alive, the domestic courts established that four persons died in the burning farm buildings, three of whom were women.

The domestic courts found the villagers to be “civilians”, an analysis supported by the Latvian Government.

This could mean that the applicant lost “ combatant ” status [22] (thereby losing the right to attack [23] ) and wearing the enemy uniform during combat could of itself have amounted to an offence [24]. However, the domestic courts did not charge the applicant with a separate war crime on this basis. This factor does have some bearing, nonetheless, on other related war crimes of which he was accused (notably, treacherous killing and wounding, see paragraph 217 below). The Court has therefore proceeded on the basis that the applicant and his unit were “combatants”. One of the hypotheses as regards the deceased villagers is that they could also be considered “combatants” ( see paragraph 194 above)."

Earlier treaty provisions and declarations would indicate that by 1944 “civilians” were defined a contrario to the definition of “ combatants ” [29].

                "207. While the notion of war crimes can be traced back centuries, the mid-nineteenth century saw a period of solid codification of the acts constituting a war crime and for which an individual could be held criminally liable. The Lieber Code 1863 ( see paragraphs 63-77 above) outlined a multitude of offences against the laws and customs of war and prescribed punishments, and individual criminal responsibility was inherent in numerous of its Articles [33]. While it was an American Code, it was the first modern codification of the laws and customs of war and was influential in later codification conferences, notably in Brussels in 1874 ( see paragraph 79 above). The Oxford Manual 1880 forbade a multitude of acts as contrary to the laws and customs of war and explicitly provided for “offenders to be liable to punishment specified in the penal law”. These earlier codifications, and in particular the Draft Brussels Declaration 1874, in turn inspired the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. These latter instruments were the most influential of the earlier codifications and were, in 1907, declaratory of the laws and customs of war: they defined, inter alia, relevant key notions (combatants, levée en masse, hors de combat ), they listed detailed offences against the laws and customs of war and they provided a residual protection, through the Martens Clause, to inhabitants and belligerents for cases not covered by the specific provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. Responsibility therein was on States, which had to issue consistent instructions to their armed forces and pay compensation if their armed forces violated those rules.",
                "The impact on the civilian population of the First World War prompted provisions in the Treaties of Versailles and Sèvres on the responsibility, trial and punishment of alleged war criminals. The work of the International Commission in 1919 (after the First World War) and of the United Nations War Crimes Commission ( UNWCC ) (during the Second World War) made significant contributions to the principle of individual criminal liability in international law. “Geneva law” (notably the Conventions of 1864, 1906 and 1929; see paragraphs 53 to 62 above) protected the victims of war and provided safeguards for disabled armed forces personnel and persons not taking part in hostilities. Both the “Hague” and the “Geneva” branches of law were closely interrelated, the latter supplementing the former.",
                "The Charter of the IMT Nuremberg provided a non-exhaustive definition of war crimes for which individual criminal responsibility was retained and the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg opined that the humanitarian rules in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations were “recognised by all civilised nations and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war” by 1939 and that violations of those provisions constituted crimes for which individuals were punishable. There was agreement in contemporary doctrine that international law had already defined war crimes and required individuals to be prosecuted [34]. In consequence, the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was not ex post facto criminal legislation. The later Nuremberg Principles, drawn from the Charter and judgment of the IMT Nuremberg, reiterated the definition of war crimes set out in the Charter and that anyone committing a crime under international law was responsible and liable to punishment [35]."

International prosecution through the IMTs was the exception, the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg explicitly recognising the continuing role of the domestic courts. Accordingly, the international liability of the State based on treaties and conventions [36] did not preclude the customary responsibility of States to prosecute and punish individuals, via their criminal courts or military tribunals, for violations of the laws and customs of war. International and national law (the latter including transposition of international norms) served as a basis for domestic prosecutions and liability. In particular, where national law did not provide for the specific characteristics of a war crime, the domestic court could rely on international law as a basis for its reasoning, without infringing the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena sine lege [37]."

Lastly, during the Second World War there was a signalled intent from the outset to ensure the prosecution of war criminals [40] and, parallel to international prosecutions, the principle of domestic prosecutions of war criminals was maintained [41]. Accordingly, as well as the important IMT prosecutions, domestic trials took place during the Second World War (notably in the USSR) [42] and immediately after the Second World War [43], all concerning alleged war crimes committed during that war, certain trials being notable for their comprehensive treatment of relevant principles of the laws and customs of war, particularly as regards the necessity of a fair trial of combatants and civilians suspected of war crimes."

The Grand Chamber considers (as did the Chamber, at paragraph 112 of its judgment) that it is not its role to pronounce on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR and, in any event in the present case, it is not necessary to do so. While in 1944 a nexus with an international armed conflict was required to prosecute acts as war crimes, that did not mean that only armed forces personnel or nationals of a belligerent State could be so accused. The relevant nexus was a direct connection between the alleged crime and the international armed conflict so that the alleged crime had to be an act in furtherance of war objectives [44]. The domestic courts found that the operation on 27 May 1944 was mounted given the suspicion that certain villagers had cooperated with the German military administration so that it is evident that the impugned events had a direct connection to the USSR/German international armed conflict and were ostensibly carried out in furtherance of the Soviet war objectives."

In its later Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion [53], the ICJ referred to the two “ cardinal principles contained in the texts constituting the fabric of humanitarian law”. The first, referred to above, was the principle of distinction which aimed at the “protection of the civilian population and objects” and the second was the “obligation to avoid unnecessary suffering to combatants” [54]. Relying expressly on the Martens Clause, the ICJ noted that the Hague and Geneva Conventions had become “intransgressible principles of international customary law” as early as the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg. This was because, according to the ICJ, a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict were fundamental to “the respect of the human person” and to “elementary considerations of humanity”. Those principles, including the Martens Clause, constituted legal norms against which conduct in the context of war was to be measured by courts [55]."

It considers, having regard notably to Article 23 (c) of the Hague Regulations, that, even if the deceased villagers were considered combatants or civilians who had participated in hostilities, jus in bello in 1944 considered the circumstances of their murder and ill-treatment a war crime since those acts violated a fundamental rule of the laws and customs of war protecting an enemy rendered hors de combat. For this protection to apply, a person had to be wounded, disabled or unable for another reason to defend him/herself (including not carrying arms), a person was not required to have a particular legal status, and a formal surrender was not required [56]. As combatants, the villagers would also have been entitled to protection as prisoners of war under the control of the applicant and his unit and their subsequent ill-treatment and summary execution would have been contrary to the numerous rules and customs of war protecting prisoners of war (noted at paragraph 202 above).

Secondly, the Court finds that the domestic courts reasonably relied on Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations to found a separate conviction as regards treacherous wounding and killing. The concepts of treachery and perfidy were closely linked at the relevant time so that the wounding or killing was considered treacherous if it was carried out while unlawfully inducing the enemy to believe they were not under threat of attack by, for example, making improper use of an enemy uniform. As noted at paragraphs 16 and 201 above, the applicant and his unit were indeed wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms during the operation in Mazie Bati. Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations clearly applies if the villagers are considered “combatants” and could also apply if they were considered “ civilians who had participated in hostilities ”. In this latter respect, the text of Article 23 (b) referred to killing or wounding treacherously “ individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army ”, which could have been interpreted as including any persons under some form of control of a hostile army including the civilian population of an occupied territory."

It was further developed through “Geneva law ” on prisoners of war (women were considered especially vulnerable in this situation) [57]. The Court considers these expressions of “special protection”, understood in conjunction with the protection of the Martens Clause ( see paragraphs 86-87 and 215 above), sufficient to find that there was a plausible legal basis for convicting the applicant of a separate war crime as regards the burning to death of Mrs Krupniks.

As the respondent Government remarked, in the applicant ’ s version of events to the Chamber ( see paragraphs 21-24 above) and repeated to the Grand Chamber ( see paragraph 162 above), the applicant in fact describes what he ought to have done (arrested the villagers for trial). In any event, whether or not any Partisan trial had taken place ( see paragraph 132 of the Chamber judgment), a trial with the accused villagers in absentia, without their knowledge or participation, followed by their execution, would not qualify as a fair one."

That court noted that that was sufficient to result in the command responsibility of the applicant for the acts of the unit, relying on Article 6 of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg. In particular, those established facts indicated that he was de jure and de facto in control of the unit. Given the purpose of the mission established domestically, he had the required mens rea. Indeed, the applicant ’ s own submission to the Grand Chamber ( that his unit could not have arrested the villagers given, inter alia, the unit ’ s combat duties and the situation; see paragraph 162 above) is entirely consistent with the above ‑ mentioned facts established by the Criminal Affairs Division.

The Court sees no basis to question the domestic courts ’ rejection of this defence (whether the villagers were considered “ combatants ” or “ civilians who had participated in hostilities ” ) [59]."

The parties essentially disputed therefore whether the applicant ’ s prosecution (on the basis that there was no limitation period for the relevant offences) amounted to an ex post facto extension of a national limitation period which would have applied in 1944 and whether, consequently, that prosecution amounted to a retrospective application of the criminal law ( see Coëme and Others v.

Equally, section 14 of the 1926 Criminal Code, with its limitation periods applicable to crimes foreseen by that Code only, could have had no application to war crimes sourced under international law and there was no provision in that Code saying that its prescription provisions could have had any such application. On the contrary, the Court notes that the 1926 Criminal Code was conceived of as a system to pursue “dangerous social acts” which could harm the established socialist order [60], the terminology in the Official Notes to section 14 illustrating this. In such circumstances, a domestic prosecution for war crimes in 1944 would have required reference to international law, not only as regards the definition of such crimes, but also as regards the determination of any applicable limitation period."

Germany, cited above, §§ 92-105 ).

Given his position as a commanding military officer, the Court is of the view that he could have been reasonably expected to take such special care in assessing the risks that the operation in Mazie Bati entailed. The Court considers that, having regard to the flagrantly unlawful nature of the ill-treatment and killing of the nine villagers in the established circumstances of the operation on 27 May 1944 ( see paragraphs 15-20 above), even the most cursory reflection by the applicant would have indicated that, at the very least, the impugned acts risked being counter to the laws and customs of war as understood at that time and, notably, risked constituting war crimes for which, as commander, he could be held individually and criminally accountable."

As regards the offence with which he was charged, he stated that he had invested all the money he had taken from the public. There had been no intention to lie or abuse trust on his part. This assertion was supported by the large number of assets that his company owned and managed. Lastly, the applicant alleged that the decrease in the value of his property had resulted from the mismanagement of the administrators and improper handling of the sale of his company ’ s assets."

Relying on the same facts as established in the lower courts ’ decisions, the Supreme Court held that the applicant ’ s actions and the company ’ s activities had been improper and unlawful. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“On the basis of the wealth of material, documents and experts ’ reports which have been adduced before the trial and appeal courts, it is clear that the accused collected considerable amounts of money and foreign currency from members of the public by means of false promises to repay the amounts and pay high interest rates, knowing that he was incapable of keeping his promises. In contrast to the accused ’ s claims, the [lower] courts established that the taking of money from members of the public, in the form of so-called loans, was carried out for the sole purpose of acquiring property for the accused himself and other persons. The accused was not capable of securing the amounts in question relying solely on the money taken from members of the public and he knew that he could not obtain profits in a lawful manner in order to repay the loans.",
                "The undertaking to pay back the money collected from members of the public was not based on the company ’ s realisable profits, but on the prospect of attracting money in the same way from other members of the public. The [lower] courts established that no lawful and normal commercial company could secure the interest rates needed to cover the high rate of interest that the accused offered to persons from whom he had collected extraordinarily large sums of money.",
                "In augmenting untruthfully the value of investments he had made using the money taken from members of the public, the accused ’ s purpose was to attract a large number of persons in response to the competition from the so-called foundations and other pyramid schemes which were operating at the time, and to instil in the public the false idea that he possessed property and other assets which would underwrite the obligations he had entered into. The increase in interest rates for creditors and the shortening of deadlines for the repayment of loans fell into this same category.",
                "Regard being had to the whole body of evidence which was analysed in detail by the District Court and by the Court of Appeal, it emerges that, using money taken from members of the public, the accused created a pyramid scheme the base of which consisted of loans collected from members of the public who had been deceived, while its apex consisted of repayments which, as established by the courts, were not sufficient to fulfil the accused ’ s [contractual] obligations.",
                "It appears from the investigation and the case file that the criminal intent to commit theft by way of deception had its genesis in 1994, through the process of loan-taking. With the passage of time this intent evolved as the applicant expanded his activities, which took on staggering proportions as the scheme was rolled out across the country until 23 January 1997, the date that marked the end of his pyramid scheme.",
                "At its inception, the document used by the company for the taking of loans consisted of a simple letter or an order ( mandat ). The interest rates were between 5% and 6% per month. This corresponded to the period between the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995.",
                "With the passage of time the documents were modified and took on more stereotypical form, containing the first name and surname of the lender, referred to as the creditor, and the name of the borrower, i.e. the accused. These documents, which were the same as those used in other pyramid schemes – the so-called foundations – were unilaterally and systematically used to lie to, deceive and abuse the trust of thousands and thousands of poor people who dreamed of earning money from the accused.",
                "In 1996 the accused concocted a refinement to the scheme, based on deception and lies, when he issued the so-called savings books ( librezë kursimi ), which were never put into use.",
                "In order to increase the trust of creditors and also make it easier to steal from and deceive them, the accused raised the interest rates to 8%, while applying higher interest rates to his closest circle [of acquaintances], who spread the word about the miracles performed by his company.",
                "It is obvious that Vefa, even though it expanded across the country and was made up of many subsidiaries, existed as a single financial and economic unit. Even the company ’ s balance sheets were submitted as a single balance sheet covering the whole company. More specifically, according to the 1993 balance sheet, the company had a net profit amounting to ALL 63,000 and a workforce of six people. According to the 1994 balance sheet, the company ’ s net profit was ALL 305,928, which was equal to 0.04% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors.",
                "In 1995 there was an increase in the number of loans [made by members of the public]. Consequently, Vefa ’ s balance sheet reflected increased values. The company ’ s net profit for that year reached ALL 73,150,201, the equivalent of 0.02% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors.",
                "By 1996 the process of loan-taking had assumed unprecedented proportions and, consequently, the company ’ s net profit totalled USD 2,125,882, the equivalent of 0.004% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors."

However, it concluded that the total amount of the applicant ’ s liabilities was ALL 22,374,141,130 (approximately USD 157,453,000 at the material time) after having deducted the company ’ s cash flows, which totalled ALL 6,875,481,331. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“ ... Any eventual change in the number of creditors does not affect the accused ’ s guilt or his sentence in respect of the offence he has committed. A final court decision in the criminal case is binding on the court examining civil liabilities only in so far as the commission of the criminal offence is concerned and if the offence was committed by the accused. It does not have any consequences for the resolution of civil proceedings that may be instituted in the future.",
                "During the investigation stage, as well as in the trial and appeal proceedings, the accused claimed that, since his actions vis-à-vis his creditors constituted civil relations in the form of fulfilment of a contractual obligation resulting from the loans taken, they could not give rise to criminal liability. This argument was dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. The accused also complained that no criminal offence had been committed, on the grounds that the property in his possession was far greater than the value of his liabilities vis-à-vis creditors.",
                "The [lower] courts, having assessed the evidence in their possession, concluded that this claim was unfounded. The perception of the accused among members of the public as the owner of huge assets was one of the forms of deception he employed to attract large amounts of money from citizens. The court notes that the [lower] courts drew this conclusion on the basis of voluminous documents, explanations provided by experts and the experts ’ reports that were compiled. ... As regards the valuation of objects, their value does not reflect the reality, as the valuation was unilateral and was fictitiously increased compared to the purchase price and the real market value. The District Court reached the same finding via more detailed reasoning.",

Referring to Article 55 of the CC, it decided that the cumulative sentence should not exceed the maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. Consequently, it sentenced the applicant to twenty years ’ imprisonment.

                "“The Tirana District Court convicted the accused of deception and applied Article 143 only once. The Court of Appeal, while finding that the accused ’ s conviction on only one count under Article 143 was unfounded, incorrectly characterised the criminal offence, finding the accused guilty and sentencing him under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. In its decision, the Court of Appeal, relying on Article 3 § 3 of the CC, reasoned that the offence should be classified under Article 143 § 2 of the CC, on the grounds that, as a newly introduced criminal-law provision, the latter was more favourable than the previous provisions.",
                "The argument employed by the District Court that the criminal offence constitutes a continuous crime ... is not borne out by the deception that has been carried out. In order for a crime to be continuous, the following elements must be present: each offence must not stand on its own, the acts or the failure to act must have constituted the same criminal offence, and the criminal intent which joins separate acts in a single integral offence must exist.",
                "In the present case the [lower] courts have accepted that the accused committed different acts over different periods of time. The criminal activity took place over a long time and, as argued above, was not the consequence of the same criminal intent. The latter was subject to continuous modification owing to competition from other unlawful loan-taking companies. This took the form of changing interest rates, varying deception techniques to adapt to different people and different circumstances, developing diverse strategies to make the deception credible, either through propaganda in the broadcast media or through efforts to make the criminal activity appear as normal banking activity.",
                "The court adopts the same position with the unifying decision (no. 284) of 15 September 2000 of the Supreme Court Joint Benches to the effect that persons who have committed the offence of deception shall be criminally liable under Article 143 of the CC on as many counts as the number of people deceived.",
                "The Supreme Court considers that the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning that Article 143 § 2 should be applied as it is more favourable does not have any legal basis. Article 82 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the most serious criminal offence shall be considered to be that which attracts the most severe maximum penalty or, where the most severe maximum penalties are equal, the most severe minimum penalty.” On that basis, taking the most severe maximum penalty as the criterion for the most serious offence, it is clear that Article 143 of the Criminal Code, which was in force when the criminal offence was committed and which provides for a penalty of five years ’ imprisonment, is more favourable than the second paragraph, which was added to the provision and provides for a maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. The fact that the cumulative sentence imposed may be higher than the penalty provided for in Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code cannot provide a basis for finding that Article 143 is less favourable.",
                "For these reasons the Court of Appeal, having aggravated the accused ’ s position, should not have classified the offence under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. The accused ... should be found guilty and sentenced on the basis of Article 143 for the criminal offence of deception on 57,923 counts, equal to the number of injured persons.",
                "The Supreme Court considers the defendant ’ s complaint that his right to defence was breached by the change of characterisation of the criminal offence by the Court of Appeal, contrary to Articles 372, 376/1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 31 (a) of the Constitution, ill-founded. The court, by giving the facts a different determination, may re-characterise the offence, which may be less serious or more so. In the latter case, this does not mean that the accused ’ s position has been aggravated. In accordance with Article 375 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may give the facts a different determination from that given by the prosecutor, since the court is independent and makes its own assessment of the facts.",
                "In this context, Article 375 does not oblige the court to give the accused time in the defence of his interest, whereas pursuant to Article 372, 373 and 374 the accused is granted additional time to secure his defence against new charges lodged by the prosecutor. The latter provisions make reference to the prosecutor who, prior to the completion of the judicial examination has the right to modify the charges, to lodge a different charge or to charge the accused with a new offence. On these occasions, because the defence rights should be secured, the law provides that the court makes time available to the accused to secure his defence against the new charges. In the case of the application of Article 375 of the CCP, when the court proceeds with a different requalification of the offence, the same binding procedure does not apply as in the case of the filing of new charges by the prosecutor. The court, after an examination of facts, may give the facts a new and different legal determination. The criminal procedural law does not envisage adjournment of hearings or granting of [additional] time to the defence when the re-characterisation of the criminal offence is made by the court by virtue of its final decision. Contrary to the defendant ’ s complaint, it cannot be said that there has been a breach of the accused ’ s right to defence.",
                "The spirit of the law (Article 375 of the CCP) has been so that, owing to its amendment by virtue of law no ..., the lawmaker intended to clarify its content. According to the amendment, it is stated that “by way of the final decision the court may give the fact a different determination from that given by the prosecutor or the injured party, which may be more favourable or more serious, provided that it is competent ratione personae to examine the offence.”",
                "The defendant ’ s complaint that the courts did not question all Vefa ’ s creditors is ill-founded. The prosecutor and the courts questioned as many creditors as was deemed necessary. Questioning of creditors does not constitute a legal necessity, since deception is not a criminal offence which can be prosecuted solely on the strength of a complaint. Furthermore, such questioning was not necessary in order to clarify or substantiate the charge against the accused.",
                "The defendant ’ s complaint that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by the Prosecutor General, at the stage of the appeal proceedings before the Court of Appeal, was in breach of Article 27/1 of the CCP, is ill-founded. It results that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by the Prosecutor General was in accordance with Article 27 of the CCP, because according to the Prosecutor General the appeal prosecutor had expressed his prior opinion about the case.",
                "Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the accused should be declared guilty on 57,923 counts of the criminal offence of deception in accordance with Article 143 of the Criminal Code. In passing the sentence, the court takes account of the danger which the accused presents to society, the large number of injured parties and the considerable amount of damage caused and, it considers that the applicant should be sentenced to twenty years ’ imprisonment.”",

                "The rule laid down for the determination of sentences is that the court determines a [separate] sentence for each offence committed by the defendant and, in the end, imposes a cumulative sentence, within the limits provided for by the criminal-law provisions, having regard to the risk posed to society by the perpetrator and any extenuating or aggravating circumstances. The conditions for imposing a cumulative sentence are as follows.",
                "(a) Two or more offences designated by different provisions of the [Criminal] Code must have been committed. None of the offences may be time-barred or have been the subject of an amnesty or of proceedings which were discontinued. For example, a cumulative sentence shall be imposed where the defendant committed intentional homicide by way of the illegal possession of firearms. In determining sentence, the court shall fix the sentence for the offence of intentional homicide and then the sentence for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. The court then imposes a single sentence, not on the basis of arithmetic addition but by imposing the most severe cumulative sentence. More specifically, the court imposes fifteen years ’ imprisonment for the offence of intentional homicide and five years ’ imprisonment for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. By applying a cumulative sentence, the court imposes a penalty of eighteen years ’ imprisonment, which corresponds to the most severe cumulative sentence. This means that three years were added to the most severe sentence of fifteen years ’ imprisonment, resulting in the most severe cumulative sentence of eighteen years ’ imprisonment.",
                "A cumulative sentence cannot be imposed where the same actions, committed repeatedly, form part of a single offence under the [Criminal] Code. For example, serious injury caused to several people, irrespective of the fact that it was inflicted recurrently and by way of the same actions against two, three or more people, forms part of a single offence specifically provided for under Article ... and cannot be subject to a cumulative penalty.",
                "(b) The other condition for the imposition of a cumulative sentence is that no court decision should have been taken in respect of any of the offences. Trial and sentencing must take place at the same time in relation to all the offences. ...",

It finally imposed on him a cumulative sentence of seven years. In this case, the most severe cumulative sentence was correctly applied, in that the sentence did not exceed the total sum of the separate sentences imposed (eight years), or the maximum sentence within the type of penalty imposed, i.e. imprisonment.",

For the first offence, he shall be sentenced to fifteen years ’ imprisonment and for the second to ten years ’ imprisonment.

It follows that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting the applicant for the genocide of Lithuanian partisans, for being part of a political group (see also the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, paragraph 60 above). Moreover, even if the international courts ’ subsequent interpretation of the term “in part” was available in 1953, there is no firm finding in the establishment of the facts by the domestic criminal courts to enable the Court to assess on which basis the domestic courts concluded that in 1953 the Lithuanian partisans constituted a significant part of the national group, in other words, a group protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. That being so, the Court is not convinced that at the relevant time the applicant, even with the assistance of a lawyer, could have foreseen that the killing of the Lithuanian partisans could constitute the offence of genocide of Lithuanian nationals or of ethnic Lithuanians."

                "182. In addition, the Court notes that Article II of the Genocide Convention requires the perpetrator to act with intent to destroy a protected group in whole or in part. The applicant ’ s statements at the relevant time refer to action against “bandits”, the “nationalist underground” and “nationalist gangs” (see paragraphs 18 - 19 above). Moreover, the aims expressed at the MGB meetings in 1953 were directed against these groups. In the Court ’ s view, even if the MGB ’ s policy of extermination extended to “those who help them and their contacts”, the essential goal of this wider group of “Lithuanian nationalists” was to secure independence for the State of Lithuania (see, in this connection, paragraphs 13, 44 and 67 above). Indeed, as the prosecutor noted, and the appellate and cassation courts confirmed, the Lithuanian partisans were fighting against Soviet occupation and for the independence of the Lithuanian State (see paragraphs 29, 39-40 and 44 above). In the light of the above, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s argument is not without weight, namely that his actions, and those of the MGB, were aimed at the extermination of the partisans as a separate and clearly identifiable group, characterised by its armed resistance to Soviet power."

                "183. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the ordinary meaning is to be given to the terms of the treaty. In this regard, it is not immediately obvious that the ordinary meaning of the terms “national” or “ethnic” in the Genocide Convention can be extended to cover partisans. Thus, the Court considers that the domestic courts ’ conclusion that the victims came within the definition of genocide as part of a protected group was an interpretation by analogy, to the applicant ’ s detriment, which rendered his conviction unforeseeable (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A; see also Korbely, cited above, § 70)."

                "184. On this last point, the Court also gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the definition of the crime of genocide in Lithuanian law not only had no basis in the wording of that offence as expressed in the Genocide Convention, but had also been gradually enlarged during the years of Lithuania ’ s independence, thus further aggravating his situation (see paragraphs 51 - 53 and 123 above). It has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court that to prosecute retroactively for the genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group, if the events took place before those two groups were added to the Criminal Code, would be against the rule of law and in breach of Lithuania ’ s obligations under international law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court cannot accept the argument by the Supreme Court that the 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code, expanding the definition of genocide to include “political groups”, could be justified on the basis of Article V of the Genocide Convention. While Article V of the Genocide Convention does not prohibit expanding the definition of genocide, it does not authorise the application of a broader definition of genocide retroactively (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 93, 17 September 2009, and Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 )."

                "185. Consistently with the ICJ in Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (cited above), the Court considers that the gravity of genocide is reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before this conviction is imposed. These requirements – the proof of specific intent and the demonstration that the protected group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part – guard against a danger that convictions for this crime will be imposed lightly (see paragraph 112 above). Noting the Lithuanian courts ’ arguments in the instant case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant ’ s conviction for the crime of genocide could be regarded as consistent with the essence of that offence as defined in international law at the material time and thus could reasonably have been foreseen by him in 1953."

The Soviet repressive structures, embodied in the NKVD (People ’ s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Народный комиссариат внутренних дел ), the MGB (Ministry of State Security, Министерство государственной безопасности ) and other bodies, sought to suppress the resistance. The system of repressive organisations was reorganised on repeated occasions. Most of the leading and operative employees of those structures were non ‑ Lithuanians sent to Lithuania from the USSR.

The trial court noted that the information in the case file allowed it to conclude that, in order to compromise the partisan brothers, the Soviet authorities had spread misinformation which indicated that J.A. and A.A. had deserted from the partisan unit, were hiding alone and, thereafter, had no connection with the partisans. Those accusations were untrue. In reality, the partisans, including the brothers, J.A. and A.A., operated in small groups in order to avoid extermination by the Soviets. Lastly, there was no credible evidence in the case which would disprove the assertion that J.A. and A.A. “were members of the organised resistance and that they belonged to a political group”.

In the MGB files the two brothers had been listed as partisans, members of the armed national underground resistance ( partizanai – nacionalinio ginkluoto pogrindžio dalyviai ). The court dismissed the applicant ’ s contention that he had not actively participated in the operation to capture or to liquidate the two partisans during which those two partisans had died.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the argument by the applicant that the definition of genocide under Lithuanian law, pursuant to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, contradicted the definition enshrined in Article II of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention). The Court of Appeal noted the trial court ’ s conclusion that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had been exterminated for belonging to a “political group”. While admitting that the definition of the crime of genocide in Article 99 of the Criminal Code also included social and political groups, and was therefore wider than that established by the Genocide Convention, the Court of Appeal found that the addition of those groups was “reasonable and in line with reality”. The Genocide Convention did not contain specific provisions to the effect that the concept of genocide could be interpreted widely; however, neither did the Genocide Convention prohibit such an interpretation. The concept of genocide had been expanded in Criminal Codes of other countries. The Court of Appeal further explained that “political group means people connected by common political views and beliefs, and the goal to physically eradicate such a group also means genocide, because this involves an intention to eradicate part of the people [ politinė grupė – tai žmonės, susiję bendromis politinėmis pažiūromis ir įsitikinimais, ir siekimas tokią grupę fiziškai sunaikinti taip pat reiškia genocidą, nes siekiama sunaikinti dalį žmonių ]”. The court emphasised that",
                "“the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, that is to say, participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular ‘ political ’ group, as was done in the trial court ’ s verdict, was in essence only relative/conditional and not very precise. The members of this group had at the same time been representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group. The Soviet genocide was carried out precisely on the criteria of the inhabitants ’ nationality/ethnicity. It follows that Lithuanian partisans could be attributed not only to political, but also to national and ethnic groups, that is to say, to the groups listed in the Genocide Convention.”"

                "37. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s and M.Ž. ’ s contention that their actions did not constitute genocide because at the time of their deaths the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had not been partisans and thus could not have been considered to belong to “a political, social or other group”:",
                "“... The complaints of the convicted, V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž., also contain allegations that during the war the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had collaborated with the German occupying forces and had committed crimes. Furthermore, in 1947 they had deserted from the partisan squad and afterwards did not keep in touch with other partisans. Therefore, in the appellants ’ view, J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered members of any political, social or other group, and actions against them could not have been considered to be acts of genocide. This Chamber is of the view that these arguments have been reasonably rejected by th[is] court and have already been addressed in the judgment of conviction. Both V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž. mention certificate no. 1767 of the Lithuanian Archives Department, dated 13 November 2001. The certificate indicates that the KGB archives contain a criminal case on J.A., and that in the indictment of that case it is written that, when Germany occupied Lithuania, J.A. joined the armed squad of white partisans; he carried weapons and took part in arrests, detention and transportation of active Soviet party members and Jews. Furthermore, he conducted anti-Soviet agitation and made terrorist threats against communists, which means that he has committed the crime provided for in Article 58 1a of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [counter-revolutionary crime and treason of the motherland]. On 4 May 1945 J.A. escaped from prison and joined the partisan squad.",
                "As regards A.A., the certificate indicates that during the German occupation he served in the German police, and in 1944 he began living as an outlaw, joining the armed nationalist partisans ’ unit. It also indicates that in 1947 J.A. and A.A. left the partisan unit and went into hiding alone: they did not keep in touch with other partisans, and by order of the commander of the Tauras partisan unit were considered deserters. In respect of J.A. the same is indicated in the indictment of 16 March 1945 drawn up by the [MGB]. The specific acts that J.A. was accused of were not detailed. It appears that the above documents contain no data about the brothers ’ involvement in particular crimes against humanity. Moreover, given the charges against J.A., it is more likely that he had been accused primarily of carrying out activities against the [USSR] occupying forces themselves. There are no data in the case file about any involvement by the brothers in other criminal acts. Even in KGB documents it is indicated that from 1947 J.A. and A.A. were hiding “without committing robberies, and they did not belong to any [criminal] gang”. The Genocide and Resistance Research Centre ’ s letter entitled “Resistance activity by J.A. and A.A.” indicates that from 1945 they belonged to partisan unit no. 37... According to data from the Šakiai MGB, in 1949 [J.A. and A.A.] still belonged to partisan unit no. 37 ... Afterwards, they left the unit and took no further part in active partisan actions.",
                "In the Chamber ’ s view, the information given does not indicate that until their liquidation J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered Lithuanian partisans. In the judgment of conviction it is rightly noted that during the relevant period partisans had already been forced to fight in small groups to avoid extermination. Even in the MGB files there is an indication that in August 1952 other partisans were looking for an opportunity to meet J.A. and A.A. in order to form a single squad. The MGB therefore decided to spread the rumour that J.A. and A.A. were MGB agents. Specific plans to discredit J.A. and A.A. are apparent from the plan of 12 September 1952 confirmed by the head of the MGB board of Kaunas district ... Witness A.S. testified that in 1952 she met partisans J.A. and A.A. and supplied them with food. In addition, J.A. and A.A. gave her a certificate confirming that she was a supporter of the partisans. She has kept that certificate to this day.",
                "On 18 November 1992 the Office of the Prosecutor General cleared J.A. ’ s name in respect of crimes attributed to him in the indictment of 1 945. The prosecutor indicated that from October 1944 to May 1945 J.A. was unlawfully imprisoned. In 1998 and 2002 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania posthumously granted J.A. and A.A. volunteer-fighter [ kario savanorio ] certificates. It is clear that the MGB itself had considered J.A. and A.A. to be partisans from the report of 11 June 1952, in which the head of the Kaunas MGB informed the LSSR Minister of the Interior that measures had been adopted to ascertain the hiding place of [J.A. and A.A.] and liquidate them. The Šakiai district MGB was to take measures for a speedier liquidation of [J.A. and A.A.]. All this served to prove that when putting those plans into action J.A. and A.A. had been killed as participants in the armed resistance.”",

                "38. On 22 February 2005 the Supreme Court, in cassation proceedings, upheld the conviction of the applicant and M.Ž. As concerns the concept of genocide, the court held as follows.",
                "“Both of those convicted argue that the concept of genocide, as established in Article 99 of the Criminal Code, is broader than the one established in Article II of the Genocide Convention, thus not corresponding to the norms of international law. This argument must be dismissed.",
                "Indeed, Article 99 of the Criminal Code does provide for a broader concept [ platesnė nusikaltimo sudėtis ] of the crime of genocide than that in Article II of the [Genocide] Convention. According to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, genocide also comprises actions aimed at the physical eradication of some or all of the members of a social or political group. Article II of the Convention does not mention such groups.",
                "By acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, the Republic of Lithuania acquired the obligation to ensure that its norms were applied on its territory. Accordingly, by acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, Lithuania acquired the obligation to punish actions aimed at the total or partial destruction of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, and to prevent such actions. Acceding to the [Genocide] Convention does not deprive a State of the right to define actions which are crimes, and to prohibit them [ apibrėžti veikas, kurios yra nusikaltimai, ir jas uždrausti ]. This is even truer because Article V of the [above-mentioned] Convention provides that the Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and to provide penalties for those guilty of genocide or any of the other acts listed in Article III. In Lithuania, this provision has been put into force by enactment of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. The concept of genocide, as established in Article 1 of that law, corresponds to the concept of genocide established in Article II of the Genocide Convention. At the same time, when joining the Convention, in Article 2 of the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Parliament established that the killings and torture of Lithuanian people and their deportations which took place during the years under Nazi German and Soviet occupation and annexation corresponded to the characteristics of the crime of genocide as established by the norms of international law. The 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code established the elements of the crime of genocide [ apibrėžta genocido nusikaltimo sudėtis ], and included acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group. This characteristic of the crime of genocide remained in Article 99 of the Criminal Code. It is clear that adding acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group to the definition of the crime of genocide amounts to nothing more than the execution of the legal norms of Article 2 of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. It follows that the doubts by the applicant and M.Ž. about the interpretation of the concept of the crime of genocide are not founded.”"

The court dismissed arguments by the applicant and M.Ž. that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had deserted from the partisans and that at the time of their death they therefore no longer belonged to the partisans ’ political group.

It further pointed out that under the Law on the status of participants in resistance against the occupations of 1940-1990 ( Pasipriešinimo 1940-1990 metų okupacijoms dalyvių teisinio statuso įstatymas ), enacted on 28 November 1996, the partisans who fought against the occupation had been declared volunteer fighters. In 1998 and 2001 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania granted volunteer-fighter status to J.A. and A.A., which meant that they had met the condition contained in that Law that such status could only be granted to individuals who had not committed crimes against humanity or had not killed civilians."

Vasiliauskas took part in the killing of Lithuanian partisans, J.A. and A.A.: he and other MGB officers surrounded the bunker and attacked it; during the attack J.A. and A.A. were shot and killed. The trial court ’ s verdict does not state that V. Vasiliauskas himself killed any of the partisans, although data to that effect exist in the case file (the 2 January 1953 report by the head of the Šakiai district MGB).",
                "Participation in killing people who belong to a political group is one of the objective elements [ vienas iš nusikaltimo sudėties objektyviosios pusės požymių ] of the crime of genocide listed in Article 99 of the Criminal Code. Involvement in the killing of members of the groups listed in Article 99 means not only committing acts causing loss of life, but also setting conditions [ sudarymas sąlygų ] so that the killings happen. It has been established that V. Vasiliauskas, as an MGB officer, together with an MGB subsection chief, took part in preparations for the operation to exterminate J.A. and A.A.; V. Vasiliauskas was armed, and during the operation he was responsible for the MGB agent [M.Ž.], who had located the partisans ’ bunker; V. Vasiliauskas stayed with M.Ž. until the end of the operation. V. Vasiliauskas himself acknowledges those actions. Having taken the above into account, the Court of Appeal arrived at the reasonable conclusion that V. Vasiliauskas had played an active role in the operation of the extermination of partisans J.A. and A.A. Even though it has not been established that V. Vasiliauskas killed either of the partisans himself, the actions he took when preparing the operation and at the time of the operation correspond to the objective element of the crime of genocide, as established in Article 99 of the Criminal Code – involvement in killing people who belong to a political group.",
                "The actions of V. Vasiliauskas also correspond to the subjective element of genocide – direct intent [ tiesioginė tyčia ]: V. Vasiliauskas, when taking those actions, had known the goal of the Soviet government – to eradicate all Lithuanian partisans. He knew that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., were partisans, and understood that during the operation they would be killed or arrested and then tortured, tried as ‘ traitors to the homeland ’ and [possibly] sentenced to death, and [V.

[2] It transpires from the Court of Appeal ’ s decision seeking the guidance of the Constitutional Court that, on 9 June 2011, the Kaunas Regional Court had found the applicant guilty of genocide in another criminal case which also concerned the genocide of the Lithuanian partisans. The trial court in that case established that from 15 September 1952 the applicant had served as an operational agent in the occupational structure, the Šakiai district MGB, and “knew its main goal, namely to physically eliminate a part of the inhabitants of Lithuania belonging to a separate national, ethnic and political group, that is, the Lithuanian partisans”. On the night of 23 March 1953, the applicant, acting together with the commanding officers of the Kaunas region Šakiai district MGB and with the aim of killing or capturing and deporting the partisans who were hiding at a house in the Šakiai district, took part in an operation in which partisan J.B. was injured and arrested. On 20 July 1953 the Vilnius region MGB military tribunal sentenced the partisan in question to twenty-five years of deprivation of liberty. In August 1953 the partisan was deported from Lithuania to a special camp within the territory of the former USSR. The trial court thus held that, through those actions the applicant had taken part in the partisan ’ s deportation from Lithuania to the territory of the occupying State, thereby unlawfully imprisoning the partisan in a prison camp ( lageryje )."

On 18 March 2014 the Constitutional Court gave a ruling on whether the crime of genocide, as defined in the Criminal Code, and the possibility to punish that crime retroactively, were compatible with the Constitution. The court held that Article 99 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates that actions aimed at the physical destruction, in whole or in part, of persons belonging to any national, ethnic, racial, religious, and also social or political group, could be considered genocide, was compatible with the Constitution. Having reviewed the relevant international-law instruments, including the case-law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Constitutional Court took the view that States have a certain discretion, because of particular historical, political, social and cultural contexts, to establish in their domestic law a broader definition of the crime of genocide than that which is established in international law. Thus, political and social groups may be included in the definition of genocide (see point 3.7 of the ruling, Chapter II, part of the reasoning)."

                "59. The Constitutional Court also noted that, according to the conclusions of historians, Lithuanians, together with Latvians and Estonians, as well as some other nations which lived in the territory of the USSR (Germans, Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, the Ingush) were considered to be persons belonging to the “untrustworthy” nations. On account of their nationality, the persons belonging to “untrustworthy” nations were doomed to extermination, inter alia, by means of unbearable living conditions in exile. The Constitutional Court held as follows (here and further below, translation into English by the Constitutional Court itself).",
                "“6.3. Thus, with consideration of such an international and historical context, inter alia, the aforesaid ideology of the totalitarian communist regime of the USSR upon which the extermination of entire groups of people was grounded, the scale of repressions of the USSR against residents of the Republic of Lithuania, which was a part of the targeted policy of the extermination of the basis of Lithuania ’ s political nation and of the targeted policy of the treatment of Lithuanians as an ‘ unreliable ’ nation, the conclusion should be drawn that, during a certain period (in 1941, when mass deportations of Lithuanians to the Soviet Union began and non-judicial executions of detained persons were carried out, and in 1944-1953, when mass repressions were carried out during the guerrilla war against the occupation of the Republic of Lithuania), the crimes perpetrated by the Soviet occupation regime, in case of the proof of the existence of a special purpose aimed at destroying, in whole or in part, any national, ethnic, racial or religious group, might be assessed as genocide as defined according to the universally recognised norms of international law ( inter alia, according to the Convention Against Genocide). As mentioned before, under the universally recognised norms of international law, actions are considered to constitute genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying, not only in whole but also in part, any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group; when a part of the protected group is targeted, that part must be significant enough for its destruction to have an impact on the group as a whole; actions may also be recognised as genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying certain social or political groups that constitute a significant part of any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group and the destruction of which would have an impact on the respective national, ethnical, racial, or religious group as a whole. It has also been mentioned that the physical destruction of the group is the likely outcome of a forcible transfer of the population when this transfer is conducted in such a way that the group can no longer reconstitute itself – particularly when it involves the separation of its members; in such cases, the forcible transfer of individuals could lead to the destruction of the group, since the group ceases to exist as a group or, at least, as the group it was”.",
                "The Constitutional Court then held as follows.",
                "“In other words, it has been mentioned that, according to the universally recognised norms of international law, the actions carried out during a certain period against certain political and social groups of the residents of the Republic of Lithuania might be considered to constitute genocide if such actions – provided this has been proved – were aimed at destroying the groups that represented a significant part of the Lithuanian nation and whose destruction had an impact on the survival of the entire Lithuanian nation. It should be noted that, in case of the absence of any proof of such an aim, in its turn it should not mean that, for their actions against residents of Lithuania (e.g., their killing, torturing, deportation, forced recruitment to the armed forces of an occupying State, persecution for political, national, or religious reasons), respective persons should not be punished according to laws of the Republic of Lithuania and universally recognised norms of international law; in view of concrete circumstances, one should assess whether those actions entail crimes against humanity or war crimes.",
                "6.4. In this context it should be noted that, as mentioned before, the Preamble to the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania of 9 April 1992 held, inter alia, that the policy of genocide and of crimes against humanity which was carried out against the residents of Lithuania was accomplished at the time of the occupation and annexation by the Nazi Germany or the USSR; Article 2 of the same law established that ‘ [t]he killing, torturing and deportation of inhabitants of Lithuania committed during the occupation and annexation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany or the USSR shall be classified as a crime of genocide as defined by international law ’.",
                "6.5. To sum up, it should be noted that the inclusion of social and political groups into the definition of genocide in Article 99 of the [Criminal Code] that is being impugned by the petitioners was determined by a concrete legal and historical context – the international crimes committed by the occupation regimes in the Republic of Lithuania.”"

                "60. The Constitutional Court also held that Article 95 of the Criminal Code, which provides that there is no statute of limitations for genocide (including genocide of social and political groups), was compatible with the Constitution. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, the Constitution allows such legal regulation when the statute of limitations is not applicable to prosecute the most serious crimes, genocide against social or political groups being one of them. The Constitutional Court then observed that, in the light of the obligation under Article 135 § 1 of the Constitution to adhere to Lithuania ’ s obligations stemming from the universally recognised international-law norms prohibiting such crimes as genocide, Lithuanian laws could not set a lower standard than those provided by international law. However, the principle of the rule of law, and thus the principles of nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege, would be breached if Lithuanian criminal legislation allowed retroactive punishment for crimes which have been defined only in accordance with the domestic law, in this case, for genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group. In other words, retroactive prosecution for genocide of social or political groups, when the genocide took place before the Criminal Code amendments of 21 April 1998, would be in breach of the Constitution and the principle of the rule of law."

                "“6.2. According to various data, due to the both occupations carried out by the USSR, the Republic of Lithuania lost almost one fifth of its population, including refugees. According to the data presented by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania, during the period of the Soviet occupation (1940-1941 and 1944 ‑ 1990), in all, 85,000 Lithuanian inhabitants perished or were killed, around 132,000 Lithuanian inhabitants were deported to the Soviet Union (at the time of the deportations of 1945-1952, 32,000 of the deportees were children). From among those perished or killed, 20,000 were participants of the armed resistance against the occupation (partisans) and their supporters (data for 1944-1952), around 1,100 – shot or tortured to death in June 1941 when the Soviet armed forces were retreating from Lithuania, around 35-37,000 political prisoners perished in special camps and prisons, and around 28,000 deportees perished in exile; on 14 June 1941, the first mass deportation of citizens of the Republic of Lithuania to Siberia began (all in all, 12,000 people were exiled then); one of the biggest repressions against the civil population was carried out in 1944-1946: up to 130,000 Lithuanian inhabitants were detained and arrested, 32,000 were repressed and transferred to special camps and prisons, around 108,400 were recruited to the USSR troops by force in 1944-1945. During the 1944-1953 partisan war against the occupation, all in all, 186,000 people were arrested and imprisoned.",
                "It is obvious from these numbers that, in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, the Soviet occupation regime perpetrated international crimes that could be qualified, according to the universally recognised norms of international law ( inter alia, the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal), as crimes against humanity (killing and extermination of civilians, deportation of residents, their imprisonment and persecution on political and national grounds, etc.) and war crimes (killing and deportation of persons protected under international humanitarian law, forced recruitment of residents of an occupied territory to the armed forces of an occupying State, etc.).",
                "It needs to be emphasised that, according to the research conducted by historians, the crimes against the residents of the Republic of Lithuania were a part of the targeted and systematic totalitarian policy pursued by the USSR: the repressions against the residents of Lithuania were not in any manner coincidental and chaotic, but rather, such repressions sought to exterminate the basis of the political nation of Lithuania, inter alia, the former social and political structure of the State of Lithuania. Those repressions were directed against the most active political and social groups of the residents of the Republic of Lithuania: participants of the resistance against the occupation and their supporters, civil servants and officials of the State of Lithuania, Lithuanian public figures, intellectuals and the academic community, farmers, priests, and members of the families of those groups. It should be noted that, by means of the repressions, the occupation regime sought to exterminate, to cause harm and break those people: they were victims of non-judicial executions, they were imprisoned and sent to special camps for forced labour, they were deported to faraway harsh-climate sparsely populated places of the Soviet Union by purposefully creating intolerable life conditions that posed constant threat to one ’ s life and health.”"

Thus, in consideration of the international and historical context, it should be noted that, in the course of the qualification of the actions against the participants of the resistance against the Soviet occupation as a political group, one should take into account the significance of this group for the entire respective national group (the Lithuanian nation) which is covered by the definition of genocide according to the universally recognised norms of international law.",

As regards the participants (partisans) of the armed resistance of the Republic of Lithuania against the Soviet occupation, account must also be taken of the fact that the Soviet Union, while ignoring the universally recognised norms of international law, neither recognised their status of combatants and prisoners of war nor provided them with the corresponding international guarantees related to such a status; from the conclusions of the historians that investigated documents of the repressive structures of the interior and security of the USSR it is clear that those structures pursued the targeted policy of the extermination of ‘ bandits ’, ‘ terrorists ’, and ‘ bourgeois nationalists ’ to which they also ascribed the Lithuanian partisans, inter alia, special ‘ extermination ’ squads were established and they were used in the fight against the Lithuanian partisans and their supporters.”"

If a group has its leadership exterminated, and at the same time or in the wake of that, has a relatively large number of the members of the group killed or subjected to other heinous acts, for example deported on a large scale or forced to flee, the cluster of violations ought to be considered in its entirety in order to interpret the provisions of the Convention in a spirit consistent with its purpose.

The Trial Chamber is therefore of the opinion that the intent to destroy a group, even if only in part, means seeking to destroy a distinct part of the group as opposed to an accumulation of isolated individuals within it. Although the perpetrators of genocide need not seek to destroy the entire group protected by the Convention, they must view the part of the group they wish to destroy as a distinct entity which must be eliminated as such. A campaign resulting in the killings, in different places spread over a broad geographical area, of a finite number of members of a protected group might not thus qualify as genocide, despite the high total number of casualties, because it would not show an intent by the perpetrators to target the very existence of the group as such. ...”"

The numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point, though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry. The number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms, but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group. In addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion, its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration.

The United Nations Expert Study on Genocide defines the term ‘ in part ’ as implying ‘ a reasonably significant number, relative to the total of the group as a whole, or else a significant section of a group such as its leadership ’.

The Chamber believes that it is more appropriate to speak of a ‘ reasonably substantial ’ rather than a ‘ reasonably significant ’ number. This part of the definition calls for evidence of an intention to destroy a reasonably substantial number relative to the total population of the group. According to this definition, if that criterion is not met, the mens rea may yet be established by evidence of an intention to destroy a significant section of the group, such as its leadership. While the Chamber does not reject that aspect of the definition, which sees the two elements as being alternative, there may be situations in which the inference as to the intent can not be drawn on the basis of the evidence in relation to each element in isolation, but when the evidence in relation to each is viewed as a whole, it would be perfectly proper to draw the inference.",

Zdravko Tolimir (ICTY-05-88/2-T, trial judgment, 12 December 2012), the majority of the ICTY Trial Chamber considered, with regard to the killing of three leaders of the Žepa Bosnian Muslim enclave (the mayor of the municipality, who was also a religious leader, the military commander and the head of the civil protection unit), that “[w]hile the individuals killed were only three in numbers, in view of the size of Žepa, they constituted the core of its civilian and military leadership” (ibid., § 780). Therefore, their killing “ was a case of deliberate destruction of a limited number of persons selected for the impact that their disappearance would have on the survival of the group as such” (ibid., § 782). Moreover, the killing of one of those three persons, who at the time enjoyed a special status as the defender of the Bosnian Muslim population of Žepa, had a symbolic purpose for the survival of the Bosnian Muslims of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. On that basis and also taking into account the forcible transfer of the remaining population of Žepa, the majority of the Trial Chamber was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Bosnian Serb forces had killed the three leaders of the Žepa enclave with the specific genocidal intent of destroying part of the Bosnian Muslim population as such."

Genocide as ‘ the denial of the existence of entire human groups ’ was contrasted with homicide, ‘ the denial of the right to live of individual human beings ’ by the General Assembly in its 1946 resolution 96 (I) cited in the Preamble to the Convention. The drafters of the Convention also gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude. The Court spoke to the same effect in 1951 in declaring as an object of the Convention the safeguarding of ‘ the very existence of certain human groups ’ ( Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23). Such an understanding of genocide requires a positive identification of the group. The rejection of proposals to include within the Convention political groups and cultural genocide also demonstrates that the drafters were giving close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing well-established, some said immutable, characteristics. A negatively defined group cannot be seen in that way. ”"

The Chamber notes that the concepts of national, ethnical, racial and religious groups have been researched extensively and that, at present, there are no generally and internationally accepted precise definitions thereof. Each of these concepts must be assessed in the light of a particular political, social and cultural context. Moreover, the Chamber notes that for the purposes of applying the Genocide Convention, membership of a group is, in essence, a subjective rather than an objective concept. The victim is perceived by the perpetrator of genocide as belonging to a group slated for destruction. In some instances, the victim may perceive himself/herself as belonging to the said group.",

It appears, from a reading of the travaux préparatoires of the Genocide Convention, that certain groups, such as political and economic groups, have been excluded from the protected groups, because they are considered to be ‘ mobile groups ’ which one joins through individual, political commitment. That would seem to suggest a contrario that the Convention was presumably intended to cover relatively stable and permanent groups.",

The latter are intended to safeguard basic human values by banning atrocities directed against human dignity. One fails to see why only civilians and not also combatants should be protected by these rules (in particular by the rule prohibiting persecution), given that these rules may be held to possess a broader humanitarian scope and purpose than those prohibiting war crimes. However, faced with the explicit limitation laid down in Article 5, the Trial Chamber holds that a broad interpretation should nevertheless be placed on the word ‘ civilians ’, the more so because the limitation in Article 5 constitutes a departure from customary international law.",

As to partisans, the Government stated that during the resistance between 1940 and 1941 and 1944 and 1953, some 20,000 partisans had been killed and a large number of their supporters imprisoned or deported to Siberia. The repressive USSR institutions had employed a number of severe measures to suppress the underground movement: deportations of families of resistance members, torture of resistance members, acts of psychological warfare or terror and punitive actions against resistance members and their supporters, such as the burning of villages and extrajudicial executions. Most of these measures were applied in clear breach of international law, and of the Constitution of the USSR and other Soviet laws. In particular, the Constitutional Court had noted that the USSR did not regard partisans as having the status of combatants or prisoners of war and did not accord to them the international guarantees related to such status."

That the Soviet policy was criminal and that its regime committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Lithuania are established historical facts. In this connection, the Government referred to Resolution 1481 (2006) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the need for international condemnation of crimes of totalitarian communist regimes (see paragraph 89 above). Furthermore, they noted the fact that the crimes, including genocide, perpetrated by the Soviet totalitarian communist regime had been recognised by laws of the Russian Federation itself as, for example, in the Law on rehabilitation of the repressed peoples of 26 April 1991 (see paragraph 74 above)."

Furthermore, the Government relied upon UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, adopted unanimously and without debate, which had affirmed that genocide was a crime under international law and had noted that “crimes of genocide have occurred when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part”.

The Soviet regime sought to annihilate the culture, religion, language, politics and identity of the Lithuanian nation, with the aim of eliminating it as a group. The Court of Appeal had thus rightly concluded that J.A. and A.A. could not only be regarded as members of a political group (as the trial court had done), but also as belonging to two groups specifically protected by the Genocide Convention, namely, a national and an ethnic group.

According to Professor Antonio Cassese, at least two sub-classes of crimes against humanity could be distinguished under the Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal (“the Nuremberg Principles”) : firstly, crimes committed against civilians within the framework of a widespread or systematic practice of gross violations of fundamental human rights; and, secondly, crimes of persecution against a particular group of persons, whether civilian or military, in pursuance of a discriminatory or persecutory policy or practice based on religious, racial, ethnic or political grounds ( A. Cassese, P. Gaeta, J.R.W.D. Jones (eds), The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002 ).

The Russian Government noted that the present case was not the first time the Court had been called upon to rule on the issue of the compatibility of an applicant ’ s conviction in the Baltic States with the provisions of Article 7 of the Convention. The core of such cases was the prosecution of the applicants for acts that they allegedly committed in the 1940s and 1950s at the time when, according to the Russian Government, the Baltic States formed an integral part of the USSR (they referred to Kolk and Kislyiy, cited above; Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, ECHR 2010; and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), no. 19363/05, 4 January 2008). They contended that in order to substantiate the “legitimacy” of the applicant ’ s conviction the Lithuanian Government had relied on a distorted historical description of “atrocities” by the Soviet government in the Baltic States. Furthermore, their observations were “supersaturated” with numerous questionable facts, which they adduced in an attempt to support their unfounded assertion that the Soviet authorities had perpetrated “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (“the LSSR”). The Russian Government objected to what they considered to be a blatant distortion of historical realities and the obvious intention of the Baltic governments to modify history in accordance with their own preferences at the expense of the people whose activities in the past did not correspond to the official point of view of the present-day national authorities."

After the withdrawal of the German troops in 1944, parts of the local population refused to disarm and, instead, chose the path of military resistance to the Soviet army. These were mainly persons who had collaborated with the Nazis. The illegal armed groups were lawfully combated by the Soviet army and prosecuted by the Soviet government of the LSSR, which was the only internationally recognised authority on that territory after 1945.

However, actions that may have been targeted against these “newly protected groups” should not be exempt from the restrictions enshrined in Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Such actions may constitute a crime only if committed after the introduction of the expanded definition of genocide, unless they were already punishable under international law in force at the material time.

The fact that Raphael Lemkin, the scholar who first conceptualised the term and whom the Lithuanian Government extensively cited in their written submissions, considered that “genocide” meant “the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group” was also relevant (R. Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, 1944, p. 79). There was no evidence that political groups were granted special protection by the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations in 1953.

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Kononov, cited above, § 185, and Del Río Prada v.

It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Korbely v.

It stated that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was consistent with the essence of that offence “must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable”, although, exceptionally, an applicant could rely on a particular interpretation of the provision being taken by the domestic courts in the special circumstances of the case.

This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying out a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation.

Pursuant to Article 6 (c) of the Charter, extermination, deportation and other inhuman acts against any civilian population, including persecutions on political grounds, were defined as crimes against humanity. On 11 December 1946 the UN General Assembly condemned the crime of genocide by adopting Resolution 96 (I). The Genocide Convention, affirming the principles of international law recognised by that Resolution, was adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1948. The USSR signed the Genocide Convention on 16 December 1949. After twenty instruments of ratification or accession had been deposited, the Convention came into force on 12 January 1951. The Court further observes that in the Advisory Opinion on the Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( ICJ Reports 1951) the International Court of Justice (ICJ) pointed out that the principles underlying the Genocide Convention are principles which are recognised by civilised nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obligation (see paragraph 80 above)."

The Court begins by noting that the crime of genocide prohibited by Article II of the Genocide Convention lists four protected groups of persons: national, ethnic, racial and religious. That provision does not refer to social or political groups. Furthermore, the travaux préparatoires disclose an intention by the drafters not to include political groups in the list of those protected by the Genocide Convention. The ICJ, when examining the drafting history of Article II of the Genocide Convention in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro ), Judgment of 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007 ), observed that the drafters of the Convention “gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude” (see paragraph 105 above). The Court finds no convincing arguments for departing from the treaty definition of genocide as established in 1948, including the list of the four protected groups referred to therein. On the contrary, all references to the crime of genocide in subsequent international-law instruments – the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968, the ICTY Statute of 1993, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) of 1994, as well as in the most recent international-law instrument – the ICC Statute of 1998 – describe that crime in similar, if not identical, terms. In particular, genocide is defined as acts committed to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, without reference to political groups (see paragraphs 83 and 85-87 above). In the Court ’ s view, the fact that certain States decided later to criminalise genocide of a political group in their domestic laws (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above) does not, as such, alter the reality that the text of the Genocide Convention did not do so."

It is clear from the Court ’ s earlier finding in relation to the accessibility of the offence that in 1953 genocide was already a crime under international customary law (see paragraph 168 above). The indictment of October 1945 before the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, as well as certain prosecutors ’ oral submissions, charged the defendants with genocide, the significance of which is not necessarily undermined by the fact that the final judgment made no mention of the crime of genocide. UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, adopted unanimously and without debate, affirmed the existence of the international crime of genocide. There followed several references in indictments to the crime of genocide, and convictions for crimes with genocidal purposes in the post-Nuremberg trials under Control Council Law no. 10 [9] as well as in the trials by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland (1946-48) of Hoess and Greiser [10]. Article 1 of the Genocide Convention “confirmed” that genocide was a crime under international law. The ICJ later referred to Resolution 96 (I) and confirmed that the principles underlying the Genocide Convention were recognised by civilised nations as binding on States even without any conventional obligation (see paragraph 80 above)."

                "174. Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term “genocide”, proposed a broad definition of the offence. In his 1944 book [11] he addressed crimes against national groups but accepted that genocide could comprise acts aimed at destroying the national group by destroying its political institutions, culture and livelihood. The later UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) called for the preparation of a genocide Convention to protect “racial, religious, political groups and other groups”. Certain authors considered that that Resolution reflects a customary jus cogens prohibition of genocide [12] while others have questioned this view [13]. Some authors were also of the view that the final list of groups to be protected by the Genocide Convention was the result of political expediency and not the result of a principled reflection based on some philosophical or other distinction between certain types of groups. [14] In the late 1940s some commentators also expressed concern that the exclusion of political and economic groups would mean that the Genocide Convention could not address acts committed by the Soviet authorities against property owners. [15] Other authors, however, disagreed that the exclusion of political groups was the result of Soviet pressure. [16]"

Having regard to the factors outlined above, the Court finds that there are some arguments to the effect that political groups were protected by customary international law on genocide in 1953. However, there are equally strong contemporaneous countervailing views. At this juncture, the Court reiterates that notwithstanding those views favouring the inclusion of political groups in the definition of genocide, the scope of the codified definition of genocide remained narrower in the Genocide Convention and was retained in all subsequent international-law instruments (see paragraph 170 above). In sum, the Court finds that there is no sufficiently strong basis for finding that customary international law as it stood in 1953 included “political groups” among those falling within the definition of genocide.",

                "176. The Court next turns to the Government ’ s submission that because of their prominence the Lithuanian partisans were “part” of the national group, that is, a group protected by Article II of the Genocide Convention. In this connection, the Court notes that in 1953 there was no case-law by any international tribunal to provide a judicial interpretation of the definition of genocide. The travaux préparatoires to the Genocide Convention provide little guidance on what the drafters meant by the term “in part”. The early commentators of the Genocide Convention emphasised that the term “in part” contained a substantiality requirement (see paragraph 93 above). The Genocide Convention itself provides that the crime is characterised by an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, ... [a] group, as such”, and the substantiality requirement is supported by Resolution 96 (I) according to which “[g]enocide is the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups”. Bearing in mind that the goal of the Genocide Convention was to deal with mass crimes, the ICTY noted the wide acknowledgment that the intention to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group (see paragraph 98 above). The gravity of genocide is further reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before a conviction is imposed – the demanding proof of specific intent and demonstrating that the group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part (see paragraph 106 above). The Court therefore considers it reasonable to find that in 1953 it was foreseeable that the term “in part” contained a requirement as to substantiality."

            [
                "177. That said, however, the Court is mindful of subsequent developments in international case-law on the crime of genocide. Half a century after the events for which the applicant was convicted, judicial guidance as to the interpretation of the phrase “in part” emerged when cases concerning genocide were brought before the ICTY, ICTR and ICJ. In particular, as transpires from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 97 to 108 above, the intentional destruction of a “distinct” part of a protected group could be considered to be genocide of the entire protected group, provided that the “distinct” part was substantial because of the very large number of its members. Furthermore, in addition to the numerical size of the targeted part, judicial interpretation confirmed that its “prominence” within the protected group could also be a useful consideration. Be that as it may, this interpretation of the phrase “in part” could not have been foreseen by the applicant at the relevant time."

In sum, the Court finds that in 1953 international treaty law did not include a “political group” in the definition of genocide, nor can it be established with sufficient clarity that customary international law provided for a broader definition of genocide than that set out in Article II of the 1948 Genocide Convention.",

                "179. The Court next turns to the Lithuanian courts ’ interpretation of the crime of genocide in the applicant ’ s case. It notes that the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged by the prosecutor, that is, guilty of the genocide of Lithuanian partisans as members of a separate political group (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above). The Court of Appeal, for its part, rephrased the applicant ’ s conviction, holding that the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, as participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular “political” group, was “only relative/conditional and not very precise”. For the Court of Appeal, the Lithuanian partisans had also been “representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group” (see paragraphs 35 and 36 in fine above). Even so, the Court of Appeal did not explain what the notion “representatives” entailed. Nor did it provide much historical or factual account as to how the Lithuanian partisans were representing the Lithuanian nation. Nor does the partisans ’ specific mantle with regard to the “national” group appear to have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which acknowledged that the applicant was “convicted of involvement in the physical extermination of a part of the Lithuanian inhabitants who belonged to a separate political group”, merely observed that between 1944 and 1953 the nation ’ s armed resistance against the Soviet occupying regime – the partisan war – took place in Lithuania (see paragraphs 39-40 above)."

                "180. For its part, the Constitutional Court also acknowledged that the organised armed resistance against Soviet occupation was to be regarded as self-defence of the State of Lithuania. The partisans had led the political and military national struggle for freedom."

                "181. The Court accepts that the domestic authorities have discretion to interpret the definition of genocide more broadly than that contained in the Genocide Convention. However, such discretion does not permit domestic tribunals to convict persons accused under that broader definition retrospectively. The Court has already established that in 1953 political groups were excluded from the definition of genocide under international law (see paragraph 178 above). It follows that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting the applicant for the genocide of Lithuanian partisans, for being part of a political group (see also the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, paragraph 60 above). Moreover, even if the international courts ’ subsequent interpretation of the term “in part” was available in 1953, there is no firm finding in the establishment of the facts by the domestic criminal courts to enable the Court to assess on which basis the domestic courts concluded that in 1953 the Lithuanian partisans constituted a significant part of the national group, in other words, a group protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. That being so, the Court is not convinced that at the relevant time the applicant, even with the assistance of a lawyer, could have foreseen that the killing of the Lithuanian partisans could constitute the offence of genocide of Lithuanian nationals or of ethnic Lithuanians."
            ],
            [
                "182. In addition, the Court notes that Article II of the Genocide Convention requires the perpetrator to act with intent to destroy a protected group in whole or in part. The applicant ’ s statements at the relevant time refer to action against “bandits”, the “nationalist underground” and “nationalist gangs” (see paragraphs 18 - 19 above). Moreover, the aims expressed at the MGB meetings in 1953 were directed against these groups. In the Court ’ s view, even if the MGB ’ s policy of extermination extended to “those who help them and their contacts”, the essential goal of this wider group of “Lithuanian nationalists” was to secure independence for the State of Lithuania (see, in this connection, paragraphs 13, 44 and 67 above). Indeed, as the prosecutor noted, and the appellate and cassation courts confirmed, the Lithuanian partisans were fighting against Soviet occupation and for the independence of the Lithuanian State (see paragraphs 29, 39-40 and 44 above). In the light of the above, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s argument is not without weight, namely that his actions, and those of the MGB, were aimed at the extermination of the partisans as a separate and clearly identifiable group, characterised by its armed resistance to Soviet power."

In this regard, it is not immediately obvious that the ordinary meaning of the terms “national” or “ethnic” in the Genocide Convention can be extended to cover partisans. Thus, the Court considers that the domestic courts ’ conclusion that the victims came within the definition of genocide as part of a protected group was an interpretation by analogy, to the applicant ’ s detriment, which rendered his conviction unforeseeable (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A; see also Korbely, cited above, § 70)."

On this last point, the Court also gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the definition of the crime of genocide in Lithuanian law not only had no basis in the wording of that offence as expressed in the Genocide Convention, but had also been gradually enlarged during the years of Lithuania ’ s independence, thus further aggravating his situation (see paragraphs 51 - 53 and 123 above). It has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court that to prosecute retroactively for the genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group, if the events took place before those two groups were added to the Criminal Code, would be against the rule of law and in breach of Lithuania ’ s obligations under international law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court cannot accept the argument by the Supreme Court that the 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code, expanding the definition of genocide to include “political groups”, could be justified on the basis of Article V of the Genocide Convention. While Article V of the Genocide Convention does not prohibit expanding the definition of genocide, it does not authorise the application of a broader definition of genocide retroactively (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 93, 17 September 2009, and Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 )."

These requirements – the proof of specific intent and the demonstration that the protected group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part – guard against a danger that convictions for this crime will be imposed lightly (see paragraph 112 above). Noting the Lithuanian courts ’ arguments in the instant case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant ’ s conviction for the crime of genocide could be regarded as consistent with the essence of that offence as defined in international law at the material time and thus could reasonably have been foreseen by him in 1953."

This argument is inconsistent with the travaux préparatoires which imply that Article 7 § 1 can be considered to contain the general rule of non-retroactivity and that Article 7 § 2 is only a contextual clarification of the liability limb of that rule, included so as to ensure that there was no doubt about the validity of prosecutions after the Second World War in respect of the crimes committed during that war (see Kononov, cited above, § 186). It is thus clear that the drafters of the Convention did not intend to allow for any general exception to the rule of non-retroactivity.

It held that the second applicant had taken advantage of insider information that Russian Post had ceased to provide the companies with certain services for lack of operational capacity and had convinced those clients to use GPA as a substitute; that he had misled the clients about GPA ’ s pricing policy and its relationship with Russian Post, thus depriving them of the freedom of choice of service providers; that he had promoted his company ’ s services while knowing that it would have to subcontract the work to other companies; and that GPA had retained the difference in price between what MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok paid for its services and what GPA paid to its subcontractors.

According to the Government, he had contacted Russian Post ’ s counterparties and deliberately misled them and had induced them to sign an agreement with his own company, GPA. That had resulted in damage to Russian Post ’ s former business partners, in particular MPK, which had amounted to RUB 4,493,186.88. To justify that finding, the court had referred to the difference in prices between what GPA charged and what it had paid to its subcontractors, considering that margin to be indicative of fraud. The fact that GPA had entered into an agreement to provide services but had intended to use subcontractors rather than its own logistics facilities had been considered by the court as constituting an element of fraud."

The Government submitted that the reclassification had been correct and within the limits of the original charges because commercial fraud was a type of fraud.

The Government argued that the charges and acts imputed to the applicants had in essence remained within the original scope of the charges and that the applicants ’ defence had not been put at a disadvantage.

                "54. The Court reiterates that the guarantee enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention is an essential element of the rule of law. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 92, 17 September 2009, and Huhtamäki v. Finland, no. 54468/09, § 41, 6 March 2012 ). Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 32 ‑ 33, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 34-35, Series A no. 335 ‑ B; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, §§ 91 ‑ 93, ECHR 2013). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see, among others, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, § 50; K.-H. W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 45, ECHR 2001-II; and Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 51, ECHR 2015 )."

The courts concluded that the latter margin constituted the amount stolen by the applicants from MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok through GPA and classified it as proceeds from criminal activity; consequently, the use of those proceeds for paying GPA ’ s office rent, for legal services, dividends to the applicants and transfers to affiliated companies constituted money laundering."

It defined “commercial fraud” as fraud committed in conjunction with deliberate non-compliance with contractual obligations in the commercial sphere. According to Article 159, “fraud” is the “theft of another ’ s property or acquisition of the right to another ’ s property by way of deception or abuse of trust”. The courts referred to the applicants ’ acts as “theft” rather than “acquisition of the right to another ’ s property”. The term “theft” is, in turn, defined in the note to Article 158 § 1 as “the unlawful taking or appropriating of another person ’ s property committed for motives of personal gain and in the absence of consideration, which benefits the perpetrator or others and which has caused damage to the owner or other holder of such property”."

Having regard to the specific criminal acts listed above, the Court notes that the applicants ’ fraudulent conduct, as defined by the domestic courts, included setting up a fake company, GPA, with the criminal intention to defraud clients of Russian Post. The Court observes that acting against the interests of Russian Post, for example by using insider information to direct subcontracts to a company owned by the applicants even though one of the applicants was employed by Russian Post, has never been imputed to the applicants: the sole victims of the “theft” were the two client companies. The Court therefore has to examine whether the conclusions reached by the domestic courts concerning the nature of GPA ’ s relationship with its clients, defined as containing elements of deception or abuse of trust, failure to recompense, and non-compliance with contractual obligations, were based on an analysis which could be considered as arguably reasonable and, consequently, whether it was foreseeable that the applicants ’ acts could constitute commercial fraud against those companies."

The Court notes that the second applicant was found liable on account of GPA ’ s agreements with MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok and for the failure to comply with the contractual obligations set out therein. It observes that the terms “contractual obligations” and “commercial sphere”, used in Article 159.4 to distinguish this kind of fraud from general fraud, derived from the Civil Code, which regulated the activities of commercial entities and their liability in private-law transactions. As such, Article 159.4 called for an interpretation based on, or concordant with, the principles established by the Civil Code in relation to the functioning of commercial entities and their rights and obligations relating to the conclusion and execution of contracts and for breach of contract. However, in the present case the courts adopted an alternative interpretation of Article 159.4 on the basis of Article 159 as a lex generalis, which contained basic definitions and the constituent elements of fraud. Under this alternative interpretation, the courts could find someone liable for fraud on account of non-compliance with a contract, even if there was no breach of contract or it had not been declared null and void or invalid under the civil law. The effect was that the charges formulated under Article 159.4, read in conjunction with Articles 159 and 158, did not distinguish fraudulent conduct in the performance of contractual obligations between commercial entities from inherently lawful conduct."

In the present case, the courts established non-compliance with contractual obligations, but did not clarify what conduct had constituted such non-compliance, or indeed which contractual obligations had not been complied with. On the face of the documents, there were no allegations that GPA had failed to perform under the contracts. On the contrary, the services rendered by GPA corresponded to those set out in the contracts. Moreover, the transactions set out in the contacts have actually been executed by all counterparties. As for the use of subcontractors, as a general rule it is open to freight forwarders to subcontract their services (Article 805 of the Civil Code), and there was no suggestion before the domestic courts that the parties had agreed otherwise. Moreover, GPA ’ s clients did not object to third parties providing the services, which was seemingly a common practice in the sector (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 24 above). As a matter of fact, there was no dispute between the parties about the execution of the agreements in question prior to the fraud case."

Likewise, the courts ’ findings of deception and/or abuse of trust on the part of the second applicant appear to have resulted from an extrapolation of the presumption of trust derived from Article 159. According to the courts ’ interpretation, the second applicant was under an obligation to advise clients of cheaper alternatives to GPA ’ s services, and to offer them the same rates as those charged by the subcontractors. That obligation, however, was not based on the terms of the agreements, or on legal provisions governing confidence, trust and the duty of care in commercial transactions between companies."

The Court further notes that the interpretation of Article 159.4 in the light of Article 159 adopted by the courts in the present case required them to establish the presence of another essential element of fraud, in particular “motives of personal gain” by the defendants. However, some “motives of personal gain” may be identifiable in every commercial activity, unless clear criteria exist to distinguish it from the lawful objective of a limited liability company, such as GPA, which is defined as a commercial entity whose main purpose is making a profit (Article 50 of the Civil Code). By all accounts, GPA was set up for profit-making purposes and the applicants thus pursued the same goal as any other founder of a commercial entity. The domestic courts did not refer to a method for identifying a distinctively criminal “motive of personal gain” in what was otherwise a lawful commercial pursuit in relation to MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok."

In the light of the foregoing, the Court does not rule out the possibility that measures taken by the legislature, the administrative authorities or the courts after the final sentence has been imposed or while the sentence is being served may result in the redefinition or modification of the scope of the “penalty” imposed by the trial court. When that happens, the Court considers that the measures concerned should fall within the scope of the prohibition of the retroactive application of penalties enshrined in Article 7 § 1 in fine of the Convention. Otherwise, States would be free – by amending the law or reinterpreting the established regulations, for example – to adopt measures which retroactively redefined the scope of the penalty imposed, to the convicted person’s detriment, when the latter could not have imagined such a development at the time when the offence was committed or the sentence was imposed. In such conditions Article 7 § 1 would be deprived of any useful effect for convicted persons, the scope of whose sentences was changed ex post facto to their disadvantage. The Court points out that such changes must be distinguished from changes made to the manner of execution of the sentence, which do not fall within the scope of Article 7 § 1 in fine."

While the Court accepts that the Supreme Court did not retroactively apply Law no. 7/2003 amending the Criminal Code of 1995, it is clear from the reasoning given by the Supreme Court that its aim was the same as that of the above-mentioned law, namely to guarantee the full and effective execution of the maximum legal term of imprisonment by people serving several long sentences (see paragraph 33 above). In this connection, while the Court accepts that the States are free to determine their own criminal policy, for example by increasing the penalties applicable to criminal offences (see Achour, cited above, § 44), they must comply with the requirements of Article 7 in doing so ( Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 75, ECHR 2013).

It added that under Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 a prisoner who had served two days of his sentence was irrevocably considered to have served three days.

                "39. In judgment no. 197/2006 of 28 February 2006 the Supreme Court set a precedent known as the “Parot doctrine”. The case concerned a terrorist member of ETA (H. Parot) who had been convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973. The plenary Criminal Division of the Supreme Court ruled that the remissions of sentence granted to prisoners were henceforth to be applied to each of the sentences imposed and not to the maximum term of thirty years provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The court’s ruling was based in particular on a literal interpretation of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 according to which that maximum term of imprisonment was not to be treated as a new sentence distinct from those imposed, or a distinct sentence resulting from those imposed, but rather as the maximum term a convicted person should spend in prison. This reasoning made a distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena ); the former referred to the sentences imposed taken individually, to which remissions of sentence should be applied, while the latter referred to the maximum term of imprisonment to be served. The Supreme Court also used a teleological argument. The relevant parts of its reasoning read as follows:",
                "“... the joint interpretation of rules one and two of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 leads us to consider that the thirty-year limit does not become a new sentence, distinct from those successively imposed on the convict, or another sentence resulting from all the previous ones, but is the maximum term of imprisonment [ máximo de cumplimiento ] a prisoner should serve in prison. The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are: (a) first, a literal analysis of the relevant provisions leads us to conclude that the Criminal Code by no means considers the maximum term of thirty years to amount to a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply, for the simple reason that it says no such thing; (b) on the contrary, the sentence [ pena ] and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served [ condena ] are two different things; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the ‘term to be served’ [ condena ], and fixes the different lengths of that maximum ‘term to be served’ [ condena ] in relation to the ‘sentences’ imposed. According to the first rule, that maximum is arrived at in one of two ways: the different sentences are served in descending order of severity until one of the two limits set by the system is attained (three times the length of the heaviest sentence imposed or, in any event, no more than thirty years); (c) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the Code, since after having served the successive sentences as mentioned, the prisoner will no longer have to discharge [i.e. serve] the remaining ones [in the prescribed order] once the sentences already served reach the maximum length, which may not exceed thirty years ...; (e) and from a teleological point of view, it would not be rational for the combination of sentences to reduce a long string of convictions to a single new sentence of thirty years, with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence would be treated, without any justification, in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences, as in the present case. Indeed, there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing one murder is punished in the same way as committing two hundred murders; (f) were application for a pardon to be made, it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served [ condena ], but rather to one, several or all of the different sentences imposed; in such a case it is for the sentencing court to decide, and not the judicial body responsible for setting the limit (the last one), which shows that the sentences are not combined into one. Besides, the first rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 explains how, in such a case, the sentences must be served successively ‘the convicted person going on to serve the next sentence when the previous one has been extinguished by pardon’; (g) lastly, from a procedural point of view section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act clearly states that it is a matter of setting the maximum limit of the sentences imposed (in the plural, in keeping with the wording of the law), ‘ fixing the maximum term to be served in respect of all the sentences ’ (the wording is very clear).",
                "Which is why the term ‘combination [ refundición ] of the sentences to be served [ condenas ]’ is very misleading and inappropriate. There is no merging of sentences into a single sentence, but the number of years an individual can be expected to serve in respect of multiple sentences is limited by law. This means that the prisoner serves the different sentences, with their respective specificities and with all the corresponding entitlements. That being so, the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 may be applied to the sentences successively served by the prisoner.",
                "The total term to be served [ condena ] is thus served in the following manner: the prisoner begins by serving the heaviest sentences imposed. The relevant adjustments [ beneficios ] and remissions are applied to each of the sentences the prisoner serves. When the first [sentence] has been completed, the prisoner begins to serve the next one, and so on until the limits provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 have been reached, at which point all of the sentences comprised in the total term to be served [ condena ] will have been extinguished.",
                "Take, for example, the case of an individual given three prison sentences: thirty years, fifteen years and ten years. The second rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... limits the maximum term to be served to three times the most serious sentence or thirty years’ imprisonment. In this case the actual term to be served would be thirty years. The prisoner would begin serving the successive sentences (the total term to be served), starting with the longest sentence (thirty years in this case). If he were granted a ten-year remission for whatever reason, he would have served that sentence after twenty years’ imprisonment, and the sentence would be extinguished; next, the prisoner would start to serve the next longest sentence (fifteen years). With five years’ remission that sentence will have been served after ten years. 20 + 10 = 30. [The prisoner] would not have to serve any other sentence, any remaining sentences ceasing to have effect, as provided for in the applicable Criminal Code, once this maximum term, which may not exceed thirty years, is attained. ”"

In the above-mentioned judgment the Supreme Court considered that there was no well-established case-law on the specific question of the interpretation of Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 in conjunction with Article 70.2. It referred to a single precedent, its judgment of 8 March 1994 in which it had considered that the maximum duration provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 amounted to “a new, independent sentence” (see paragraph 36 above). However, the Supreme Court departed from that interpretation, pointing out that that decision was an isolated one and could therefore not be relied on as a precedent in so far as it had never been applied in a consistent manner.",

The three dissenting judges appended an opinion stating that the sentences imposed successively were transformed or joined together into another sentence, similar in nature but different in so far as it combined the various sentences into one. That sentence, which they called “the sentence to be served”, was the one resulting from the application of the limit fixed in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, which effectively extinguished the sentences that went beyond that limit. This new “unit of punishment” was the term the prisoner had to serve, to which remission for work done in detention was to be applied. Remissions would therefore affect the sentences imposed, but only once the rules on the consecutive serving of sentences had been applied to them “for the purposes of their completion”. The dissenting judges also pointed out that for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, all Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court (agreements adopted by the plenary Criminal Division on 18 July 1996 and 12 February 1999), had agreed to the principle that reductions of sentence should be applied to the sentence resulting from the application of Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (the thirty-year limit). In application of that principle no fewer than sixteen people convicted of terrorism had recently had their sentences reduced for work done in detention although they had each been given prison sentences totalling over a hundred years."

This new interpretation to the convicted person’s detriment was based on a policy of full execution of sentences which was alien to the Criminal Code of 1973, could be a source of inequalities and was contrary to the settled case-law of the Supreme Court (judgments of 8 March 1994, 15 September 2005 and 14 October 2005).

It explained that remissions of sentence which had already been approved had to be taken into account by the trial court required to rule on the discharge ( liquidación ) of the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), and that remissions already accrued in application of the law could not subsequently be revoked to correct any errors or permit the application of a new interpretation. It added that where there was no appeal against a decision by a judge responsible for the execution of sentences, that decision became final and binding in conformity with the principle of legal certainty and the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled. It considered that the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not conditional under the relevant law, as demonstrated by the fact that prisoners who misbehaved or attempted to escape lost that right only in respect of future adjustments, not in respect of those already granted."

It considered that the new method of applying remissions of sentence as a result of the Supreme Court’s departure from its case-law in 2006 had challenged final judicial decisions concerning the interested parties. It noted that the Audiencia Nacional which had adopted the decisions in question had considered that the Criminal Code of 1973 (which provided for a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years) was more favourable to the persons concerned than the Criminal Code of 1995 (where the limit was twenty-five years) because they would have lost the right to remissions of sentence from the time the Criminal Code of 1995 entered into force had it been applied to them. Observing that the Audiencia Nacional had based its finding on the principle that the remissions of sentence provided for under the old Code should be deducted from the legal maximum term of imprisonment (namely thirty years), it held that final judicial decisions could not be altered by a new judicial decision applying another method. It concluded that there had been a violation of the right to effective judicial protection, and more specifically of the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled (the “intangibility” of final judicial decisions, or the principle of res judicata ). Concerning the right to liberty, it considered that, regard being had to the Criminal Code of 1973 and the method of applying remissions of sentence adopted in the judicial decisions cited above, the prisoners concerned had completed their sentences, which meant that their continued detention after the release date proposed by the prison authorities (in conformity with the formerly applicable rules) had no legal basis.

The Constitutional Court referred to the Court’s case-law establishing a distinction between measures constituting a “penalty” and those relating to the “execution” of a sentence for the purposes of Article 7 of the Convention ( Hogben v. the United Kingdom, no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 231; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Gurguchiani v.

                "52. In the parts of its judgment no. 39/2012 concerning the principle of legality, for example, the Constitutional Court stated:",
                "“3. ... It must first be observed that the question under examination does not fall within the scope of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution – namely the interpretation and application of criminal charges, the classification of the facts established in respect of the offences concerned and the application of the corresponding penalties ... – but rather concerns the execution of custodial sentences, that is to say the application of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, and the interpretation we are required to examine cannot lead to the serving of sentences heavier than those provided for in respect of the criminal offences concerned, or to imprisonment in excess of the legal limit. In a similar manner, contrary to what the prosecution have argued, the European Court of Human Rights also considers that, even when they have an impact on the right to liberty, measures concerning the execution of the sentence – rather than the sentence itself – do not fall within the scope of the principle of no punishment without law enshrined in Article 7 § 1 of the Convention provided that they do not result in the imposition of a penalty harsher than that provided for by law. In its judgment in the case of Grava v. Italy (§ 51) of 10 July 2003, the European Court of Human Rights reached this conclusion in a case concerning remission of sentence, citing mutatis mutandis Hogben v. the United Kingdom (no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 46, pp. 231, 242, relating to release on licence). More recently, in its judgment of 15 December 2009 in the case of Gurguchiani v. Spain (§ 31), the Court stated: ‘both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a ‘penalty’ and a measure that concerns the ‘execution’ or ‘enforcement’ of the ‘penalty’. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relate to a remission of sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the ‘penalty’ within the meaning of Article 7.’",
                "The court must also reject the complaint concerning the alleged violation of the principle of no punishment without law (Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution) as a result of the retroactive application of Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995 (in its initial wording and as amended by Organic Law no. 7/2003), authorising the sentencing judge or court to order that ‘decisions concerning adjustments of sentence, day-release permits, pre-release classification and the calculation of the time remaining to be served prior to release on licence should take into account all of the sentences imposed’ in certain situations where sentences were grouped together (Article 78 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The law obliges the courts to take into account all the sentences in cases where particularly heavy multiple sentences were imposed. There are certain exceptions to this obligation, however (Article 78 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code currently in force). That said, the impugned decisions and the Supreme Court decision cited in them did not involve any retroactive application of that rule (which in any event is not applicable to remissions of sentence for work done in detention, as the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with such remissions). They simply applied the provisions that were in force at the time the offences of which the applicant was convicted were committed (Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), but with a new interpretation which, although based on the method of calculation expressly provided for in Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995, was possible, they explained, in view of the wording of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. That being so, if one follows the reasoning of the judicial bodies and the applicable rules, the appellant’s complaint lacks any factual basis as the principle of the non-retroactive application of a harsher criminal law enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution is breached only where a criminal law has been applied retroactively to acts committed before its entry into force ...”",
                "Concerning the right to liberty, the Constitutional Court held:",
                "“4. ... In our case-law remissions of sentence for work done in detention directly affect the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution, as the duration of the term of imprisonment depends inter alia on how they are applied, regard being had to Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... That provision states that ‘the prisoner shall be entitled, with the approval of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, to one day’s remission for every two days worked’, as calculated periodically by the judges responsible for the execution of sentences, based on proposals made by the prison authorities, said remission then being taken into account, for the purposes of the term of imprisonment to be served, by the sentencing court ...",
                "We have also held that remissions of sentence for work done in detention are in the spirit of Article 25 § 2 of the Constitution and the rehabilitational purpose of custodial sentences ... While it is true that Article 25 § 2 embodies no fundamental right protected by the amparo remedy, it does establish a penal and prison policy guideline for the legislature, as well as a principle regarding the interpretation of the rules on the imposition and execution of prison sentences, and both the guideline and the principle are enshrined in the Constitution ...",
                "Also, having noted that the right guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution authorises deprivation of liberty only ‘in the cases and in the manner prescribed by law’, we have found that it cannot be ruled out that the manner in which the sentence to be served is calculated may undermine that right in the event of failure to comply with the legal provisions relating to the consecutive or concurrent serving of different sentences that might have given rise to a reduction of the duration of the detention, where failure to apply the rules concerned leads to the unlawful extension of the detention and, consequently, of the deprivation of liberty ... In a similar vein the European Court of Human Rights has also found a violation of the right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5 of the Convention in a case where a prisoner served a longer sentence ‘than the sentence [he] should have served under the domestic law, taking into account the remission to which he was entitled. The additional time spent in prison accordingly amounted to unlawful detention within the meaning of the Convention’ ( Grava v. Italy, ECHR, 10 July 2003, § 45).”",

                "“8. However, we cannot limit ourselves to the mere finding of a violation [of Article 24 § 1 of the Constitution] arrived at above. We must also consider the consequences of that violation in terms of the right to liberty (Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution).",
                "Bearing in mind the binding nature of the order of 28 May 1997 adopted by the court responsible for the execution of sentences (whose role it was to determine how the sentence should be served and when it should end) and the legal situation created by the aforesaid decision in respect of the calculation of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the sentence was served for years as prescribed in the order in question: application of the former Criminal Code and the rules governing remissions of sentence for work done in detention, according to which the prisoner was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days worked, and deduction of the resulting remission, as periods of sentence discharged, from the maximum actual term of thirty years to be served following the combination of the sentences. That was confirmed by unequivocal acts by the prison authorities, who drew up charts showing provisional lengths of sentence taking into account remission for work done in detention, approved periodically by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences further to proposals by the prison authorities, and in particular one chart of 25 January 2006 which served as a basis for the proposal to release the prisoner on 29 March 2006, submitted to the judge by the prison governor.",
                "It follows that, under the legislation in force at the time of the offence, and taking into account the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as calculated according to the firm and binding criteria established by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, the appellant had already discharged the sentence he was given. That being so, and although the appellant was deprived of his liberty in a lawful manner, his deprivation of liberty fell outside the cases provided for by law once he had finished serving his sentence in the conditions outlined above, as the legal basis for his continuing detention had ceased to exist. It follows that the additional time the appellant served in prison amounted to unlawful deprivation of liberty in breach of the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution (see Grava v. Italy, ECHR 10 July 2003, §§ 44 and 45).",

In the dissenting opinion she appended to judgment no. 40/2012, Judge A. Asua Batarrita stated that the fact that the new interpretation of the rule for calculating the term of imprisonment to be served had been applied while the sentence was already under way shed doubt on an established legal situation and distorted projections based on the consistent interpretation of the applicable rules. She described the arrangements for remissions of sentence introduced by the Criminal Code of 1973 and the distinction traditionally made between the “nominal duration” and the “actual duration” of the sentence, which the courts took into account when fixing sentences. She pointed out that remissions of sentence for work done in detention differed from other measures entailing adjustment of sentences, such as release on licence, and that the granting of such remissions was not left to the discretion of the courts, which were not bound by criteria such as the prisoner’s good conduct or how dangerous he or she was considered to be. The judge concluded that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were mandatory by law. She stated that, under the Criminal Code of 1973, the principle of legality should apply not only to offences but also to the punitive consequences of their commission, that is to say the nominal limit of the prison sentences and their actual limit after deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. Noting that the limits set under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the remissions of sentence for work done in detention, had effectively reduced the maximum nominal sentence (thirty years) to a shorter actual term of imprisonment (twenty years), except in the event of misconduct or attempted escape, she expressed the view that the “Parot doctrine” had established an artificial distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term of imprisonment to be served” ( condena ) that had no basis in the Criminal Code, and had subjected the application of the thirty-year limit to a new condition – not provided for by Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 – according to which, during that period, the sentence was to be served “in a prison”, thereby preventing the application of the rules on remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In her view that was tantamount to imposing a nominal maximum term of forty-five years (that is, thirty years’ actual imprisonment plus fifteen years corresponding to work done in detention).",

In view of all these considerations she concluded that the interpretation by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 2006 had not been foreseeable and that there had been a violation of Article 25 § 1 (principle of legality), Article 17 § 1 (right to liberty) and Article 24 § 1 (right to effective judicial protection) of the Constitution."

He specified that this requirement should apply to the real and effective duration of the deprivation of liberty. Having noted that the legislation interpreted by the Supreme Court – the Criminal Code of 1973 – was no longer in force in 2006 and could therefore be brought into play only if it worked in the convicted person’s favour, he concluded that a sudden, unforeseeable departure from the case-law was incompatible with the right to liberty.

As a result of this change of approach the thirty-year term fixed by the decision of 30 November 2000, of which she had been notified the same day, had ceased to be treated as a new, independent and/or final sentence and the various sentences imposed on her between 1988 and 2000 (totalling over 3,000 years’ imprisonment) in eight trials had, in a manner of speaking, been restored.

In the applicant’s submission, the Criminal Code of 1973 was ambiguous in that it did not specify whether the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment was a new, independent sentence, whether the individual sentences continued to exist once they had been combined together, and to which sentence the remissions of sentence for work done should be applied. Judgment no. 197/2006 had not clarified the question of sentencing as the Supreme Court had not expressly set aside its order of 25 May 1990 according to which the combining of sentences provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 was the means of determining the sentence.",

The present case should be distinguished from cases concerning discretionary measures of early release or measures that did not result in a redefinition of the penalty (the applicant referred to Hogben, cited above, Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996; Grava, cited above; and Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005).

Five of the judgments by which the applicant had been convicted, as well as the decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, had expressly informed the applicant that, in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code, the total duration of the prison sentence she would have to serve was thirty years. They also pointed out that on 15 February 2001, the date of the Audiencia Nacional ’s decision setting 27 June 2017 as the date on which the applicant would have finished serving her sentence, the applicant had already accrued over four years’ remission of sentence for work done in detention.

The sole purpose of combining and placing an upper limit on the sentences had been to fix the duration of the actual term to be served as a result of all the sentences imposed in the different sets of proceedings. Besides, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 made it just as clear that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were to be applied to the “sentence imposed”, in other words to each of the sentences imposed until the maximum term had been reached."

Furthermore, that practice had no basis in the case-law of the Supreme Court in the absence of any established principle as to the manner of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. The sole judgment delivered on this issue by the Supreme Court in 1994 did not suffice to set an authoritative precedent under Spanish law. The Supreme Court’s case-law in the matter had not been settled until its Criminal Division had adopted judgment no. 197/2006. What is more, the Government argued, that case-law had been endorsed by the full Constitutional Court in several judgments delivered on 29 March 2012, containing numerous references to the Court’s case-law concerning the distinction between a “penalty” and its “execution”."

Remissions of sentence continued to be applied, but to each of the sentences individually, until the maximum term had been reached. Only in the case of the most serious crimes, such as those committed by the applicant, would the thirty-year limit be reached before the remissions of sentence granted for work done in detention had significantly reduced the sentences imposed. Similarly, the Chamber had mistakenly considered that the Supreme Court had retroactively applied the policy behind the legislative reforms of 1995 and 2003. It was plain to see that the reforms in question made no mention of the means of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the Criminal Code of 1995 having done away with them.

In Kafkaris, the Court had acknowledged that a prison-law reform which was applied retroactively, excluding prisoners serving life sentences from earning remissions of sentence for work done in detention, concerned the execution of the sentence as opposed to the “penalty” imposed (§ 151). In the present case the Government submitted that there had been no change in prison law. The only effect of Supreme Court judgment no. 197/2006 concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention had been to prevent the date of the applicant’s release being brought forward nine years, not to increase the penalty imposed on her."

The disputed measure concerned remissions of sentence or “early release”, not the maximum term that could be served in respect of the sentences imposed, which had not changed. Remissions of sentence for work done in detention did not pursue the same aims as the penalty as such, but were measures relating to its execution in so far as they allowed prisoners to be released before all their sentences had been served, provided that they demonstrated a willingness to return to the social mainstream through work or other paid activities. That being so, remissions of sentence for work done in detention could not be likened to measures imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”; instead, they were measures relating to the prisoner’s conduct while serving the sentence. In any event there was no question of any “severity” as they always benefited the prisoner concerned by bringing forward the date of release."

As remissions of sentence for work done in detention were purely a prison matter, the Supreme Court could not be criticised for having departed from previous practice with regard to the application of remissions of sentence, as the change had had no effect on the rights enshrined in Article 7. The Court had never held that the foreseeability requirement extended to the exact length of the sentence to be served taking into account sentence adjustments, remissions, pardons or any other factors affecting the execution of the sentence.

It argued that where changes to the law or the interpretation of the law affected a sentence or remission of sentence in such a way as to seriously alter the sentence in a way that was not foreseeable at the time when it was initially imposed, to the detriment of the convicted person and his or her Convention rights, those changes, by their very nature, concerned the substance of the sentence and not the procedure or arrangements for executing it, and accordingly fell within the scope of the prohibition of retroactivity. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that certain legal provisions classified at domestic level as rules governing criminal procedure or the execution of sentences had serious, unforeseeable effects detrimental to individual rights, and were by nature comparable or equivalent to a criminal law or a penalty with retroactive effect.

The Court observes that the parties’ submissions mainly concern the calculation of the total term of imprisonment the applicant should serve in accordance with the rules concerning the maximum term of imprisonment in respect of combined sentences, on the one hand, and the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973, on the other. The Court notes in this connection that, by a decision adopted on 30 November 2000 on the basis of section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act and Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, the Audiencia Nacional fixed the maximum term of imprisonment the applicant should serve in respect of all her prison sentences at thirty years (see paragraph 14 above). It further notes that, after having deducted from that thirty-year maximum term the remissions of sentence granted to the applicant for work done in detention, on 24 April 2008 the Murcia Prison authorities proposed 2 July 2008 to the Audiencia Nacional as the date for the applicant’s final release (see paragraph 16 above). On 19 May 2008 the Audiencia Nacional asked the prison authorities to change the proposed date and calculate a new date for the applicant’s release based on the new approach – the so-called “Parot doctrine” – adopted by the Supreme Court in judgment no. 197/2006 of 28 February 2006, according to which any applicable adjustments and remissions of sentence should be applied successively to each individual sentence until such time as the prisoner had finished serving the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment (see paragraphs 17, 18 and 39-42 above). Lastly, the Court observes that in application of this new case-law the Audiencia Nacional fixed the date of the applicant’s final release at 27 June 2017 (see paragraph 20 above).",

It is true that when the applicant committed the offences, Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 referred to a limit of thirty years’ imprisonment as the maximum term to be served ( condena ) in the event of multiple sentences (see paragraph 24 above). There thus seems to have been a distinction between the concept of the “term to be served” ( condena ) and the individual sentences ( penas ) actually pronounced or imposed in the various judgments convicting the applicant. At the same time, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973, on remission of sentence for work done, established that in discharging the “sentence imposed” the detainee was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days’ work done (see paragraph 24 above). However, that Article contained no specific guidance on how to apply remissions of sentence when multiple sentences were combined as provided for under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code and a maximum total term of imprisonment was fixed, as in the applicant’s case, where sentences totalling 3,000 years’ imprisonment were reduced to thirty years in application of that provision. The Court observes that it was not until Article 78 of the new Criminal Code of 1995 was introduced that the law expressly stated, with regard to the application of sentence adjustments, that in exceptional cases the total duration of the sentences imposed could be taken into account, rather than the maximum term provided for by law (see paragraph 32 above)."

                "98. The Court must also consider the case-law and practice regarding the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973. It notes that, as the Government have acknowledged, prior to the Supreme Court’s judgment no. 197/2006, when a person was given several prison sentences and it was decided to combine them and fix a maximum term to be served, the prison authorities and the Spanish courts applied the remissions of sentence for work done in detention to the maximum term to be served under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The prison and judicial authorities thus took into account the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment when applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In a judgment of 8 March 1994 (its first ruling on this question – see paragraph 36 above), the Supreme Court referred to the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment as a “new, independent sentence” to which the possibilities of adjustment provided for by law, such as release on licence and remission of sentence, should be applied. The Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court, took the same approach when comparing the sentences to be served respectively under the Criminal Code of 1995 and the previous Code, taking into account any remissions of sentence already granted under the previous Code, in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law (see paragraphs 37, 41 and 48 above). Lastly, until the Supreme Court’s judgment no. 197/2006 this approach was applied to numerous prisoners convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973, whose remissions for work done in detention were deducted from the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 41 above)."

Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that in spite of the ambiguity of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973 and the fact that the Supreme Court did not set about clarifying them until 1994, it was clearly the practice of the Spanish prison and judicial authorities to treat the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), that is to say the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, as a new, independent sentence to which certain adjustments, such as remissions of sentence for work done in detention, should be applied."

That being so, while she was serving her prison sentence – and in particular after the Audiencia Nacional decided on 30 November 2000 to combine her sentences and fix a maximum term of imprisonment – the applicant had every reason to believe that the penalty imposed was the thirty-year maximum term, from which any remissions of sentence for work done in detention would be deducted. Indeed, in its last judgment convicting the applicant, on 8 May 2000, delivered before the decision to combine the sentences was taken, the Audiencia Nacional took into account the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the same Code, in determining which Criminal Code – the one in force at the material time or the Criminal Code of 1995 – was the more favourable to the applicant (see paragraph 11 above). In these circumstances, contrary to what the Government have suggested, the fact that the applicant did not challenge the decision of the Audiencia Nacional of 15 February 2001 fixing the date on which she would have finished serving her sentence ( liquidación de condena ) at 27 June 2017 is not decisive, as that decision did not take into account the remissions of sentence already earned and was therefore unrelated to the question of how remissions of sentence should be applied."

The Court further notes that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were expressly provided for by statutory law (Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), and not by regulations (compare Kafkaris, cited above). Moreover, it was in the same Code that the sentences were prescribed and the remissions of sentence were provided for. The Court also notes that such remissions of sentence gave rise to substantial reductions of the term to be served – up to a third of the total sentence – unlike release on licence, which simply provided for improved or more lenient conditions of execution of the sentence (see, for example, Hogben and Uttley, both cited above; see also the dissenting opinion of Judge A. Asua Batarrita appended to judgment no. 40/2012 of the Constitutional Court, paragraph 53 above). After deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention periodically approved by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( Juez de Vigilancia Penitenciaria ), the sentence was fully and finally discharged on the date of release approved by the sentencing court. Furthermore, unlike other measures that affected the execution of the sentence, the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not subject to the discretion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences: the latter’s task was to fix the remissions of sentence by simply applying the law, on the basis of proposals made by the prison authorities, without considering such criteria as how dangerous the prisoner was considered to be, or his or her prospects of reintegration (see paragraph 53 above; compare Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, §§ 98-99, ECHR 2012, and Macedo da Costa v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 26619/07, 5 June 2012). It should be noted in this connection that Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 provided for the automatic reduction of the term of imprisonment for work done in detention, except in two specific cases: when the prisoner escaped or attempted to escape, and when the prisoner misbehaved (which, according to Article 65 of the 1956 Prison Regulations, meant committing two or more serious or very serious breaches of discipline; see paragraph 26 above). Even in these two cases, remissions of sentence already allowed by the judge could not be taken away retroactively, as days of remission of sentence already granted were deemed to have been served and formed part of the prisoner’s legally acquired rights (see paragraphs 26 and 45 above). The present case should be distinguished in this respect from Kafkaris, where the five years’ remission of sentence granted to life prisoners at the beginning of their incarceration was conditional on their good conduct (see Kafkaris, cited above, §§ 16 and 65)."

The Court also considers it significant that, although the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with remissions of sentence for work done in detention for people convicted in the future, its transitional provisions authorised prisoners convicted under the old Criminal Code of 1973 – like the applicant – to continue to enjoy the benefits of the scheme if it was to their advantage (see paragraph 30 above). Law no. 7/2003, on the other hand, introduced harsher conditions of release on licence, even for prisoners convicted before its entry into force (see paragraph 34 above). The Court infers from this that in opting, as a transitional measure, to maintain the effects of the rules concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention and for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law, the Spanish legislature considered those rules to be part of substantive criminal law, that is to say of the provisions which affected the actual fixing of the sentence, not just its execution."

Relying on the “Parot doctrine” established in judgment no. 197/2006, given by the Supreme Court on 28 February 2006 – well after the offences had been committed, the sentences combined and a maximum term of imprisonment fixed – the Audiencia Nacional moved the date back to 27 June 2017 (see paragraph 20 above). The Court notes that in judgment no. 197/2006, the Supreme Court departed from the interpretation it had adopted in a previous judgment of 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The majority of the Supreme Court considered that the new rule by which remissions of sentence for work done in detention were to be applied to each of the individual sentences – rather than to the thirty-year maximum term as previously – was more in conformity with the actual wording of the provisions of the 1973 Criminal Code, which distinguished between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena )."

For example, in its decision applying the Supreme Court’s “Parot doctrine”, the Audiencia Nacional did not change the quantum of the remissions of sentence granted to the applicant for work done in detention. The decision did not concern whether she deserved the remissions, for example in view of her conduct or circumstances relating to the execution of her sentence.

In other words, the applicant was initially sentenced to a number of lengthy terms of imprisonment, which were combined and limited to an effective term of thirty years, on which the remissions of sentence to which she was meant to be entitled had no effect whatsoever.

That being so, it remains to be determined whether the new interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973, long after the offences were committed and the applicant convicted – and even after the decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – was reasonably foreseeable for the applicant, that is to say whether it could be considered to reflect a perceptible line of case-law development (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, § 43, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, § 41, both cited above). To establish that, the Court must examine whether the applicant could have foreseen at the time of her conviction, and also when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – if need be, after taking appropriate legal advice – that the penalty imposed might turn into thirty years of actual imprisonment, with no reduction for the remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973.",

The Court observes in this connection that the only relevant precedent cited in that judgment was a judgment of 8 March 1994 in which the Supreme Court had taken the opposite approach, namely that the maximum prison term of thirty years was a “new, independent sentence” to which all the remissions of sentence provided for by law were to be applied (see paragraph 36 above). In the Court’s view, the fact that a single judgment does not serve as an authority under Spanish law (see paragraph 40 above) cannot be decisive. What is more, as the dissenting judges observed in the judgment of 28 February 2006, an agreement adopted by the plenary Supreme Court on 18 July 1996 had established that remissions of sentence granted under the Criminal Code of 1973 were to be taken into account when comparing the sentences to be served under the new and the old Criminal Codes respectively (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above). Following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, the Spanish courts were required to use this criterion, on a case-by-case basis, to determine which Criminal Code was the more lenient, taking into account the effects on sentencing of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention."

In addition, as indicated above (see paragraph 102), the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code of 1995 were intended to maintain the effects of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention set in place by the Criminal Code of 1973 in respect of people convicted under that Code – like the applicant – precisely so as to comply with the rules prohibiting retroactive application of the more stringent criminal law.

That “law” – in the substantive sense in which the term is used in the Convention, which includes unwritten law or case-law – had been applied consistently by the prison and judicial authorities for many years, until the “Parot doctrine” set a new course.

In this connection, while the Court accepts that the States are free to determine their own criminal policy, for example by increasing the penalties applicable to criminal offences (see Achour, cited above, § 44), they must comply with the requirements of Article 7 in doing so ( Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 75, ECHR 2013).

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the two (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Kafkaris, cited above, § 117; and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 88). However, with the passage of time the link between the initial conviction and the extension of the deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40). The causal link required under sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release, or to redetain a person, was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court, or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. Where that was the case a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (see Weeks, cited above, § 49, and Grosskopf v. Germany, no. 24478/03, § 44, 21 October 2010)."
            ],
            [
                "125. It is well established in the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 that all deprivation of liberty must not only be based on one of the exceptions listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) but must also be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 116, and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90). The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III; M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90; and Oshurko v. Ukraine, no. 33108/05, § 98, 8 September 2011). Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the domestic law define clearly the conditions for detention (see Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, § 120, 23 February 2012)."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that although Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention does not guarantee, in itself, a prisoner’s right to early release, be it conditional or final (see Kalan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 73561/01, 2 October 2001, and Çelikkaya v. Turkey (dec.), no. 34026/03, 1 June 2010), the situation may differ when the competent authorities, having no discretionary power, are obliged to apply such a measure to any individual who meets the conditions of entitlement laid down by law (see Grava, cited above, § 43; Pilla v. Italy, no. 64088/00, § 41, 2 March 2006; and Şahin Karataş v. Turkey, no. 16110/03, § 37, 17 June 2008).",

The Court observes first of all that as the applicant rightly pointed out, the distinction made for the purposes of Article 7 of the Convention between the “penalty” and the “execution” of the penalty is not decisive in connection with Article 5 § 1 (a). Measures relating to the execution of a sentence or to its adjustment can affect the right to liberty protected by Article 5 § 1, as the actual duration of deprivation of liberty depends on their application, among other things (see, for example, Grava, cited above, §§ 45 and 51, and, concerning the transfer of prisoners between States, Szabó v. Sweden (dec.), no. 28578/03, ECHR 2006-VIII). While Article 7 applies to the “penalty” as imposed by the sentencing court, Article 5 applies to the resulting detention."

In the present case the Court has no doubt that the applicant was convicted by a competent court in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention. Indeed, the applicant did not dispute that her detention was legal until 2 July 2008, the date initially proposed by the prison authorities for her final release. The Court must therefore establish whether the applicant’s continued detention after that date was “lawful” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court notes that in eight different sets of proceedings the Audiencia Nacional found the applicant guilty of various offences linked to terrorist attacks. In application of the Criminal Code in force at the time when the offences were committed, the applicant was given prison sentences totalling over 3,000 years (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In most of those judgments, as well as in its decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, the Audiencia Nacional indicated that the applicant was to serve a maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The Court notes that the applicant’s detention has not yet attained that maximum term. There is clearly a causal link between the applicant’s convictions and her continuing detention after 2 July 2008, which resulted respectively from the guilty verdicts and the maximum thirty-year term of imprisonment fixed on 30 November 2000 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris, § 120)."

            [
                "130. However, the Court must examine whether the “law” authorising the applicant’s continuing detention beyond 2 July 2008 was sufficiently foreseeable in its application. Compliance with the foreseeability requirement must be examined with regard to the “law” in force at the time of the initial conviction and throughout the subsequent period of detention. In the light of the considerations that led it to find a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, the Court considers that at the time when the applicant was convicted, when she worked in detention and when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, she could not have foreseen to a reasonable degree that the method used to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention would change as a result of a departure from case-law by the Supreme Court in 2006, and that the new approach would be applied to her."

[The Court of Appeal stated] that the Republic of Latvia, which had been occupied by the USSR, had not been able to take a decision [to that end] earlier. By referring to the principle of the non-applicability of statutory limitation, the Court of Appeal complied with the obligations arising under the international treaties and held the persons guilty of committing the offences concerned criminally liable irrespective of the date they were perpetrated.",

                "There is no basis to the argument ... that ... the Declaration by the Supreme Council of 4 May 1990 on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia and the Declaration by Parliament of 22 August 1996 on the Occupation of Latvia were mere political pronouncements which the court was precluded from using as a basis for its judgment and which could not be given binding force retrospectively.",

                "In its judgment, [delivered after] assessing the evidence examined at the hearing, [the Court of Appeal] found that, in his capacity as a combatant, V. Kononov organised, commanded and led a Partisan military operation intent on taking reprisals through the massacre of the civilian population of the village of Mazie Bati and the pillage and destruction of the villagers ’ farms. That being so, the Court of Appeal rightly found that the acts of individual members of his group ... could not be seen as [mere] excesses on the part of those concerned.",
                "In accordance with the criminal-law principles governing the responsibility of organised groups, members [of a group] are accomplices to the offence, independently of the role they play in its commission.",
                "This principle of responsibility of the members of an organised group is recognised in the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for Nuremberg, which lays down that leaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices participating in the execution of a common plan are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in the execution of that plan.",
                "Consequently, the argument that the Court of Appeal had used an ‘ objective responsibility ’ test to find, in the absence of any evidence, V. Kononov guilty of acts perpetrated by members of the special group of Partisans he led, without examining his subjective attitude to the consequences, is unfounded. ...”",

In this respect, the offence could be defined in written and unwritten, domestic or international law and Article 7 did not outlaw gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation so long as the resultant development was consistent with the essence of the offence.

In any event, any such Partisan tribunal judgment would have been unlawful as it would have been delivered in absentia in violation of even the basic tenets of a fair trial. The respondent Government had submitted to the Chamber letters dated February 2008 from the Prosecutor General ’ s Office (about the existence of the Partisan tribunal, the role of Mazie Bati and its villagers in the German defence and why arms had been issued to the villagers) and resubmitted these to the Grand Chamber."

During that Soviet occupation, Latvia was prevented from exercising its sovereign powers, including its international obligations. Apart from the resultant fear of the local population of the Red Partisans, it was a distortion for the applicant to suggest that the events of 27 May 1944 in Mazie Bati were a civil war incident as opposed to part of the international armed conflict opposing the Axis powers and, inter alia, the USSR."

In any event, even if they had lost that status and were to be considered “combatants”, nothing allowed the summary execution and murder of any person hors de combat unless a fair trial had taken place (and there was no proof of this) wherein it was established that they were indeed implicated in a criminal offence. Moreover, these were not lawful acts of “lawful belligerent reprisals” since, inter alia, such actions had been prohibited against prisoners of war since the 1929 Geneva Convention and, as regards civilians, it was never suggested that the villagers committed war crimes themselves."

His conviction was also objectively foreseeable given, inter alia, the declarations of certain States during the Second World War and the international and national prosecutions during and immediately after that war, in which processes the Soviet authorities had much involvement. That he was a Soviet war hero for years thereafter was not relevant: the key point was whether the acts could have been reasonably foreseen in 1944 as amounting to war crimes and not that his later fortuitous political situation would have excluded his prosecution.

He nevertheless submitted new documents (from the 1940s and from the Latvian State archives) to the Grand Chamber which he considered demonstrated a number of points: a map of the German defence posts including Mazie Bati; that the Nazi administration prohibited “civilians” carrying arms and, since they gave arms to the villagers of Mazie Bati, that the village was clearly taking part in military operations and was a focal point of the German defence; that the deceased villagers (notably members of the families of Bernards Šķirmants, Ambrozs Buļs and Meikuls Krupniks) had at some point joined the aizsargi (Latvian National Guard), and that the aizsargi regularly participated in anti-Semitic and Partisan killings in Latvia.

On 27 May 1944 he was a combatant defending his own State ’ s territory against Germany and other USSR citizens who were actively collaborating with Germany (relying on the judgment of the Latgale Regional Court). Since the USSR was not an occupying power, the applicant could not be a perpetrator of a war crime. He considered historically inaccurate the positions of the respondent and Lithuanian Governments which equate the lawful incorporation of Latvia in 1940 with the German occupation of 1941.

Contrary to paragraph 118 of the Chamber judgment, the Lithuanian Government considered that this issue had to be taken into account when examining notably the legal status of the belligerent forces in the Baltic States at the time. Indeed, the Court had already recognised that all three Baltic States had lost their independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ( the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 and its secret Protocol, the Treaty on Borders and Friendly Relations of 1939 and its secret Protocol, as well as the third Nazi-Soviet secret Protocol of 10 January 1941): the Pact was an undisputed historical fact, an illegal agreement to commit aggression against, inter alia, the Baltic States and resulted in their illegal occupation by Soviet forces. Indeed, the Soviet invasion of the Baltic States in June 1940 was an act of aggression within the meaning of the London Convention on the Definition of Aggression of 1933 and the Convention between Lithuania and the USSR on the Definition of Aggression of 1933. The involuntary consent of the Baltic States faced with Soviet aggression did not render this act of aggression lawful.",
                "The USSR itself had earlier treated the Anschluss as an international crime. In addition, in 1989 the USSR recognised ( in the Resolution on the Political and Juridical Appraisal of the Soviet-German Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939) its unlawful aggression against the Baltic States. Two conclusions followed: the USSR had not obtained any sovereign rights to the Baltic States so that under international law the Baltic States were never a legitimate part of the USSR and, additionally, the Baltic States continued to exist as international legal persons after the 1940 aggression by the USSR which aggression resulted in the illegal occupation of the Baltic States.",
                "Applying that to the facts in the present case, the Lithuanian Government argued that the Baltic States suffered aggression from the USSR and Nazi Germany: the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg characterised aggression in such a way as to treat both aggressors in the same manner. The Baltic peoples had no particular reason to feel sympathy with either and, indeed, had rational fears against both aggressors (in this respect, the Lithuanian Government take issue with paragraph 130 of the Chamber judgment given the well-established historical fact of USSR crimes in the Baltic States) so that a degree of collaboration with one aggressor in self-defence should not be treated differently. The peoples of the Baltic States could not be considered to have been Soviet citizens, as they retained under international law their Baltic nationality, but were rather inhabitants of an occupied State who sought safety from both occupying belligerent forces."

                "A number of instruments were relevant, in addition to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations, especially the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) and the 1977 Protocol Additional. It was a core principle of international humanitarian law in 1944 that there was a fundamental distinction between armed forces (belligerents) and the peaceful populations (civilians) and that the latter enjoyed immunity from military attack ( in that respect, they cited the Martens Clause; see paragraphs 86 to 87 above). The villagers did not meet the criteria defining “ combatants ” and were not therefore a lawful military target. Even if there had been some degree of collaboration by the villagers with the German forces, they had to retain civilian protection unless they met the “ combatant ” criteria: the opposite view would leave a population at the mercy of belligerent commanders who could arbitrarily decide that they were combatants and thus a legitimate military target. The killing of the women, unless they were taking part in hostilities as combatants, was not in any circumstances justified, as it would always have been contrary to the most elementary considerations and laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience. In that regard, the Government specifically took issue with paragraphs 141 and 142 the Chamber judgment."

                "185. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written and unwritten law and which implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability. As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; K. ‑ H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Jorgic v.

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws ( see X. v. Belgium, no. 268/57, Commission decision of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, p. 241). In any event, the Court further notes that the definition of war crimes included in Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was found to be declaratory of international laws and customs of war as understood in 1939 ( see paragraphs 118 above and 207 below)."

Article 7 § 1 requires the Court to examine whether there was a contemporaneous legal basis for the applicant ’ s conviction and, in particular, it must satisfy itself that the result reached by the relevant domestic courts (a conviction for war crimes pursuant to section 68-3 of the former Criminal Code) was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention, even if there were differences between the legal approach and reasoning of this Court and the relevant domestic decisions. To accord a lesser power of review to this Court would render Article 7 devoid of purpose. The Court will not therefore express an opinion on the different approaches of the lower domestic courts, notably that of the Latgale Regional Court of October 2003 on which the applicant heavily relies but which was quashed by the Criminal Affairs Division.

This could mean that the applicant lost “ combatant ” status [22] (thereby losing the right to attack [23] ) and wearing the enemy uniform during combat could of itself have amounted to an offence [24]. However, the domestic courts did not charge the applicant with a separate war crime on this basis. This factor does have some bearing, nonetheless, on other related war crimes of which he was accused (notably, treacherous killing and wounding, see paragraph 217 below). The Court has therefore proceeded on the basis that the applicant and his unit were “combatants”.

Earlier treaty provisions and declarations would indicate that by 1944 “civilians” were defined a contrario to the definition of “ combatants ” [29].

                "207. While the notion of war crimes can be traced back centuries, the mid-nineteenth century saw a period of solid codification of the acts constituting a war crime and for which an individual could be held criminally liable. The Lieber Code 1863 ( see paragraphs 63-77 above) outlined a multitude of offences against the laws and customs of war and prescribed punishments, and individual criminal responsibility was inherent in numerous of its Articles [33]. While it was an American Code, it was the first modern codification of the laws and customs of war and was influential in later codification conferences, notably in Brussels in 1874 ( see paragraph 79 above). The Oxford Manual 1880 forbade a multitude of acts as contrary to the laws and customs of war and explicitly provided for “offenders to be liable to punishment specified in the penal law”. These earlier codifications, and in particular the Draft Brussels Declaration 1874, in turn inspired the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. These latter instruments were the most influential of the earlier codifications and were, in 1907, declaratory of the laws and customs of war: they defined, inter alia, relevant key notions (combatants, levée en masse, hors de combat ), they listed detailed offences against the laws and customs of war and they provided a residual protection, through the Martens Clause, to inhabitants and belligerents for cases not covered by the specific provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. Responsibility therein was on States, which had to issue consistent instructions to their armed forces and pay compensation if their armed forces violated those rules.",
                "The impact on the civilian population of the First World War prompted provisions in the Treaties of Versailles and Sèvres on the responsibility, trial and punishment of alleged war criminals. The work of the International Commission in 1919 (after the First World War) and of the United Nations War Crimes Commission ( UNWCC ) (during the Second World War) made significant contributions to the principle of individual criminal liability in international law. “Geneva law” (notably the Conventions of 1864, 1906 and 1929; see paragraphs 53 to 62 above) protected the victims of war and provided safeguards for disabled armed forces personnel and persons not taking part in hostilities. Both the “Hague” and the “Geneva” branches of law were closely interrelated, the latter supplementing the former.",
                "The Charter of the IMT Nuremberg provided a non-exhaustive definition of war crimes for which individual criminal responsibility was retained and the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg opined that the humanitarian rules in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations were “recognised by all civilised nations and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war” by 1939 and that violations of those provisions constituted crimes for which individuals were punishable. There was agreement in contemporary doctrine that international law had already defined war crimes and required individuals to be prosecuted [34]. In consequence, the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was not ex post facto criminal legislation. The later Nuremberg Principles, drawn from the Charter and judgment of the IMT Nuremberg, reiterated the definition of war crimes set out in the Charter and that anyone committing a crime under international law was responsible and liable to punishment [35]."

International prosecution through the IMTs was the exception, the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg explicitly recognising the continuing role of the domestic courts. Accordingly, the international liability of the State based on treaties and conventions [36] did not preclude the customary responsibility of States to prosecute and punish individuals, via their criminal courts or military tribunals, for violations of the laws and customs of war. International and national law (the latter including transposition of international norms) served as a basis for domestic prosecutions and liability. In particular, where national law did not provide for the specific characteristics of a war crime, the domestic court could rely on international law as a basis for its reasoning, without infringing the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena sine lege [37]."

Lastly, during the Second World War there was a signalled intent from the outset to ensure the prosecution of war criminals [40] and, parallel to international prosecutions, the principle of domestic prosecutions of war criminals was maintained [41]. Accordingly, as well as the important IMT prosecutions, domestic trials took place during the Second World War (notably in the USSR) [42] and immediately after the Second World War [43], all concerning alleged war crimes committed during that war, certain trials being notable for their comprehensive treatment of relevant principles of the laws and customs of war, particularly as regards the necessity of a fair trial of combatants and civilians suspected of war crimes."

The Court has noted the detailed and conflicting submissions of the parties and the third parties on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR in 1940 and, consequently, on whether the acts on 27 May 1944 had any nexus to an international armed conflict and could therefore be considered as war crimes. The Grand Chamber considers (as did the Chamber, at paragraph 112 of its judgment) that it is not its role to pronounce on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR and, in any event in the present case, it is not necessary to do so. While in 1944 a nexus with an international armed conflict was required to prosecute acts as war crimes, that did not mean that only armed forces personnel or nationals of a belligerent State could be so accused. The relevant nexus was a direct connection between the alleged crime and the international armed conflict so that the alleged crime had to be an act in furtherance of war objectives [44]. The domestic courts found that the operation on 27 May 1944 was mounted given the suspicion that certain villagers had cooperated with the German military administration so that it is evident that the impugned events had a direct connection to the USSR/German international armed conflict and were ostensibly carried out in furtherance of the Soviet war objectives."

The notion of criminal responsibility for the acts of subordinates is drawn from two long-established customary rules: a combatant, in the first place, must be commanded by a superior and, secondly, must obey the laws and customs of war ( see paragraph 200 above) [45]. Individual criminal responsibility for the actions of subordinates was retained in certain trials prior to the Second World War [46], in codifying instruments and State declarations during and immediately after that war [47], and it was retained in (national and international) trials of crimes committed during the Second World War [48].

The Court observes the declaration of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel [52] case where the obligations to notify the existence of a minefield in territorial waters and to warn approaching warships were based, not on the relevant Hague Convention of 1907 (VIII) which applied in time of war, but on “general and well-recognised principles”, the first of which was described as “elementary considerations of humanity” which were even more exacting in peace than in war. In its later Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion [53], the ICJ referred to the two “ cardinal principles contained in the texts constituting the fabric of humanitarian law”. The first, referred to above, was the principle of distinction which aimed at the “protection of the civilian population and objects” and the second was the “obligation to avoid unnecessary suffering to combatants” [54]. Relying expressly on the Martens Clause, the ICJ noted that the Hague and Geneva Conventions had become “intransgressible principles of international customary law” as early as the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg. This was because, according to the ICJ, a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict were fundamental to “the respect of the human person” and to “elementary considerations of humanity”. Those principles, including the Martens Clause, constituted legal norms against which conduct in the context of war was to be measured by courts [55]."

It considers, having regard notably to Article 23 (c) of the Hague Regulations, that, even if the deceased villagers were considered combatants or civilians who had participated in hostilities, jus in bello in 1944 considered the circumstances of their murder and ill-treatment a war crime since those acts violated a fundamental rule of the laws and customs of war protecting an enemy rendered hors de combat. For this protection to apply, a person had to be wounded, disabled or unable for another reason to defend him/herself (including not carrying arms), a person was not required to have a particular legal status, and a formal surrender was not required [56]. As combatants, the villagers would also have been entitled to protection as prisoners of war under the control of the applicant and his unit and their subsequent ill-treatment and summary execution would have been contrary to the numerous rules and customs of war protecting prisoners of war (noted at paragraph 202 above). Accordingly, the ill-treatment, wounding and killing of the villagers constituted a war crime."

Secondly, the Court finds that the domestic courts reasonably relied on Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations to found a separate conviction as regards treacherous wounding and killing. The concepts of treachery and perfidy were closely linked at the relevant time so that the wounding or killing was considered treacherous if it was carried out while unlawfully inducing the enemy to believe they were not under threat of attack by, for example, making improper use of an enemy uniform. As noted at paragraphs 16 and 201 above, the applicant and his unit were indeed wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms during the operation in Mazie Bati. Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations clearly applies if the villagers are considered “combatants” and could also apply if they were considered “ civilians who had participated in hostilities ”. In this latter respect, the text of Article 23 (b) referred to killing or wounding treacherously “ individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army ”, which could have been interpreted as including any persons under some form of control of a hostile army including the civilian population of an occupied territory."

That women, especially pregnant women, should be the object of special protection during war was part of the laws and customs of war as early as the Lieber Code 1863 (Articles 19 and 37). It was further developed through “Geneva law ” on prisoners of war (women were considered especially vulnerable in this situation) [57]. The Court considers these expressions of “special protection”, understood in conjunction with the protection of the Martens Clause ( see paragraphs 86-87 and 215 above), sufficient to find that there was a plausible legal basis for convicting the applicant of a separate war crime as regards the burning to death of Mrs Krupniks.

                "The Court notes that the scope of the concept of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. Persons carrying on a professional activity must proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation and can be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails ( see Pessino v. France, no. 40403/02, § 33, 10 October 2006 )."

                "236. As to whether the qualification of the impugned acts as war crimes, based as it was on international law exclusively, could be considered to be sufficiently accessible and foreseeable to the applicant in 1944, the Court notes that it has previously found that the individual criminal responsibility of a private soldier (a border guard) was defined with sufficient accessibility and foreseeability by, inter alia, a requirement to comply with international fundamental human rights instruments, which instruments did not, of themselves, give rise to individual criminal responsibility and one of which had not been ratified by the relevant State at the material time ( see K.-H.W. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 92-105 ). The Court considered that even a private soldier could not show total, blind obedience to orders which flagrantly infringed not only domestic law, but internationally recognised human rights, in particular the right to life, a supreme value in the international hierarchy of human rights ( ibid., § 75)."

                "237. It is true that the 1926 Criminal Code did not contain a reference to the international laws and customs of war (as in K.-H.W. v. Germany ) and that those international laws and customs were not formally published in the USSR or in the Latvian SSR ( as in Korbely, cited above, §§ 74-75). However, this cannot be decisive. As is clear from the conclusions at paragraphs 213 and 227 above, international laws and customs of war in 1944 were sufficient, of themselves, to found individual criminal responsibility."

Moreover, the Court notes that in 1944 those laws constituted detailed lex specialis regulations fixing the parameters of criminal conduct in a time of war, primarily addressed to armed forces and, especially, commanders. The present applicant was a sergeant in the Soviet Army assigned to the reserve regiment of the Latvian Division: at the material time, he was a member of a commando unit and in command of a platoon whose primary activities were military sabotage and propaganda. Given his position as a commanding military officer, the Court is of the view that he could have been reasonably expected to take such special care in assessing the risks that the operation in Mazie Bati entailed. The Court considers that, having regard to the flagrantly unlawful nature of the ill-treatment and killing of the nine villagers in the established circumstances of the operation on 27 May 1944 ( see paragraphs 15-20 above), even the most cursory reflection by the applicant would have indicated that, at the very least, the impugned acts risked being counter to the laws and customs of war as understood at that time and, notably, risked constituting war crimes for which, as commander, he could be held individually and criminally accountable."
