Italy, no. 63154/00, § 78, 4 March 2008 ) or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing ( see Khudoyorov, cited above, § 129; and Liu v. Russia, no. 42086/05, § 79, 6 December 2007 ) – and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court ( ibid. ). A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a “gross and obvious irregularity” in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court's case-law (compare Liu, cited above, § 81; Garabayev v. Russia, no. 38 411/02, § 89, 7 June 2007, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts); and Marturana, cited above, § 79).

He had been working as a self-employed commercial agent for fifteen different firms in Germany ( whose names were listed in detail in the order ) since 1994.

                "48. The consequences of a court's finding in the course of judicial review proceedings that a detention order is flawed will depend on the nature of the defect found. Certain formal defects, in particular a failure to set out in sufficient detail in the order the facts establishing the grounds for strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest, as required by Article 114 § 2 no. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, will make the order defective in law ( rechtsfehlerhaft ), but not void ( unwirksam / nichtig ) (see, inter alia, Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 252/85, decision of 28 November 1985, Neue Zeitschrift für Strafrecht (NStZ) 1986, pp. 134-35; and Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, p. 318 ). Such defects may therefore be remedied by the appeal courts in the course of the judicial review proceedings by either quashing the defective order or replacing it with a fresh, duly reasoned order (compare, inter alia, Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 252/85, decision of 28 November 1985, NStZ 1986, pp. 134-35 with further references; Hamburg Court of Appeal, no. 2 Ws 124/92, decision of 23 March 1992, Monatsschrift für Deutsches Recht ( MDR ) 1992, p. 694; Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, pp. 318-319; and Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 196/00, decision of 26 September 2000, StV 2001, p. 118 ). A defective detention order thus remains a valid basis for detention until the defect is remedied. On the contrary, detention on the basis of a detention order which is void owing to a serious and obvious defect is unlawful (see paragraph 49)."

This is a consequence of the requirements of legal certainty and its corollary, the authority of court decisions, as well as of the overall structure of criminal proceedings with its system of legal remedies designed to correct defective decisions. Considering a court decision ... as legally irrelevant means that anyone may claim that it is null and void at any stage of the proceedings, even after it has become final ... In the case of decisions which can be challenged by an appeal, the statutory rules – formalities and time-limits – become inoperative if the decisions are deemed legally irrelevant. Such consequences, which run counter to the overall order of the law of criminal procedure, may be drawn from the defectiveness of a court decision only, if at all, where it would be unthinkable for the legal community to recognise (at least provisionally ) its validity. This will occur if the extent and gravity of the defect are such that the decision blatantly contradicts the spirit of the Code of Criminal Procedure and key principles of our legal order (see ... ). From the perspective of legal certainty, the assumption that a decision is null and void presupposes, in addition, that the serious defect is obvious” (see Federal Court of Justice, no. 1 BJs 80/78, decision of 16 October 1980, Neue Juristische Wochenschrift ( NJW ) 1981, p. 133 with further references; compare also Federal Court of Justice, no. 1 StR 874/83, decision of 24 January 1984, NStZ 1984, p. 279 )",

The court of appeal thus decides the merits of the case in the lower courts'stead ( see, for instance, Düsseldorf Court of Appeal, no. 4 Ws 222/02, decision of 18 June 2002, NJW 2002, p. 2964 )."

In certain limited circumstances, a case may exceptionally be remitted to the court of first instance if there has been a procedural defect which the court of appeal cannot properly remedy itself (see Brandenburg Court of Appeal, no. 2 Ws 50/96, decision of 17 April 1996, NStZ 1996, pp. 406 - 07; and Düsseldorf Court of Appeal, no. 4 Ws 222/02, decision of 18 June 2002, NJW 2002, pp. 2964 - 65 ). In particular, a court of appeal may remit the case to the district court instead of taking its own decision on the merits if a detention order does not comply with the duty to set out the grounds for suspecting the accused of an offence and if, in addition, the prosecution refused access to the case file. The explanation for this is that, in such cases, the defective reasoning effectively amounts to a breach of the duty to hear representations from the defendant. It was the district court which had jurisdiction to inform the accused for the first time of the grounds for suspecting him of an offence and to hear representations from him (see Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, pp. 318-19). The duty to expedite proceedings in which the suspect is in detention does not warrant a different conclusion as only a remittal of the case will enable him to avail himself effectively of his right to be heard ( see Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, p. 319)."

Italy, no. 63154/00, § 78, 4 March 2008 ) or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing ( see Khudoyorov, cited above, § 129; and Liu v. Russia, no. 42086/05, § 79, 6 December 2007 ) – and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court ( ibid. ). A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a “gross and obvious irregularity” in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court's case-law (compare Liu, cited above, § 81; Garabayev v. Russia, no. 38 411/02, § 89, 7 June 2007, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts); and Marturana, cited above, § 79).

                "76. The Court must moreover ascertain whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. On this last point, the Court stresses that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied (see Baranowski, cited above, §§ 51-52; Ječius, cited above, § 56; and Khudoyorov, cited above, § 125 ). In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be “lawful” and be effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions “in accordance with the law” and “prescribed by law” in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the “quality of the law”, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. “Quality of the law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III; and Nasrulloyev, cited above, § 71 ).",

                "77. No detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1, the notion of “arbitrariness” in this context extending beyond the lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. It is moreover clear from the case-law that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Saadi, cited above, § § 67- 68 )."
            ],
            [
                "78. One general principle established in the case-law is that detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities ( compare Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, § 59, Series A no. 111; and Saadi, cited above, § 69) or where the domestic authorities neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Benham, cited above, § 47; Liu, cited above, § 82; and Marturana, cited above, § 80)."

            [
                "79. Furthermore, in the context of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1, the reasoning of the decision ordering detention is a relevant factor in determining whether a person's detention must be considered as arbitrary. The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Stašaitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, § 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, § 70, 2 March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § 91, 1 March 2007 ). Conversely, it has found that an applicant's detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 131), unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant's detention (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 157)."

Moreover, the Court has acknowledged notably in the context of sub-paragraphs (c) and (e) of Article 5 § 1 that the speed with which the domestic courts replaced a detention order which had either expired or had been found to be defective is a further relevant element in assessing whether a person's detention must be considered arbitrary. Thus, the Court considered in the context of sub-paragraph (c) that a period of less than a month between the expiry of the initial detention order and the issuing of a fresh, reasoned detention order following a remittal of the case from the appeal court to a lower court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Minjat, cited above, §§ 46 and 48 ). In contrast, a period of more than a year following a remittal from a court of appeal to a court of lower instance, in which the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention on remand, combined with the lack of a time-limit for the lower court to re-examine his detention, was found to render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Khudoyorov, cited above, §§ 136-37 )."

In the context of sub - paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1, the Court considered that an interval of two weeks between the expiry of the earlier order of detention in a psychiatric hospital and the making of the succeeding renewal order could in no way be regarded as unreasonable or excessive so that this delay did not involve an arbitrary deprivation of liberty (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 49, Series A no. 33 ). In contrast, a delay of eighty-two days between the expiry of the initial order of detention in a psychiatric institution and its renewal and the lack of adequate safeguards to ensure that the applicant's detention would not be unreasonably delayed was found to be inconsistent with the purpose of Article 5 § 1 to protect individuals from arbitrary detention (see Erkalo, cited above, §§ 57-60 in respect of both sub - paragraphs (a) and (e) of Article 5 § 1 ).",

That order remained in force even after it was found to be flawed on formal grounds on 14 October 2002 as, in the judicial review proceedings, the Court of Appeal only quashed the decisions taken on 16 August 2002 and on 9 September 2002, not the detention order of 25 July 2002 (see paragraph 28 above). On 29 October 2002 the order of 25 July 2002 was replaced by a fresh detention order which contained more detailed reasoning; the applicant has not contested the compliance of that new order with Article 114 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."

In determining whether the detention order of 25 July 2002 suffered from a “gross and obvious irregularity” so as to be ex facie invalid, which would in turn render the applicant's detention based on that order unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, the Court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the assessment made by the domestic courts. It observes that according to the findings of the German courts, the order in question did not suffer from a serious and obvious defect which rendered it null and void. In fact, the German legal system, like the Convention system, distinguishes between detention orders which are null and void and those which remain valid until overturned by a higher court (see paragraphs 48-49 above). This distinction can equally be found in the legal systems of other Convention States (compare, for instance, the principles of English law laid down in Benham, cited above, §§ 24-26 and 43-46, the Netherlands'legal system as described in Erkalo, cited above, §§ 31-33 and 53-55, and the Swiss legal system explained in Minjat, cited above, §§ 21 and 42-44 ). In the present case, the Court of Appeal considered that the substantive conditions of the applicant's detention were met and that while the formal defects in the detention order of 25 July 2002 – namely the failure to describe in sufficient detail the facts and evidence on which the suspicion and the reasons for the defendant's detention on remand were based as required by Article 114 § 2 no. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – made the order defective in law, they were not so serious as to render it null and void."

The Court further notes that the District Court had jurisdiction to issue the detention order of 25 July 2002 against the applicant and heard representations from the applicant at a hearing before issuing the order and notifying him that it had done so. Furthermore, on the basis of the material before them, all the domestic courts agreed throughout the judicial review proceedings that the substantive conditions for the applicant's detention – a strong suspicion that he had evaded turnover, income and trade taxes and the danger of collusion or of his absconding – were met."

It is true that throughout his detention on the basis of the detention order of 25 July 2002 the applicant's counsel did not have access to the case file and that the Chamber found a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention on that account. However, contrary to the applicant's submission, neither that nor any other breach of Article 5 § 4 – even though that provision is part of domestic law – automatically entails a breach of Article 5 § 1. Paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 5 are separate provisions and the non-observance of the latter thus does not necessarily entail also the non-observance of the former (compare, for instance, Winterwerp, cited above, § 53, and Douiyeb, cited above, § 57 ). Even assuming that a refusal to grant counsel access to the case file in proceedings for the review of his or her client's detention could, when combined with other procedural flaws, lead to a detention order suffering from a “gross and obvious irregularity” within the meaning of the Court's case-law, the Court considers that this was not the position in the applicant's case. Even though the detention order of 25 July 2002 should have been based on more detailed facts according to the provisions of domestic law, the District Court still specified the charges against the applicant. In doing so, it listed the names of the firms that had paid the commission which the applicant had allegedly failed to declare to the tax authorities. It was moreover, clear that the suspicions against the applicant were based on the business records which had been seized at the applicant's home. Therefore, despite the fact that his counsel was not granted access to the case file, the applicant cannot in the circumstances complain that he was not informed at all or was unaware of the basis of the suspicions against him."

Firstly, he argued that the distinction made by the domestic courts between “defective” and “void” detention orders had no basis in the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Secondly, he stressed that the Court of Appeal's refusal to take the necessary decision on the merits itself contradicted the clear wording of Article 309 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."

In particular, detention orders which do not set out in sufficient detail the facts establishing the grounds for strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest have repeatedly been considered by the domestic courts to be “defective”, but not “void” (see paragraphs 48-49 above).

However, in their case-law, the courts of appeal introduced exceptions to that rule in certain limited circumstances. In particular, in cases – like the present one – in which they considered that the facts on which the suspicion of an offence was based should have been set out in more detail in the detention order and in which the prosecution had refused access to the case file, they decided that exceptionally it would be legitimate and would best serve the interests of justice to remit the case to the district court instead of taking their own decision on the merits (see paragraph 51 above)."

In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the remittal of his case to the court of first instance and his continuous detention at least up to that court's decision was sufficiently foreseeable for the applicant.

It was further clear that the suspicions against the applicant were based on documents that had been seized at the applicant's home so that the applicant was not wholly unaware of the evidence relied upon by the courts (see paragraph 88 above).

Despite the reservations it has expressed above ( see paragraph 9 3 ), the Court considers that remitting a case to a lower court is a recognised technique for establishing in detail the facts and for assessing the evidence relevant to a court's decision and cannot as such be considered arbitrary (compare also Minjat, cited above, §§ 47-48 ). In circumstances such as those obtaining in the present case, the benefits of remitting the case to a lower court may outweigh the inconvenience caused by the delay and may even serve to avoid unnecessary delays. Thus, firstly, remittal can enable the defects of the initial decision to be remedied while taking advantage of the lower court's full command of the case-file along with its more precise knowledge of the suspect's personal situation and of the state of the investigations against him. Moreover, in the case at hand the Court of Appeal did not confine itself to overturning the District Court's decision but instructed it how to avoid defective decisions in the future. This served the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the long run. Secondly, it was necessary to schedule a hearing attended by the applicant ( represented by counsel ), the Public Prosecutor's Office and a tax official in order to enable the applicant to be informed at least orally of the evidence against him and to make representations, and this required practical arrangements to be made. In these circumstances, the decision to remit the case may have actually avoided delays because, from the procedural perspective, it may well have proved quicker for the case to be remitted and for the District Court to decide whether a new detention order should be issued than for the Court of Appeal to decide that issue. Finally, under the domestic law, the District Court's fresh decision was subject to time constraints in that it had to be taken speedily (see paragraph 47 above) and it was that court which, following the remittal, had to arrange for a renewed hearing of the parties. Having regard to its case-law (see, in particular, that cited in paragraph 80 above, and, mutatis mutandis, in paragraph 81 ), the Court finds that in these circumstances, the time that elapsed between the Court of Appeal's finding that the detention order was defective and the issuing of a fresh detention order by the District Court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary either."

It considered that the applicant's complaint about the failure to grant his counsel access to the case file was only one aspect of his more comprehensive complaint about the lawfulness of his detention order. Additional proceedings for judicial review of the decision not to grant the applicant's counsel access to the case file under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not therefore have been capable of providing redress in respect of the alleged unlawfulness of the detention order, but only in respect of one aspect of the violation the applicant had complained of. Moreover, the Regional Court, which would have had jurisdiction to hear an application under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had in fact dealt with the applicant's complaint about the refusal of access to the file, and the applicant had also raised this issue before the Federal Constitutional Court in the course of the proceedings for judicial review of the detention order, which he had pursued to a conclusion. The Chamber concluded that in these circumstances, an additional application for judicial review under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not have been an effective remedy offering reasonable prospects of success which the applicant was required to exhaust (see paragraphs 83 - 84 of the Chamber judgment)."

The application should have been made expressly and in addition to his request for judicial review of the detention order, as a request under Article 147 § 5 was the only remedy under German law in respect of a prosecution refusal to grant the defence access to the case file.

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to afford redress for the violation complained of (compare Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 19, Series A no. 32; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 47, ECHR 1999-II; and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000-VII). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress directly in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 1 6 September 1996, § 68, Reports 1996-IV, and Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 156, ECHR 2003-VI). Thus, an applicant cannot be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end as the proceedings the applicant pursued to a conclusion and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (compare Iatridis, cited above, § 47, and Miailhe v. France ( no. 1), 25 February 1993, § 27, Series A no. 256-C)."

The Court notes that the applicant sought judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention order, inter alia, on the grounds that his counsel had not been granted access to the case file. In the course of the judicial review proceedings, the Mönchengladbach Regional Court – which, according to Article 161a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, would have had sole jurisdiction to decide any separate request under Article 147 § 5 of that Code – expressly addressed counsel's request for access to the file. In its decision of 9 September 2002, the Regional Court suggested that counsel for the applicant should be informed orally of the content of the case file in the first instance and could not claim unlimited access at that stage of the proceedings (see paragraph 20 above). The Federal Constitutional Court, which would also have had jurisdiction to review a dismissal by the Regional Court of any separate application expressly made by the applicant under Article 147 § 5, declined to consider the applicant's constitutional complaint about the detention order, in which he had raised the issue of lack of access to the file. In view of this, the Court considers that it can leave open the question whether a separate request under Article 147 § 5 could in general be considered an effective remedy capable of providing redress in cases in which a detainee contests the lawfulness of his detention in the first place. It finds that, in any event, in the particular circumstances of the case, in which the Regional Court expressly addressed and rejected the request for access to the case file in a decision that was upheld by the Federal Constitutional Court, any further, separate application under Article 147 § 5 to those same courts would have been bound to fail."

It had not been sufficient to provide the applicant's counsel with copies of four pages of the voluminous case file containing an overview by the Tax Fraud Office on the amount of the taxes the applicant was suspected of having evaded. Likewise, the authorities'proposal to give the applicant's counsel merely an oral account of the facts and of the evidence in the case file had failed to comply with the requirements of “equality of arms”. The fact that the Court of Appeal had later acknowledged that the applicant's procedural rights had been curtailed by the failure to grant his counsel access to the case file and that the domestic authorities had allowed his counsel to inspect the file after his conditional release were incapable of remedying in an effective manner the procedural shortcomings that had occurred in the earlier stages of the proceedings.

The Court notes that in the Peers case a cell of 7 square metres for two inmates was noted as a relevant aspect in finding a violation of Article 3, although in that case the space factor was coupled with an established lack of ventilation and lighting (see Peers, §§ 70–72, cited above ). In the Kalashnikov case the applicant had been confined to a space measuring less than 2 square metres. In that case the Court held that such a degree of overcrowding raised in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, §§ 96–97, ECHR 2002-VI). The Court reached a similar conclusion in the Labzov case, where the applicant was afforded less than 1 square. metre of personal space during his 35-day period of detention (see Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, §§ 41-49, 16 June 2005 ), and in the Mayzit case where the applicant was afforded less than 2 square metres during nine months of his detention (see Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005 ) as well as in Ananyev case where the applicants were afforded less than three square metres of personal space (see Ananyev and Others, § 148, cited above )."

The Court is aware of the necessity that such institutions, primarily designated for short periods of detentions, can have special freedom of movement regimes particularly concerning the remand prisoners, but that should not have any adverse effect on the prisoners who are serving longer sentences particularly where there is a restricted space in the sleeping facilities (see, mutatis mutandis, Lalić and Others v.

Whether the Court accepts the Government ’ s or the applicant ’ s account of the cell size and the number of inmates placed in the same cell as the applicant, the personal space allowed to each inmate falls below the standard required."

Italy, no. 22635/03, § 42, 16 July 2009). Such elements include, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, ventilation, access to natural light and air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements (see, for example, Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 123, 9 October 2008).

There were at least five beds to each cell, together with a dining table and chairs which did not leave much space for moving around. Furthermore, the sanitary facilities in the detention cells were not fully separated from the living area where the detainees were accommodated. It is not disputed between the parties that Zagreb Prison did not have dining facilities and that the food for all prisoners was served in cells. The Government also did not dispute that the dining table had been only one metre away from the open sanitary facilities which at the outset raises serious concerns about the hygiene and health conditions in the cell, regard being had in addition to the fact that the applicant was confined in such conditions for twenty-two hours a day."

The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions... Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v.

Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006)."

                "76. An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v. Russia, no. 12008/03, §§ 40-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, § 36, and Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, § 33, 19 June 2008)."

Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the “continuous situation” as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing."

Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion."

The complaint about an initial period of her detention followed by her release was submitted more than three years after it had ended and the complaint about her subsequent stay in the remand prison until her transfer to a correctional colony was introduced more than one year after the transfer.

The President of the Russian Federation had declared the “humanisation of justice” and expedited processing of cases to be the priorities for development of the judicial system. The Government explained that the Supreme Court had prepared the text of a ruling governing the application of preventive measures, including those of a custodial nature, in which it clarified that placement in custody should be applied only if a less restrictive preventive measure was not an available option (see paragraph 52 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office had directed the prosecutors to specify, in each application for a detention order, the concrete circumstances which made it impossible to use less restrictive preventive measures. The statistics, cited in paragraph 53 above, demonstrated that the prosecutors and courts had adopted a more nuanced approach to using custodial measures."

The measures included amending acts and regulations relating to the functioning of the penitentiary system, expansion of the network of remand prisons and construction of new cells, reducing the number of individuals transiting through remand prisons, and co-ordinated action of the police, prosecution and courts with a view to expediting the processing of cases.

In 2006, the Russian Government had approved a new expenditure programme for the period from 2007 to 2016 (see paragraph 54 above). In the first two years of the programme’s implementation more than 3,600 places had been created in remand prisons. By the end of 2008, the percentage of remand prisons that met Russian detention standards had risen to 34%. However, in 2009 the financing of the programme had been cut by 30% and a further cut by 45% was expected in 2010. From 1999 to 2009 the number of remand prisons had increased from 187 to 225, their design capacity from 112,500 to 151,000 places and the average cell space per inmate from 1.6 to 4.5 square metres. As at 1 July 2009 the remand prisons accommodated 133,200 detainees, representing 88.2% of their capacity.

In practice, however, a detainee who filed such a complaint while still being under the full control of the prison administration, ran the risk of retaliation on the part of the prison warders. Besides, where all detainees were held in substantially similar conditions, the individual situation of the complainant could only be improved at the expense of other inmates and to their detriment.

He would also be faced with a nearly insurmountable problem of collecting appropriate evidence: a majority of potential witnesses would be transferred to different facilities or correctional colonies located in remote regions. In addition, it had become an established judicial practice to deny the detained claimant the possibility of attending the hearing to state his position to the court in person (here they referred to the cases of Artyomov v.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

France, 20 February 1991, § 27, Series A no. 198, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, § 22, Series A no. 112). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement."

Accordingly, it has recognised that the rule of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 157-158, and Wasserman v.

If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred."

Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. In contrast to the cases concerning the length of judicial proceedings or non-enforcement of judgments, where the Court accepted in principle that a compensatory remedy alone might suffice (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 187, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 99, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...), the existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court’s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weakened the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements."

On that basis, it has rejected the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has held in particular that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant’s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant’s personal situation alone (see, among recent authorities, Kozhokar v. Russia, no. 33099/08, §§ 92-93, 16 December 2010; Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, §§ 43-44, 7 October 2010; Vladimir Krivonosov v.

Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to review those findings in the light of the situation in the Russian legal system both on the date of the submission of the individual applications in the instant case and on the date of the present judgment. In doing so, it will depart from its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, but rather make a global assessment of the remedies available in the domestic legal system that appear prima facie capable of offering either preventive or compensatory relief to the aggrieved individual.",

The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.

Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, § 84, with further references)."

Both the regional and the federal ombudsmen, however, lack the power to issue a legally binding decision that would be capable of bringing about an improvement in the complainant’s situation or would serve as a basis for obtaining compensation. Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). While their activities may usefully contribute to general improvement of conditions of detention, the ombudsmen remain unable, in view of their specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention. It follows that recourse to an ombudsman does not constitute an effective remedy.",

This means that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedy with examples from the case-law of the domestic courts. The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above)."

In the context of another structural problem in Russia, that of non-enforcement of final judicial decisions, the Court has already observed that the Russian courts’ capacity to order remedial action under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was essentially restricted to the issuing of a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any case evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to pay for its debts (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 103). In the instant case, as the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees. The prison governor of such a facility would obviously be in no position to enforce a large number of simultaneous judgments requiring him to remedy a violation of the detainees’ right to have at their disposal at least four metres of personal space."

The Court found that, while the possibility of obtaining compensation was not ruled out, the remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities (see, for instance, Roman Karasev v.

Inadequate conditions of detention do not appear in this list.

In the Aleksandr Makarov case, Mr Makarov’s detention in most aspects, including the lighting, food, medical assistance, sanitary conditions, etc., complied with domestic legal regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, §§ 98-100). The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules)."

                "116. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

Finally, the Court notes that even in cases where the Russian courts awarded compensation for conditions of detention that had been unsatisfactory in the light of the domestic legal requirements, the level of the compensation was unreasonably low in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for instance, Shilbergs, cited above, where the applicant was awarded RUB 1,500, that is less than 50 euros (EUR), for his detention in an extremely cold and humid cell, without adequate lighting, food or a personal sleeping place). In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79)."

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention.

Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Vlasov v.

As the Committee for the Prevention of Torture noted, not only did such contraptions have the effect of depriving prisoners of access to natural light and preventing fresh air from entering the accommodation but they also created conditions favourable to the spread of diseases and in particular tuberculosis (see paragraph 30 of the 11th General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above)."

As a result, they suffered both from inadequate access to natural light and air and from exposure to low winter temperatures, having no means to shield themselves from the cold freely penetrating into the cell from the outside (see Zakharkin, §§ 125-127, Gultyayeva, §§ 159-162, both cited above, and Starokadomskiy v.

Not only are hygiene and cleanliness integral parts of the respect that individuals owe to their bodies and to their neighbours with whom they share premises for long periods of time, they also constitute a condition and at the same time a necessity for the conservation of health. A truly humane environment is not possible without ready access to toilet facilities or the possibility of keeping one’s body clean (see point 15 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and point 19.4 of the European Prison Rules, cited in paragraphs 55 and 58 above, respectively)."

Indeed, the Court’s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v.

While the respondent State’s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski, cited above, § 198, and Xenides-Arestis v.

According to the Court’s case management database, there are at present approximately two hundred and fifty prima facie meritorious applications against Russia awaiting first examination which feature, as their primary grievance, a complaint about inadequate conditions of detention.

Nevertheless, the set of facts underlying these violations was substantially similar: detainees suffered inhuman and degrading treatment on account of an acute lack of personal space in their cells, a shortage of sleeping places, unjustified restrictions on access to natural light and air, and non-existent privacy when using the sanitary facilities. It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout Russia (compare Broniowski, § 189, and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above)."

In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities’ normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions – the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions – the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (§§ 204-210 of the report)."

In its first Interim Resolution concerning the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment, the Committee of Ministers noted that the problem of overcrowding plagued remand centres in fifty-seven out of eighty-nine Russian regions and that prompt action was necessary to remedy the problem and to align the sanitary conditions of detention with the requirements of the Convention (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2003)123, cited in paragraph 59 above). A second interim resolution adopted in 2010 concerned the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment and thirty-one further similar judgments that the Court had issued in the meantime (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited in paragraph 60 above). The resolution recalled that the existence of structural problems and the pressing need for comprehensive general measures had been stressed by the Committee of Ministers and acknowledged by the Russian authorities, and reiterated the need for an integrated approach to finding solutions to the problem of overcrowding in remand prisons, including in particular changes to the legal framework, practices and attitudes."

Its magnitude and urgency were acknowledged both in the Government’s submissions in the present case and in the documents and position papers adopted at national level, such as for instance the Federal Programme for Development of the Penitentiary of 5 September 2006 (cited in paragraph 54 above). The Programme expressly referred to Russia’s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme’s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016. However, less than one per cent of remand centres were expected to be compatible with the international standard of seven square metres per inmate by 2011 and only 11.4 per cent by 2016."

Notwithstanding a perceptible trend towards an improvement in material conditions of detention and a reduction in the number of prisoners awaiting trial, the urgency of the problem of overcrowding has not abated in recent years. The Court’s findings in the instant case and the continuing influx of new applications illustrate the gravity of the situation in some remand centres where inmates still do not have at their disposal an individual sleeping place, as was the case for Mr Ananyev, and highlight the absence of effective domestic remedies for either putting an end to an ongoing violation or obtaining compensation for a period of detention that has already ended. It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government’s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 134)."

Some of them – such as the insufficient number of remand prisons, their antiquity and poor state of repair, misallocation of resources, and a lack of transparency in prison management – may be traced back to the penitentiary system, whereas others – such as the excessive and often unjustified recourse to detention on remand, rather than alternative preventive measures, or a lack of efficient remedies to ensure that the conditions comply with the Russian legislation – have originated elsewhere.",

In the period from 2002 to 2006, a federal programme for reforming prisons permitted renovation and reconstruction of a number of remand centres and resulted in a tangible increase in the number of places and floor space per inmate. It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space.

The Court has reiterated in many of its judgments that, in view of both the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of liberty, remand in custody must be the exception rather than the norm and only a measure of last resort (see, among many others, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ X). The Committee for the Prevention of Torture considered that in the context of high incarceration rates, such as those persisting in Russia, “throwing increasing amounts of money at the prison estate will not offer a solution” (see paragraph 28 of the 11th General Report, CPT/Inf(2001)16), and has advocated active review of pre-trial custody policy. As recently as in 2010 the Committee of Ministers indicated that “the creation of new places of detention cannot in itself provide a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding and that this measure should be closely supported by others aimed at reducing the overall number of remand prisoners” (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, and also point I(2) of the Appendix to Recommendation R(99)22, cited in paragraph 57 above)."

A decreasing number of applications for initial detention orders may be interpreted as a consequence of the recent steps towards decriminalising certain non-violent offences and also as an indication of a more reserved approach on the part of investigative authorities to using custody as a preventive measure at the pre-trial stage.

Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor’s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody.

However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 § 3 in the Court’s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers’ assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 3. In addition to the Committee of Ministers’ conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v.

In addition, an operational capacity may be defined which is different from the maximum capacity and based on control, security and the proper operation of the regime, with a view to ensuring a smooth turnover of inmates and accommodating partial renovation work or other contingencies."

The law should also exhaustively define the situations in which the court may order the detainee’s temporary placement in an overcrowded facility.

The Court reached this conclusion following a careful examination of the situation obtaining in Russian law. The Court also noted the structural nature of this problem in the Russian legal system, finding that it does not currently allow the aggrieved individual either to put an end to an ongoing violation or to obtain adequate compensation for a period of detention that has already ended."

In view of the time elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al ., § 69, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, § 40, 23 September 2010). Less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would unacceptably weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see Finger, cited above, § 121, and McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 112, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., with further references). The Contracting States have consistently emphasised the need for effective domestic remedies, not least in the context of repetitive cases, which become vital for guaranteeing the long-term effectiveness of the Convention and containing the Court’s workload (see Recommendation Rec(2004)6 to member States on the improvement of domestic remedies, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences)."

In accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, the Court’s findings under this provision require clear and specific changes in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inadequate detention conditions and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level."

The title of such authority or its place within the administrative structures is not crucial as long as it is independent from the penitentiary system’s bodies, such as for instance Independent Monitoring Boards in the United Kingdom (formerly Boards of Visitors) or the Complaints Commission ( beklagcommissie ) in the Netherlands.

As the Court has observed above, the Pre-trial Detention Act and Prosecutors Act have vested broad investigative powers with supervising prosecutors and instituted a requirement on the prison authorities to report to them on the enforcement of their decisions. However, a complaint to a prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy in so far as the process of its examination does not provide for participation of the detainee. The Court considers that, for the procedure before the supervising prosecutor to be compliant with such requirements, the complainant must at least be provided with an opportunity to comment on factual submissions by the prison governor produced at the prosecutor’s request, to put questions and to make additional submissions to the prosecutor. The treatment of the complaint does not have to be public or call for the institution of any kind of oral proceedings, but there should be a legal obligation on the prosecutor to issue a decision on the complaint within a reasonably short time-limit."

It also welcomes the ruling by the Plenary Supreme Court of 10 February 2009, which explicitly characterised complaints about inadequate conditions of detention as being actionable Chapter 25 claims.

It is likewise unclear whether a Chapter 25 claim may be combined with an ordinary claim for damages under Articles 151 and 1064 of the Civil Code and be examined in the same set of proceedings. If the joining of these claims is impossible as a matter of law or judicial practice, this would impose an excessive burden on the claimant, who would be required first to litigate over his or her substantive grievance and then to bring the declaration of unlawfulness back to the same court with a view to instituting a new set of proceedings for compensation.

The Code of Civil Procedure does not specify the kind of remedial action a court may order and, as the Court has observed above, there is no case-law that could give indications as to the prevailing judicial practice. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population. Taking into account the pervasive and structural nature of the problem of overcrowding, consideration should be given to equipping the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem underlying an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of massive and concurrent violations of prisoners’ rights resulting from inadequate detention conditions in a given remand facility."

The recently enacted Compensation Act of 30 April 2010 is not applicable to Chapter 25 court orders as it only allows the creditor to claim monetary compensation in connection with the belated enforcement of a judgment debt against the State budgets (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), cited above). Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 104).

The introduction of the preventive remedy alone would clearly not be sufficient because a remedy designed to prevent the overcrowding and other violations of Article 3 from occurring would not be adequate to redress a situation in which the individual has already endured for some time inhuman or degrading treatment. The respondent Government must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for the violations that have already occurred. The Court would add that the introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Demopoulos and Others (dec.), cited above, § 69, and also, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.

The Court has previously accepted that in cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant’s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Finger, cited above, § 128; Morby v.

The proposal envisages that the time in pre-trial detention would be multiplied by certain standard reduction coefficients and the resulting period deducted from the duration of the custodial sentence. Whereas it is not for the Court to express an opinion on such an legislative issue, it considers it relevant to reiterate in this connection the requirements of an effective remedy, set out in paragraph 94 above, which may be useful for the Russian authorities in their implementation of the present judgment irrespective of the outcome of the above legislative amendment."

Without a specific explanation in the domestic courts’ judgments as to the extent to which the finding and acknowledgement of a violation of Article 3 entailed a reduction of the sentence, the mitigation of the sentence would not deprive, on its own, the aggrieved individual of his status as a victim of the violation (see Dzelili, cited above, § 85). This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment. Besides, it should be taken into account that an automatic reduction of sentence for convicted criminals on account of their previous stay in substandard detention facilities may adversely affect the public interest of criminal punishment (see Dimitrov and Hamanov v.

He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125)."

The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention.

The Court observes that the Government were unable to provide, apart from the description of the vans (see paragraph 54 above), any detailed information on the conditions in which the applicant was transported to and from the courthouse. Given the vans’ height (approximately 1.6 metres), detainees should have been kept there only in a seated position. However, given that the compartments in ZIL vans measured in total 11.28 sq. m and those in GAZ vans measured in total 8.93 sq. m (see paragraph 54 above), the Court does not find it conceivable that thirty-six persons in ZIL vans or twenty-five persons in GAZ vans were provided with adequate seating and space for transport under humane conditions. In view of these facts, the Court accepts as credible the applicant’s allegations concerning the overcrowding in the vans, the negative effects of which increased in proportion to the duration of the journeys to and from the courthouse (see paragraph 61 above)."

In a great number of cases, the Court has consistently found a violation of the applicants’ rights on account of a lack of sufficient personal space during their pre-trial detention. The present case is no exception in this respect. In view of the foregoing, the Court accepts that the applicant was detained in severely overcrowded cells for over a year.

Failure on the Government’s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation for such a failure may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant’s allegations (see Ahmet Özkan and Others v.

Their submissions were based on the statements of the remand prison officers made some four years after the events under consideration. Moreover, the Court cannot but note a certain discrepancy between this and other cases as far as the data submitted are concerned. For instance, in the case of Skachkov the Government submitted that between 11 February and 8 August 2003, cell no. 159 had accommodated twenty-two detainees (see Skachkov, cited above, § 18), while in the present case the national authorities affirmed that in the periods from 18 February to 23 April 2003 and from 25 April to 15 August 2003, the same cell had accommodated only thirteen inmates.

However, given that the compartments in ZIL vans measured in total 11.28 sq. m and those in GAZ vans measured in total 8.93 sq. m (see paragraph 54 above), the Court does not find it conceivable that thirty-six persons in ZIL vans or twenty-five persons in GAZ vans were provided with adequate seating and space for transport under humane conditions.

The Commission considered that the six-month time ‑ limit precluded it from expressing any opinion on whether the length of the applicant’s first period of detention was “reasonable”. The Court agreed with this approach. However, it added that the first period should nevertheless be “taken into account” when assessing the reasonableness of the second period.

In the event of his being convicted, this first period would normally be deducted from the term of imprisonment to which he would be sentenced (Section 55(a) of the Austrian Criminal Code); it would thus reduce the actual length of imprisonment which might be expected.

In the case of Kemmache v.

In circumstances where applicants have continued to be deprived of their liberty while the criminal proceedings were pending at the appeal stage, the Court has always regarded the multiple consecutive pre-trial detention periods as a whole and found that the six-month rule should start to run only from the end of the last period of pre-trial detention (see, among numerous authorities, Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, §§ 34-37, [16 January 2007]).",

It appears that the Court has also adhered to this approach in some cases where an applicant’s detention pending trial before a first-instance court was not continuous, without, however, setting out explicitly the reasons why it considered such periods cumulatively (see Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, § 34, Series A no. 207; Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 66, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts); and Mitev v. Bulgaria, no. 40063/98, § 102, 22 December 2004).",

In Neumeister the Court did not add up, or consider as a whole, two separate periods of the applicant’s pre-trial detention for the purposes of calculating its length. The Court noted that it could not examine whether or not the first period of the applicant’s pre ‑ trial detention was compatible with the Convention given that he had not lodged his application until after the six-month time-limit in respect of that period had expired. The Court merely noted that it would take that period into account in assessing the reasonableness of the applicant’s later detention as the first period would normally be deducted from the ensuing term of imprisonment should the applicant be found guilty and given a prison sentence (ibid.).",
                "83. In the instant case, as in the case of Neumeister, the applicant’s detention was broken up into several non-consecutive periods. He was released twice during the trial and awaited the determination of the criminal charges against him while at liberty. Significant periods of time elapsed between the periods of his detention. Even though the detention periods were eventually deducted from the term of the applicant’s imprisonment, this fact alone does not allow the Court to regard his detention as consecutive. To find otherwise would strip the six-month rule of its meaning.",
                "84. Accordingly, the Court finds that the part of the applicant’s complaint concerning the second and third periods of his pre-trial detention, which ended on 24 July 1999 and 24 January 2000 respectively, cannot in the circumstances be examined.”",

At the outset, the Court reiterates that the six-month rule, in reflecting the wish of the Contracting Parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after an indefinite lapse of time, serves the interests of legal certainty. It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000-I)."

Therefore, once at liberty, an applicant is obliged to bring any complaint which he or she may have concerning pre-trial detention within six months of the date of actual release. It follows that periods of pre-trial detention which end more than six months before an applicant lodges a complaint before the Court cannot be examined, having regard to the provisions of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. However, where such periods form part of the same set of criminal proceedings against an applicant, the Court, when assessing the overall reasonableness of detention for the purposes of Article 5 § 3, can take into consideration the fact that an applicant has previously spent time in custody pending trial."

The Court considers that the Neumeister approach faithfully respects the intention of the Contracting Parties vis-à-vis the six-month rule, whilst simultaneously permitting it, in the interests of justice, to have regard to prior periods of time spent in custody (in connection with the same criminal proceedings) in its assessment of the overall reasonableness of pre-trial detention. The Court adopts a similar line of reasoning in its assessment of complaints concerning the “reasonable time” requirement of Article 6. In certain cases, part of such a complaint may be inadmissible ratione temporis and the Court is precluded from examining a period which falls outside its competence. Nevertheless, when assessing a period which falls within its competence the Court may take into account the fact that proceedings had already been pending prior to ratification of the Convention by the respondent State concerned (see, among numerous authorities, Kudła, cited above, § 123)."

The Neumeister approach also provides the Court with the requisite degree of flexibility to deal with a variety of situations which might arise in the context of pre-trial detention. For instance, if an applicant is repeatedly taken into custody pending trial, albeit for relatively short periods of time, the Court will not be precluded from finding that, against the background of a number of previous periods of detention, the length of the final period – though brief in itself – may nevertheless be unreasonable."

If an application for pre-trial detention is made in circumstances where previous periods of such detention are the subject matter of a complaint before this Court, domestic courts may be more likely to pay particular attention to the time it is taking for the prosecuting authorities to bring an accused to trial. It is also more probable that, in such circumstances, they will ensure that detailed and careful scrutiny is carried out and that relevant and sufficient justification is advanced before granting any further orders permitting pre-trial detention.",

The existence and persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention. However, after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds are “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita, cited above, §§ 152 and 153). Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I). When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial (see Jablonski v.

On seven occasions either the applicant or his counsel failed to appear in court. In 2003, that is, during the third year of the trial, the applicant’s counsel asked for adjournments on three occasions in order to obtain the attendance of additional witnesses. Admittedly, it was in the applicant’s best interests to obtain that evidence in order to take full advantage of the resources afforded by national law to ensure his best possible defence in the criminal proceedings.

The Government also argued, with respect to conditions in the detention facility IZ-47/1, that the applicant had not exhausted the domestic remedies available to him.

The Court notes, as far as exhaustion of domestic remedies is concerned, that the applicant complained about the degrading conditions of his detention several times, both to the prosecutor ’ s office and the trial court, which was accepted by the Government. The Court therefore considers that the authorities were thereby made sufficiently aware of the applicant ’ s situation. It is true that he did not lodge separate complaints with the courts or prosecutor ’ s offices as suggested by the Government. However the Government did not demonstrate what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by such a measure, taking into account that the problems arising from the conditions of his detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not only concern his personal situation (see Kalashnikov v. Russia ( dec .), no. 47095/99, 18 September 2001, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 57, 1 June 2006 and Benediktov v. Russia, no. 106/02, §§ 29-30, 10 May 2007 ).

The Court reiterates that Article 35 § 1 of the Convention permits it to deal with a matter only if the application is lodged within six months of the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It also reiterates that in cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Koval v. Ukraine ( dec .), no. 65550/01, 30 March 2004). In the instant case, during the period of his detention the applicant was held in two detention facilities and was transferred to other facilities several times. Therefore, with respect to the Government objection that the application in respect of detention conditions in the Kingisepp police department had been submitted too late, the question to be resolved is whether the whole period of the applicant ’ s detention constitutes a “continuing situation”, and thus meets the six-month criterion."
            ],
            [
                "35. The Court reiterates that the concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII ). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation ( see Camberrow MM5 AD v. Bulgaria, ( dec .), no. 50357/99, 1 April 2004 ). Hence, the Court has previously refused to treat the time spent by applicants in different detention facilities as a continuing situation in cases where their complaints related to specific episodes, such as force - feeding (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine ( dec .), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003), failure to render medical assistance at different facilities (see Tarariyeva v. Russia ( dec .), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005) or complaints relating to different detention regimes (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia ( dec .), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The Court has also refused to take into account an applicant ’ s earlier periods of detention where his complaints mainly concerned the conditions of the most recent detention (see Khudoyorov v. Russia ( dec .), no. 6847/02, 22 February 2005). Further, where an applicant has been released between different periods of detention, the Court has limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006, and Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007 )."

It appears that throughout the whole period of his detention he was not released at any time and the detention conditions remained substantially identical; the applicant ’ s transfer from one facility to another did not in any way change his situation. His complaints do not relate to any specific event but concern the whole range of problems regarding the sanitary conditions, the temperature in the cells, overcrowding and so on, which he suffered during the entire period of his detention. It follows that the applicant ’ s detention in the Kingisepp police department and detention facility no. IZ/ 47 can be regarded as a continuous situation. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government ’ s objection."

A failure on a Government ’ s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well- foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations (see, among other authorities, Fadeyeva v.

Although in the present case there is no indication that there was an explicit intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, the Court finds that the fact that the applicant was obliged to live, sleep and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates for about two years was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him."

                "61. The Court observes that in the course of the sixty-five-hour transport from Sosnogorsk to Nizhniy Novgorod the applicant remained alone in the two-square-metre compartment. Every two hours he was checked upon and forced to change his position, thus being denied uninterrupted eight-hour sleep. The Court finds it particularly striking that those regular “checks” are prescribed by domestic legal regulations governing transport of detainees. The applicant ’ s sleeping conditions were further aggravated by the constant lighting in the cell. The resulting deprivation of sleep must have constituted a heavy physical and psychological burden on the applicant (see Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, § 85, 25 October 2007 )."

                "62. Furthermore, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant was provided with food during his transport as the Government failed to present any documents having evidentiary value (see paragraph 60 above). However, even proceeding on the assumption that the Government ’ s assertion is correct, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant was allegedly provided with a two-day food ration for the journey that lasted almost three days. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the clear insufficiency of food given to an applicant may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kadiķis v. Latvia (no. 2), no. 62393/00, § 55, 4 May 2006, and Stepuleac v. Moldova, no. 8207/06, § 55, 6 November 2007 ). Moreover, while in the present case it cannot be established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the ventilation, lighting and sanitary conditions on the train were unacceptable from the standpoint of Article 3, the Court nonetheless notes that the Government did not dispute that there was no window or other opening in the compartment giving access to natural light or ventilation. The conditions of the applicant ’ s transport thus could have been further exacerbated by that aspect."

                "63. The Court reiterates that the assessment of the minimum level of severity which a given form of treatment must attain if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162; and Kudła, cited above, § 91). The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kudła, cited above, § 92)."

Twice a day warders turned on a ventilation system. The cells were constantly lit by a bulb placed in a niche above the door. The walls were covered with so-called “ shuba ”, a sort of abrasive concrete lining, designed to prevent detainees from leaning on the walls or writing on them. Inmates were allowed to take a shower once a week for fifteen minutes. A central-heating system was installed in the building. However, there had been no hot water since 1996.

                "When the CPT first visited the Russian Federation in November 1998, overcrowding was identified as the most important and urgent challenge facing the prison system. At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years.",
                "The CPT welcomes the measures taken in recent years by the Russian authorities to address the problem of overcrowding, including instructions issued by the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, aimed at a more selective use of the preventive measure of remand in custody. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee ’ s delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2).",
                "125. As during previous visits, many prisoners expressed scepticism about the operation of the complaints procedure. In particular, the view was expressed that it was not possible to complain in a confidential manner to an outside authority. In fact, all complaints, regardless of the addressee, were registered by staff in a special book which also contained references to the nature of the complaint. At Colony No 8, the supervising prosecutor indicated that, during his inspections, he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private “because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony ’ s administration”.",

If necessary, the existing arrangements should be modified in order to guarantee that prisoners can make complaints to outside bodies on a truly confidential basis. ”",

The Court does not lose sight of the Government ’ s argument that certain aspects of the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention varied in the two facilities. However, it does not consider that differences in the measurements of the windows or availability of bedding are characteristics which allow distinctions to be made between the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention or the separation of his detention into two periods depending on the facility where he was detained."

The Government, relying on the extracts from the registration log drawn up in the Ukhta Town detention unit (see paragraph 15 above), the certificates issued by the director of facility no. IZ-7/2 and written statements by the warders of that facility (see paragraph 20 above), argued that the applicant had usually been detained with two or three other inmates in the first facility and either with three inmates in the smaller cell or with seven inmates in the bigger cells in the second facility."

Those submissions were corroborated by the extracts from the registration log recording names of detainees and their allocation to the cells in the ward. These extracts state that the applicant was usually held with two or three other detainees in ten-square-metre cells. Thus, the living area per inmate varied from 2.6 to 3.4 square metres. At the same time, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the applicant had his own “sleeping place” throughout his detention in the ward. The Government alleged that there were four sleeping places in the cells. However, the photos of the cell produced by the Government (see paragraph 15 above) show only two single-tier metal bunks. It follows that the number of detainees was greater than the number of available bunks and the detainees, including the applicant, had to share the sleeping facilities, taking turns to rest."

The Court considers it extraordinary that in December 2005, that is almost four years after the applicant ’ s detention in that facility had come to an end, the officials were able to recollect the exact number of inmates who had been detained together with the applicant. The Court observes that it was open to the Government to submit copies of registration logs showing names of inmates detained with the applicant. However, no such documents were presented. The Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to submit the extracts from the registration logs to support their allegations concerning the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention in the first detention facility, but failed to do so to corroborate their statements pertaining to the second detention facility."

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies which are available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

The Court has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, p. 1211, § 69, and Aksoy, cited above, p. 2276, §§ 53 - 54)."

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the Government, without providing any further explanation, suggested that a court could have been an effective remedy in the applicant ’ s case for his complaints about the poor conditions of his transport. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of a remedy concerning a complaint of inhuman and degrading treatment is whether the applicant could have raised that complaint before domestic courts in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article 3 of the Convention. The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. Ukraine, no. 65550/01, § 94, 19 October 2006 ). The Court notes that the Government did not explain whether a complaint to a court could have offered the aforementioned preventive or compensatory redress or both for allegations of the conditions of transport which had been contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The Government did not make reference to any legal norm on the possibility of lodging an action seeking damages for treatment already suffered as a result of the conditions of transport, or on the possibility of such an action being preventative of further sufferings.

His journey was divided into two parts with a provisional stop in Nizhniy Novgorod. The travel time from Sosnogorsk to Nizhniy Novgorod amounted to sixty-five hours.

The Court finds it particularly striking that those regular “checks” are prescribed by domestic legal regulations governing transport of detainees. The applicant ’ s sleeping conditions were further aggravated by the constant lighting in the cell. The resulting deprivation of sleep must have constituted a heavy physical and psychological burden on the applicant (see Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, § 85, 25 October 2007 )."

In the instant case the Russian authorities did not give any consideration to the first applicant ’ s requests referring to his mother ’ s serious illness and, after she died, they considered that they did not have sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements for him to attend the funeral. The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court ’ s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State ’ s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative ’ s funeral was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The question of using the park at Bolotnaya Square was not raised because the declared number of participants was 5,000, whereas over 20,000 people could be accommodated in the open area of the square and the embankment, and [the organisers] had known that in advance. It had been discussed with them how the cordon would be placed from Malyy Kamennyy bridge to the park at Bolotnaya Square, so the organisers knew about the cordon in advance. The placement of the cordon was indicated in the [security plan].

Gudkov he had conducted negotiations with the police ... an agreement had been reached that the cordon at the Malyy Kamennyy bridge would be moved back and the access to the park would be opened up, but at that point some young men in hoodies among the protesters began first to push the citizens onto the cordon provoking the [same] response; after that the cordon was broken, the [police] began the arrests and mass disorder ensued.",

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim ’ s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘ special features ’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44. However, the Court does not consider that it has to define in abstracto which ‘ special features ’ trigger the existence of a jurisdictional link in relation to the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2, since these features will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances of each case and may vary considerably from one case to the other.”"

Turkey, no. 23531/94, § 89, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Tekin v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, § 67, Reports 1998 ‑ IV) and the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v.

The Court notes that the first applicant ’ s allegations of abduction and ill-treatment concern both the negative and positive obligations of Russia and Ukraine under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. As regards the negative obligations, in so far as the first applicant may be understood as having alleged the involvement of the Russian authorities in his abduction and the cooperation or knowing acquiescence of the Ukrainian authorities, there is no evidence that the abductors acted on behalf of the Russian authorities, or that the Ukrainian authorities actively or passively participated in the abduction. The Court therefore sees no grounds to find either respondent State in breach of the substantive guarantees of these provisions."

It notes that the essential facts underlying the first applicant ’ s complaint of abduction were not contested by either of the respondent Governments. All parties agreed that on 19 October 2012 in the morning the first applicant was in Kyiv and that at about 9 p.m. on the same day he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border by car. It was also confirmed by the Ukrainian Government, and not contested by the Russian Government, that he had visited the HIAS office that morning and had then left for lunch, but had not returned to the office."

The Ukrainian authorities acknowledged, moreover, that at about 4 p.m. on the same day the HIAS legal officer had reported the first applicant ’ s suspected abduction to the Kyiv police and requested that it be investigated in criminal proceedings. Given that, according to the eyewitnesses, the first applicant was wrestled into a vehicle, this complaint suggested not only that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty but that there had been a risk of his ill ‑ treatment by the perpetrators. From the moment they received this report, the Ukrainian authorities ’ obligation to investigate the incident was engaged under both Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention."

However, they initially refused to open a criminal investigation after a superficial inquiry which ended with a decision of 7 December 2012 to dispense with criminal proceedings. The Ukrainian authorities have implicitly acknowledged that that inquiry did not constitute an effective investigation. In December 2014 they undertook to carry one out (see paragraph 163 above). However, in the absence of any report on the part of the respondent Government on the progress of those proceedings the Court cannot but conclude that the Ukrainian authorities have not complied with this obligation to date."

As regards the Russian authorities with which the first applicant lodged complaints shortly after his arrest in Moscow, the Russian Government stated that his allegations were unsubstantiated because the first applicant had not sustained any injuries which he could demonstrate as evidence. However, the Court does not consider the absence of injuries to be sufficient to dismiss a complaint of this kind. By presenting witness statements from the HIAS staff the applicant made a prima facie case of abduction, possibly associated with inhuman or degrading treatment during his transfer to Russia, which placed the Russian authorities under an obligation to investigate it. If they could not take any practical steps towards an inquiry for lack of territorial jurisdiction, it was their obligation to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian authorities (see Güzelyurtlu and Others, cited above, §§ 232- 33), but this has not been done. In any event, the order for the first applicant ’ s abduction was allegedly given in Russia, and it was incumbent on the Russian authorities to verify these allegations. Moreover, the first applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty and ill ‑ treatment had allegedly continued in Russian territory. The Court therefore cannot accept that the Russian authorities could not have taken any action within their competence."

As regards the intensity of the court hearing schedule, it had remained reasonable, taking account of the need to secure the applicant ’ s right to trial within a reasonable time.

The applicant alleged that he had been transferred back to the detention facility despite still being seriously ill and having difficulty walking. He had made multiple requests to the trial court to reduce the intensity of the hearing schedule and to change his preventive measure to house arrest to allow him to recover from illness, stress and fatigue.

While the applicant argued that the updated diagnosis of third-degree hypertension proved that the conditions of his detention and the lack of medical care had caused damage to his health, the Court considers this insufficient to find a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The medical files submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 102 - 106 above) show that he was regularly seen by various medical specialists and was receiving treatment for his various health disorders. He was twice placed in the prison hospital, in particular after a heart seizure, and coronary angiography was performed in order to diagnose his condition.

Russia, nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, § 110, 4 October 2016). The Court observes that, according to both parties, the hearings were conducted four days a week, from about 11 a.m. to about 5 p.m. However, this did not include the time the first applicant spent during the transfer between the detention facility and the court. During the trial he regularly complained about his early departures from the detention facility – as early as 6 a.m. – and late arrivals after the hearings, typically after 11 p.m., but sometimes after midnight, and asked the court to reduce the frequency of the hearings, to transfer him to another detention facility or to apply a non ‑ custodial preventive measure. The Government did not comment on the applicant ’ s submissions about his early pick-up and late drop-off times. It appears from the detention facility ’ s report that the drop-off time was 10.15 p.m., which means that the first applicant had seven hours and forty ‑ five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254 - 255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant ’ s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

Having regard to the circumstances of the second applicant ’ s house arrest as described in paragraph 44 above, the Court considers that subjecting him to this measure between 9 February 2013 and 24 July 2014, that is, for over one year and five months, constituted deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention."

                "214. The Court observes that the second applicant ’ s detention under house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking not to leave Moscow and to behave properly, in particular with reference to his participation in public events, seeing that, on at least one occasion, he had been given an administrative sanction for a breach of the procedure for holding public events. Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant ’ s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5 § 1 in this respect. Whether there were grounds which were “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify the house arrest is a question to be examined under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Buzadji, cited above, § 61)."

As noted above, the second applicant ’ s house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking to remain in Moscow and to display proper behaviour. Although the risks of his influencing witnesses, continuing criminal activity, destroying evidence and obstructing the course of the criminal proceedings were also listed among the grounds, the court did not indicate any specific facts showing the emergence of those risks. The gravity of the charges, the second applicant ’ s possession of a travel passport, his wife ’ s and children ’ s temporary residence in Ukraine and his connections were referred to in a general manner, and these circumstances had already existed at the time when the original preventive measure of an undertaking rather than detention was ordered. Therefore, they could not be considered relevant for replacing it with another preventive measure."

In finding the second applicant in breach of the undertaking the domestic court first noted his frequent absences from his home address and his trips to other regions and abroad, and concluded that there was a risk of his absconding. This finding was based solely on one report stating that a police officer had been unable to reach the applicant in order to summon him to receive the indictment on 26 October 2012. However, it appears from the parties ’ submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow ’ s city limits in breach of the undertaking. Accordingly, the risk of his absconding was not sufficiently demonstrated in the judicial decision imposing house arrest."

Secondly, in relation to the alleged breach of the undertaking to display proper behaviour, the court relied on information about the second applicant ’ s participation in at least three opposition rallies, one of which resulted in an administrative conviction for holding a public event not compliant with the procedure established by law; on that basis it established the existence of a risk of his reoffending. As found above, the second applicant ’ s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant ’ s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as “relevant” and “sufficient”. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court ’ s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant ’ s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk. Moreover, the courts systematically rejected the applicant ’ s offer of bail without stating reasons beyond a formulaic indication that this would not suffice as a preventive measure."

Secondly, the judge ’ s appointment had resulted in a strict deadline for completing the trial at first instance and giving judgment, and that could have motivated the judge to reject the applicants ’ requests to examine witnesses in order to be able to finish the case before taking up his new office. The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses. The judge had considered some of these applications an abuse of process and potentially punishable, and this had discouraged the defence counsel from raising important procedural points, including the judge ’ s lack of independence and impartiality."

In the present case, the Court has no grounds for finding that the appointment of Judge Z. to a superior court precluded him from continuing to hear the case under examination before the new appointment had taken effect.

This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 ).",

It observes that the first applicant and his lawyers made numerous detailed and specific complaints alleging that he could not concentrate on the hearing because of exhaustion and sleep deprivation. The courts, however, considered that the schedule was reasonable on the basis of the time the applicant spent in court. They did not take into consideration the time the first applicant spent being transferred, although they accepted the report from the detention facility indicating the drop-off time as 10.15 p.m., implying that this left him seven hours and forty-five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 103-11). The cumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant ’ s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers. While the Court accepts the domestic court ’ s reasons for expediting the proceedings, it considers that in this case insufficient consideration was given to the first applicant ’ s requests for a less intensive hearing schedule."

Whereas Article 8 does not guarantee an unconditional right to leave to attend a relative ’ s funeral, and even though a detainee by the very nature of his situation may be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see Lind, § 94, and Feldman, § 34, both cited above). The authorities can refuse an individual the right to attend the funeral of his parents only if there are compelling reasons for such refusal and if no alternative solution can be found (see Płoski v.

The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court ’ s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State ’ s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative ’ s funeral was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The Court has found that Article 11 of the Convention is applicable to the second applicant ’ s complaint about his prosecution and criminal conviction for organising mass disorder during the assembly at Bolotnaya Square (see paragraph 285 above). Accordingly, these measures constituted an interference with the exercise of the freedom of assembly (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, § 172). The Court will therefore examine whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society”, as required by Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

As to whether the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was lawful, the Court takes cognisance of his argument that the clashes which took place at Bolotnaya Square on 6 May 2012 could not have been characterised as “mass disorder” within the meaning of Article 212 of the Criminal Code. As in previous cases, the Court considers that the applicability of this provision was not entirely inconceivable and that it has no grounds to disagree with the domestic courts ’ assessment of the situation made within the margin of their judicial discretion (ibid., §§ 173-75). It therefore finds that the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “prescribed by law”. The Court also accepts that it pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights and freedoms of others, as argued by the Government."

Turning to the question whether the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes that he was sentenced to four years and four months ’ imprisonment for organising mass disorder at Bolotnaya Square, and that this sentence was served concurrently with the four-year prison term imposed on him in the same proceedings for having conspired to organise multiple acts of mass disorder."

As regards the events at Bolotnaya Square, his conviction was based on the finding that being one of the event organisers, he was responsible for the stand-off between the protesters and the police and that, moreover, the stand-off had been part of the plan to take the protest outside the allocated perimeter and to set up a long-term protest campsite in the park."

                "291. As stated in paragraph 279 above, the Court, having observed the parties ’ submissions in the present case, maintains its conclusion that the tensions at Bolotnaya Square arose because of the authorities ’ unannounced change of the venue layout in order to prevent illegal campsites from being set up in the park at Bolotnaya Square (see Frumkin, cited above, § 106). It also considers it sufficiently established that the tension escalated into clashes because of the law-enforcement officials ’ failure to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the dispute about the placement of the police cordon ( ibid., §§ 112-15 and 126). However, the judgment in respect of the second applicant attributed responsibility for the violence to the protesters, and to him personally as one of the organisers, without assessing to what extent the authorities had contributed to the deterioration of the assembly ’ s peaceful character."
            ],
            [
                "292. Furthermore, the Court finds that the second applicant ’ s conduct and his statements to the public remained peaceful at all stages. He demanded airtime on Russia ’ s main television channels, called for the presidential inauguration of Mr Putin to be cancelled and for new elections to be held and called on the assembly participants to stay at the meeting venue for an indefinite protest action. He may also have encouraged the setting-up of campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement. These calls, in particular for overstaying the allocated time-slot of the assembly and for setting up a campsite, were clearly illegal as they would have been in breach of the established rules on holding a public assembly."

                "293. However, none of the second applicant ’ s statements incited recourse to physical force or actions of a destructive nature. On the contrary, he repeatedly called on the participants to remain calm and peaceful. The fact that certain protesters may have committed violent acts does not affect the assessment of the second applicant ’ s conduct in the absence of evidence that they had been incited by him. The mere fact that the second applicant was one of the event organisers is not sufficient to hold him responsible for the conduct of the attendees (see Mesut Yıldız and Others v. Turkey, no. 8157/10, § 34, 18 July 2017 )."

                "294. Neither could the second applicant ’ s violent intentions be inferred from the circumstances underlying the related set of charges examined in the same set of proceedings, namely preparation of the organisation of acts of mass disorder (other than the one at Bolotnaya Square). In particular, no such intentions were apparent from the fundraising activities which he carried out before and after 6 May 2012 in order to finance opposition rallies, training sessions for activists and media campaigns. The recordings of negotiations examined at the trial and referred to in the judgment contained no reference to armed or other forceful methods of exerting political pressure on the authorities. In particular, the proposal to block railway lines made in the conversations recorded undercover and relied on by the domestic judgment was attributed to the first applicant, and in any event the extent of violence involved in that proposal was not assessed. The domestic judgments thus left open the question whether the “political instability” allegedly promoted by the second applicant carried an element of violence in the sense of riots or mass disorder, as opposed to advocating political change by peaceful means. The domestic courts therefore omitted a crucial element of the balancing exercise which is required by the proportionality principle when imposing sanctions for unlawful conduct at assemblies (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 142-44, and Gülcü v. Turkey, no. 17526/10, §§ 110 ‑ 17, 19 January 2016 )."

Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification (see Rai and Evans v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 26258/07 and 26255/07, 17 November 2009). A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty (see Akgöl and Göl v. Turkey, nos. 28495/06 and 28516/06, § 43, 17 May 2011, and Gün and Others, cited above, § 83 ).

In the present case, the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was not based on an assessment of the nature of his conduct, that is, whether his acts and intentions were violent or peaceful. In omitting to justify the criminal sanction by a specific reference to the violent nature of his conduct, the national authorities failed to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and thus to demonstrate that his criminal conviction for having organised mass disorder at Bolotnaya Square met a “pressing social need” (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 143 )."

The chilling effect of this sanction was further amplified by the fact that it targeted a well-known public figure, and by the large-scale proceedings in this case, which attracted widespread media coverage."

It does not seem that there exists any reported case ‑ law clarifying the exact purport of this provision and, in particular, how it interplayed with section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see, mutatis mutandis, Soini and Others v. Finland, no. 36404/97, §§ 55 in fine and 56, 17 January 2006). The Court further notes that in 2006 the Bulgarian Constitutional Court found that a provision whose wording was almost identical with that of section 33(1)(c) – the newly added section 132d(3) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act – was contrary to Articles 30 § 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above).

This is borne out by the wording of section 37(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraph 19 above).

                "43. It remains to be established whether the systematic interception of prisoners ’ correspondence envisaged by section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act was “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the Court observes that some measure of control over this correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment ( see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, § 98; and Campbell, cited above, p. 18, § 45). However, correspondence with lawyers, whether it concerns contemplated or pending proceedings or is of a general nature, is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § § 47 and 48 ). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner ’ s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as “ reasonable cause ” will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § 48)."

                "44. By contrast, section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act, as construed by the competent domestic authorities, calls for indiscriminate monitoring of the entirety of the prisoners ’ correspondence (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). It does not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners correspond. Nor does it, or the regulations for its application, lay down any rules – for instance, concerning time ‑ limits – governing the implementation of this monitoring. Moreover, the authorities are not bound to give any reasons in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Calogero Diana, cited above, p. 1775, § 32; Domenichini v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ V, p. 1799, § 32; Petra, cited above, p. 2854, § 37; and Niedbała v. Poland, no. 27915/95, § 81, 4 July 2000 ). Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court finds that the monitoring of the entirety of the applicant ’ s correspondence addressed to and coming from the outside world – including the letters to and from his lawyer – cannot be considered as corresponding to a pressing social need or proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Neither the competent domestic authorities, nor the Government have sought to explain why such all ‑ embracing monitoring was indispensable (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 21, 24 February 2005 ). On the contrary, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court voiced serious concerns in this regard (see paragraph 21 above)."

It does not seem that there exists any reported case ‑ law clarifying the exact purport of this provision and, in particular, how it interplayed with section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see, mutatis mutandis, Soini and Others v. Finland, no. 36404/97, §§ 55 in fine and 56, 17 January 2006). The Court further notes that in 2006 the Bulgarian Constitutional Court found that a provision whose wording was almost identical with that of section 33(1)(c) – the newly added section 132d(3) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act – was contrary to Articles 30 § 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above).

This is borne out by the wording of section 37(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraph 19 above). It can thus be said that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of “ the prevention of disorder or crime ” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2."

                "43. It remains to be established whether the systematic interception of prisoners ’ correspondence envisaged by section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act was “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the Court observes that some measure of control over this correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment ( see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, § 98; and Campbell, cited above, p. 18, § 45). However, correspondence with lawyers, whether it concerns contemplated or pending proceedings or is of a general nature, is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § § 47 and 48 ). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner ’ s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as “ reasonable cause ” will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused ( see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, § 48)."

                "44. By contrast, section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act, as construed by the competent domestic authorities, calls for indiscriminate monitoring of the entirety of the prisoners ’ correspondence (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). It does not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners correspond. Nor does it, or the regulations for its application, lay down any rules – for instance, concerning time ‑ limits – governing the implementation of this monitoring. Moreover, the authorities are not bound to give any reasons in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Calogero Diana, cited above, p. 1775, § 32; Domenichini v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ V, p. 1799, § 32; Petra, cited above, p. 2854, § 37; and Niedbała v. Poland, no. 27915/95, § 81, 4 July 2000 ). Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court finds that the monitoring of the entirety of the applicant ’ s correspondence addressed to and coming from the outside world – including the letters to and from his lawyer – cannot be considered as corresponding to a pressing social need or proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Neither the competent domestic authorities, nor the Government have sought to explain why such all ‑ embracing monitoring was indispensable (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 21, 24 February 2005 ). On the contrary, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court voiced serious concerns in this regard (see paragraph 21 above)."

                "51. The Court must thus establish whether the matter of which the applicant complains falls within the purview of Article 8. On this point, it first observes that while any detention which is lawful under Article 5 of the Convention entails by its nature a limitation on private and family life, it is an essential part of an inmate ’ s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47 095/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI (extracts); and Aliev v. Ukraine, no. 41220/98, § 187, 29 April 2003 ). The Court further notes that a couple who have lived together for many years constitute a “family” for the purposes of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention and are entitled to its protection notwithstanding the fact that their relationship exists outside marriage (see Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 4 1488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ). Finally, the Court observes that telephone conversations, whether they be made from a person ’ s home or from other premises, are covered by the notions of “ private life ” and “ correspondence ” within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ III, p. 1016, § 44 ). Seeing that the person with whom the applicant wished to converse by telephone, Ms S.P., had been his unmarried partner for a number of years and had had a child with him, the prohibition to contact her by telephone undoubtedly affected the enjoyment of his right to respect for his private and family life, and as such fell within the ambit of Article 8. It is also clear that this prohibition concerned the applicant ’ s right to respect for his “correspondence” within the meaning of paragraph 1 of that Article. Article 14 is therefore applicable."

Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 160, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... ). The Court must therefore determine whether the applicant – who had an established long-term de facto relationship with Ms S.P. (see paragraph 16 above) – was in an analogous situation with married prisoners as regards the possibility to contact their partners by telephone."

The Court is also mindful that marriage remains an institution which is widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who enter it and, indeed, is singled out for special treatment under Article 12 of the Convention (ibid.). However, it fails to see any difference between the situations of inmates who wish to have telephone conversations with their spouses and inmates who wish to have such conversations with their unmarried partners with whom – like the applicant – they have an established family life. It therefore concludes that their situations are substantially similar in this regard."

No such justification has been advanced in the instant case, either by the competent domestic authorities or by the Government in the proceedings before the Court. The obtaining situation was the result of the wording of section 37a(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act and its particularly strict application by the prison authorities vis-à-vis the applicant in late 2001 and early 2002 (see paragraphs 16 and 24 above)."

This raises an issue under the authorities ’ positive obligations flowing from Article 8 of the Convention. The Court has had occasion to hold that in view of the deep anxiety that the disappearance of a family member can cause, even for a short period, and the consequent importance for someone who has been arrested to be able to get in touch with his or her family promptly, there is an obligation under that Article to enable an detainee to contact them rapidly after being taken into custody (see Sarı and Çolak v. Turkey, nos. 42596/98 and 42603/98, § § 33-37, ECHR 2006-V (extracts)). In some cases this can also amount to an important safeguard to prevent arbitrary detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, § § 122-24, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III ). Indeed, in Bulgaria such an obligation is set out in section 243 of the 2009 Act (see paragraph 26 above). As evidenced by that provision, as well as the other relevant provisions of Bulgarian law, European Union law and international law (see paragraphs 23 to 27 above), that obligation takes on an added importance when the detainee is an alien whose family may be in a different country."

In the present case, the applicant was kept handcuffed throughout his stay in the police detention after his arrest, and was not allowed to use the telephone (see paragraph 7 above). Since he did not speak Bulgarian, it is also doubtful whether he could properly articulate his wish to do so in the apparent absence of proper interpretation facilities. His inability to express himself in Bulgarian must have also seriously restricted his capacity to communicate with the custodial staff or his co-detainees in the pre-trial detention facility. Moreover, he did not have any money on him when he was arrested; that prevented him from obtaining a phonecard enabling him to use the cardphone available in the detention facility (see paragraph 14 above). Thus, he was not able to inform anyone of his deprivation of liberty for twelve days, until, with the help of a co-detainee, he obtained access to a telephone and contacted the consulate of France in Sofia on 5 February 2014, which in turn informed his parents of his arrest and detention (ibid.).

The Government did not specify which remedies they had in mind, or cite any examples. Although a claim under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 32 above) does not appear inconceivable in respect of an omission by the detention facility ’ s administration to comply with its obligations under section 243 of the 2009 Act, its practicability has not been clearly demonstrated (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Posevini v. Bulgaria, no. 63638/14, § § 36-42, 19 January 2017). Since it is not for the Court to inquire into the point of its own motion at this stage of the proceedings, it leaves the question whether that remedy would have been effective in this case open. Assuming, as the applicant implied, that he had no effective domestic remedy in respect of this grievance, the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention started to run when the situation of which he complained ended, that is, on 5 February 2014 (see, mutatis mutandis, Mifsud v.

Compliance with that obligation with regard to persons in custody bears some particularities, as any detention which is itself lawful and justified inevitably entails some limitations on their rights under Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000-X; Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, § 106, ECHR 2015; and Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 11138/10, § 190, ECHR 2016 ). Thus, when assessing compliance with the requirements of that provision with respect to their contacts with the outside world, regard must be had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, § 74, Series A no. 131, and Dikme v. Turkey, no. 20869/92, § 117, ECHR 2000-VIII ). Indeed, some restrictions of those contacts, such as limitations on the number and duration of visits, are not of themselves incompatible with Article 8 (see Khoroshenko, cited above, § 123, with further references ). The same goes for correspondence (see, among other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 45, Series A no. 18; Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 98, Series A no. 61; and Szuluk v. the United Kingdom, no. 36936/05, § 46, ECHR 2009 ). As for telephone calls, Article 8 does not in itself guarantee such a right, especially if there exist adequate possibilities for written correspondence. If telephone facilities are, however, made available, they may, again in view of the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment, also be subject to restrictions (see A.B. v. the Netherlands, no. 37328/97, § § 92-93, 29 January 2002; Davison v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 52990/08, 2 March 2010; and Nusret Kaya and Others v.

But it also means that the law must be adequately accessible and formulated with sufficient precision (ibid., §§ 87-88). Although that does not entail that the all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference have to be laid down in the substantive law itself, the requirements of Article 8 § 2 are not met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of the substantive law are set out in internal orders of which the detainees have not been made sufficiently aware (ibid., §§ 88-89 and 93-94 ). As evident from that judgment, and from the Court ’ s case-law relating to the accessibility of the law more generally (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § § 50-52, Series A no. 30; Groppera Radio AG and Others v.

The Government did not submit copies of those orders, or say anything about the manner in which they had been brought to the applicant ’ s attention ( ibid. ). It was thus not established by the Government that he was made adequately aware of them, especially given that he did not speak Bulgarian. The restrictions on his visits and use of the cardphone appear to have flowed precisely from the internal arrangements in the pre-trial detention facility, which were governed by those orders (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above).

The investigator also noted that handwriting report no. 2692 dated 6 April 2007 had indicated that the statement written on 3 December 2006 had been signed by M.M. However, he also noted in the decision that forensic expert report no. 32 dated 25 April 2007 had stated that M.M. had not been able to move, speak or write immediately after the incident as he had been in a state of shock as a result of his burns. The decision also recorded that chemical analysis report no. 2375 of 19 March 2007 had concluded that there had been no trace of oil products in samples taken from the cell walls or of carbonised particles.

As regards the statements by some inmates that the fire had broken out at approximately 6 a.m., that it had taken an hour for the prison guards to open the door of the cell and that M.M. had died as a result of their negligence, the investigator noted that the cells of the inmates in question were situated far from M.M. ’ s cell and that therefore their statements could not be considered as reliable. The investigator also questioned Gobustan Prison ’ s paramedic ( feldşer ) (N.B.) who had given first aid to M.M. after the fire. N.B. stated that he had been informed by telephone at home about the incident at around 7 a.m. on 3 December 2006. He had taken a taxi to the prison and had arrived fifteen minutes later. He had given first aid to M.M. but his condition had worsened at around 8 a.m. and he had requested his transfer to a hospital. N.B. stated that he had accompanied M.M. in the car that had transported him to the hospital but they had not arrived until 2.45 p.m. because they had waited for an hour and fifteen minutes for the car to be repaired after it had broken down. In that connection, the investigator referred to letter no. 17/1/15-954 of 27 February 2007 from the Prisons Service of the Ministry of Justice, confirming that the car transporting M.M. to the hospital had arrived at 2.45 p.m. and that the delay in his transfer had been due to the fact that the car had broken down on its way to the hospital. The letter also contained information about M.M. ’ s medical history, pointing out that he had previously been admitted five times to that medical establishment, had been diagnosed four times with epilepsy and had received the appropriate treatment."

                "55. The Court observes at the outset that the applicant alleged that the domestic authorities were responsible for his son ’ s death for the following reasons. Firstly, he argued that the prison guards had tortured his son before the fire on the night of 3 December 2006 which had resulted in his death and that the fire had not been accidental but had been aimed at hiding the real cause of death. Secondly, he contended that his son had not been provided with adequate medical assistance after the incident as there had been an unjustified delay in transferring him to hospital. In addition to that, he argued that his son ’ s conditions of detention had not been compatible with his illness because his medical history meant that he should not have been left alone in his cell."
            ],
            [
                "56. The Court thus considers that the questions to decide in the present case are, firstly, whether the applicant ’ s son was tortured by the prison guards, which resulted in his death, as the applicant has alleged, and, secondly, whether the domestic authorities complied with their obligation to protect the life of the applicant ’ s son by taking all the necessary measures."

            [
                "57. As regards the first question, the Court reiterates that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Nevertheless, in the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, where allegations are made under that Article the Court must apply the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. In assessing evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, §§ 264-65, 18 June 2002, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 131, ECHR 2014)."
            ],
            [
                "58. Bearing in mind the above principles, the Court notes that the applicant alleged that his son had died before the fire after being tortured by the prison guards. In support of his allegation he relied on three photographs of his son taken immediately after the fire."
            ],
            [
                "59. However, the Court observes that the photographs in question contradict the applicant ’ s allegation that his son died as a result of torture inflicted the night before the fire as it is clear from them that M.M. was still alive after the fire, when the photographs were taken. The Court also notes that although the Government failed to provide the Court with a copy of post-mortem forensic report no. 147 dated 5 December 2006, it transpires from the domestic authorities ’ decisions that the forensic report in question only confirmed the existence of numerous serious burns on M.M. ’ s body."
            ],
            [
                "60. In the light of the above, the Court cannot conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the applicant ’ s son died as a result of torture by the prison guards, as alleged by the applicant."
            ],
            [
                "61. As regards the second question, the Court, based on all the material in its possession, points out at the outset that although the parties differ in their view as to the exact time the fire began, other facts relating to the events of 3 December 2006 are not in dispute. In particular, it does not appear to be in dispute that the applicant ’ s son was taken out of his cell by the prison guards at around 7 a.m. and that there were numerous serious burns on his body. M.M. was given first aid by a paramedic at Gobustan Prison and at around 11.45 a.m. he was sent by car to a hospital in Baku, where he arrived at 2.45 p.m. and died at 3.30 p.m."
            ],
            [
                "62. In that connection, the Court notes that even assuming that it only took fifteen minutes after the telephone call for the paramedic to arrive at the prison, which is both remote and large, as he stated during the investigation, it is struck by the fact that there was no medical staff on duty at the time of the incident. The Court further notes that the Government did not provide any explanation as to why the prison authorities failed to secure immediate transfer of the applicant ’ s son to a hospital and it took until 11.45 a.m. for them to do so, despite the fact that he had suffered serious burns before being taken out of his cell at 7 a.m. The Court observes that the prison authorities could not have been ignorant of the seriousness of M.M. ’ s injuries and that there was no doubt that he required the requisite treatment immediately. In those circumstances, while in no way speculating as to M.M. ’ s chances of survival if he had been taken to hospital immediately, the Court considers that the prison authorities should have been aware of the risk that a delayed transfer presented to his life (compare Mehmet Şentürk and Bekir Şentürk v. Turkey, no. 13423/09, § 96, ECHR 2013). The seriousness of the situation was also confirmed by the prison paramedic, who stated that M.M. ’ s state of health had deteriorated at around 8 a.m. when he had requested his transfer to hospital (see paragraph 19 above). However, the prison authorities failed to decide on that transfer in a timely manner, waiting until 11.45 a.m."

            [
                "63. The Court also observes that the car taking the applicant ’ s son to hospital left Gobustan Prison at 11.45 a.m., but did not arrive in Baku until 2.45 p.m. The Court cannot accept the Government ’ s arguments that such a delay could be explained by the fact that the distance between Gobustan Prison and Baku was 125 km, and that the car in question had broken down."

In that connection, the Court notes that the Government submitted that Gobustan Prison was 125 km from Baku whereas in a previous case they submitted that the prison was 45 km away (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 131, 29 November 2007). In any event, the Government failed to explain why the prison staff transporting the applicant ’ s son, who was in a critical state, to the hospital did not call an ambulance when their car broke down instead of spending an hour and fifteen minutes repairing it (see paragraph 19 above)."

Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, §§ 127-130, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Taïs, cited above, §§ 99-102; Huylu, cited above, §§ 61-68; and Jasinskis, cited above, §§ 62-67)."

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 69, ECHR 2002- II )."

The authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or people responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard. Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Ilhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, ECHR 2000-VII, § 63). Moreover, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice. In all cases, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to such an extent as is necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Tsintsabadze v.

Nevertheless, it considers that by denying him access to medical care and leaving him in solitary confinement in the absence of sufficient and appropriate monitoring or supervision, the authorities put his health and life in danger. Their failure to take necessary steps in order to ensure that he was properly examined and treated had, given the circumstances, resulted in his death (compare, Jasinskis v.

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; see also Hurtado v. Switzerland, 28 January 1994, § 79, Series A no. 280-A, opinion of the Commission; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, §§ 95 and 100, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI; and Khudobin v. Russia, (no. 59696/00, § 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... (extracts) )."

                "139. The “ adequacy” of medical assistance remains the most difficult element to determine. The CPT proclaimed the principle of the equivalence of health care in prison with that in the outside community (see “Relevant International Instruments” above ). However, the Court does not always adhere to this standard, at least when it comes to medical assistance to convicted prisoners (as opposed to those detained on remand). On several occasions the Court has held that Article 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as securing to every detained person medical assistance of the same level as “ in the best civilian clinics ” (see the case of Mirilashivili v. Russia (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007 ). In the case of Grishin v. Russia the Court went further, holding that it was “prepared to accept that in principle the resources of medical facilities within the penitentiary system are limited compared to those of civil [ian] clinics” ( no. 30983/02, § 76, 15 November 2007)."

That standard should be “compatible with the human dignity” of a detainee, but should also take into account “ the practical demands of imprisonment”."

                "141. Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the applicant complained that his eyesight had seriously deteriorated in prison. Indeed, that applicant had lost almost all of the sight in his left eye, whereas he was already blind in the right eye at the moment of his arrest. However, having examined the materials in its possession, the Court is unable to conclude that the deterioration of the applicant ’ s eyesight was imputable to the authorities, or that his poor eyesight as such was incompatible with his detention from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention."

                "142. The situation with the applicant ’ s other health conditions, namely Aids, combined with various concomitant diseases and the lymph cancer, raises more concern. The Court notes that certain facts are not disputed by the parties. First, it is clear that the applicant was and remains seriously ill, that he is suffering from advanced Aids, and that in 2006–2008 he developed a number of opportunistic infections and lymph cancer. The parties seem to agree that the applicant suffers from his ailments and that his condition has deteriorated since his arrest."

                "143. Secondly, the applicant did not dispute that while in the remand prison he received certain forms of basic medical assistance. In particular, he received, either from his relatives or from the prison pharmacy, commonly used anti-inflammatory and anti-viral drugs and antiseptics."

            [
                "144. Thirdly, the applicant admitted that he had refused to undergo a blood test after his arrest in April 2004. However, the Court attaches little importance to that episode. The applicant refused to undergo that test before the first symptoms of HIV appeared. The Court considers that the central issue in the present case is the treatment the applicant received after he was found to be HIV-positive, namely from September 2006 onwards. The first question to answer in this respect is whether the applicant had access to anti-retroviral drugs.",

                "145. The Court recalls that the HAART treatment was prescribed to the applicant for the first time in November 2006. The doctors concluded that the applicant could be kept in the remand prison provided that he received proper treatment and underwent regular monitoring of his health in a specialised medical institution. However, the applicant ’ s medical file does not contain any clear indication that the HAART treatment was administered in the first half of 2007."

            [
                "146. The Court further notes that it was not until 10 July 2007 that the applicant signed a written statement accepting the HAART treatment. As transpires from the parties ’ submissions, such a statement was a pre-requisite for commencement of the HAART treatment. There is no information indicating that the applicant refused any treatment before June 2007. The Court concludes that the HAART treatment was not proposed to the applicant between November 2006, when it was recommended, and June 2007."
            ],
            [
                "147. As to the following period, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s medical file and official reports produced by the Government attested that on several occasions the applicant refused “ an examination”, “injections”, and “treatment” (the first such entry in the medical file is dated 15 June 2007). However, those documents did not specify what kind of treatment was offered to the applicant and what examinations he was supposed to undergo. The Court reiterates that the authorities of the penitentiary institution should have kept a record of the applicant ’ s state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 83, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)). Logically, such a medical record should contain sufficient information specifying what kind of treatment the patient was prescribed, what treatment he actually received, who and when administered it, how the applicant ’ s state of health was monitored, etc (see the 3rd General Report of the CPT, quoted in the “Relevant International Instruments” part above). If the applicant ’ s medical file is not specific enough in these respects (as in the case at hand), the Court may make inferences. Furthermore, the Court observes that in September 2007 the investigator recommended that the prison authorities ensure a medical examination of the applicant and the administration of the HAART treatment to him. In the circumstances the Court concludes that, in all probability, the applicant did not receive the HAART treatment from the prison pharmacy."
            ],
            [
                "148. That finding, however, is not decisive. First of all, the Court does not consider that in the circumstances the authorities were under an unqualified obligation to administer the HAART treatment to the applicant free of charge. The Court is aware of the fact that modern anti-retroviral drugs remain very expensive (see, mutatis mutandis, the cases of Karara v. Finland, no. 40900/98, Commission decision of 29 May 1998; see also S .C.C. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 46553/99, 15 February 2000; and Arcila Henao v. The Netherlands (dec.), no. 13669/03, 24 June 2003). The Court refers to its findings in the recent case of N. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 26565/05, § 44, 27 May 2008), where it recognised that “advances in medical science, together with social and economic differences between countries, entail that the level of treatment available in the Contracting State and the country of origin may vary considerably”. That case concerned the provision of free health care to an alien suffering from Aids. In the Court ’ s opinion, broadly the same principle applies in the area of provision of health care to detained nationals : the Contracting States are bound to provide all medical care that their resources might permit."
            ],
            [
                "149. Secondly, as follows from the applicant ’ s medical file, he did not depend on the pharmacy ’ s stock and could receive necessary medication from his relatives. The applicant did not allege that procuring those medicines imposed an excessive financial burden on him or on his relatives (cf. Mirilashvili v. Russia, (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007, and Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 29 November 2007 ). In such circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that the absence of the anti-retroviral drugs in the prison pharmacy was not, as such, contrary to Article 3 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "150. The Court notes, however, that the applicant ’ s complaint concerns not so much access to the necessary drugs as the authorities ’ refusal to place him in a specialised clinic. The Court accepts that complex medicinal treatment often requires constant supervision by specialist doctors, and taking drugs without such supervision may cause more harm than good. As follows from the official reports produced by the Government, the applicant insisted on his placement in a specialised hospital in order to undergo the HAART treatment. Therefore, the next question to be answered is whether that was a legitimate claim, or, as the Government suggested, a mere pretence.",

                "151. The Court wishes to recall certain facts which, in its opinion, are crucial for understanding the applicant ’ s situation. From the Government ’ s submissions it follows that the prison hospital was equipped and staffed to treat a broad range of illnesses, in particular those prevalent in the Russian prison system, such as tuberculosis. However, it is clear that the prison hospital did not have a department specialised in the treatment of Aids. The Court notes that one of the doctors in the prison hospital had undergone training in HIV diagnostics. However, there is no evidence that that training included anti-retroviral therapy. Furthermore, there is no information that the HAART therapy has ever been administered within the prison hospital, and that the medical staff working there had the necessary experience and practical skills for administering it."
            ],
            [
                "152. The Court notes that, among other departments, the prison hospital had a department for infectious diseases, where the applicant was placed in October 2007. According to Decree no. 170 of the Ministry of Health (see the “Relevant Domestic Law” part above), if there was no specialised clinic available, a patient suffering from Aids could be placed in an infectious diseases hospital. The text of the Decree shows that even in domestic terms an infectious diseases hospital is not regarded as a “specialised clinic” for the treatment of Aids : it is a substitute where no specialised clinic is available."
            ],
            [
                "153. The Court further notes that on 23 October 2007 the applicant was examined in the Moscow AIDS Centre which, indisputably, was a “ specialised clinic”. The doctors concluded that the applicant should undergo further in-patient examination and treatment in that Centre. On 26 October 200 7 the applicant was admitted to the prison hospital. Five days later the investigator in charge of the applicant ’ s case decided that the applicant ’ s diseases could not be treated in the conditions of the remand prison and asked the court to release the applicant on bail. However, ten days later the investigator changed his mind and refused the application for release on bail. The applicant ’ s medical file does not contain any evidence that between 31 October and 9 November 2007 the applicant underwent any new medical examination which would rebut the conclusions of the earlier report. If there is any explanation for the sudden change in the investigator ’ s position, it does not pertain to the medical needs of the applicant."
            ],
            [
                "154. It is true that in the following weeks the applicant refused examination by the prison doctors. The Court admits that in certain circumstances the refusal to undergo examination or treatment may suggest that the applicant ’ s state of health is not as critical as he claims (see Gelfmann v. France, cited above, § 56). However, in the circumstances of the present case the applicant ’ s attitude was understandable. Notwithstanding a serious deterioration in the applicant ’ s health, and despite the specialist doctors ’ clear recommendation that he should be transferred to an outside specialised clinic, he remained in the prison hospital. Furthermore, the prison doctors attested that the applicant was fit to support the continuing detention and could participate in the criminal proceedings (see the court ’ s ruling of 15 November 2007), despite the fact that (a) the most recent medical examination had reached the opposite conclusion, and (b) since then the applicant had not undergone any new comprehensive examination, for whatever reason."

            [
                "155. On 21 December 2007 the Court, having examined the evidence before it, decided to obtain more information about the applicant ’ s state of health. It indicated, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the Government and the applicant should form a bi-partisan medical commission which would answer a number of questions, formulated by the Court. The Government replied that the creation of such commissions would be contrary to the domestic legislation. However, they did not refer to any law which would prevent the examination of a patient by a mixed medical commission, to include doctors of his choice. The Court further observes that the applicant ’ s health was examined on several occasions by mixed commissions made up of doctors from various clinics. In any event, the State “should not deny the possibility to receive medical assistance from other sources, such as the detainee ’ s family doctor or other qualified doctors” (see Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 82, 4 October 2005 ). In the circumstances the Court considers that the Government ’ s refusal to form a mixed medical commission was arbitrary. The Court will therefore draw adverse inferences from the State ’ s refusal to implement the interim measure."
            ],
            [
                "156. To sum up, the Court concludes that as from the end of October 2007, at the very least, the applicant ’ s medical condition required his transfer to a hospital specialised in the treatment of Aids. The prison hospital was not an appropriate institution for these purposes."
            ],
            [
                "157. Finally, the Court observes that it does not detect any serious practical obstacles for the immediate transfer of the applicant to a specialised medical institution. Thus, the Moscow AIDS Centre (a clinic which would most probably have been the applicant ’ s destination in the event of his transfer from the prison hospital ) was located in the same city, and it was prepared to accept the applicant for in-patient treatment. It appears that the applicant was able to assume most of the expenses related to the treatment. Furthermore, in view of the applicant ’ s state of health and his previous conduct, the Court considers that the security risks he might have presented at that time, if any, were negligible compared to the health risks he faced (see Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, §§ 47, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX ). In any event, the security arrangements made by the prison authorities in Hospital no. 60 did not appear very complicated."

                "158. In the final analysis, the Court considers that the national authorities failed to take sufficient care of the applicant ’ s health to ensure that he did not suffer treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, at least until his transfer to an external haematological hospital on 8 February 2008. This undermined his dignity and entailed particularly acute hardship, causing suffering beyond that inevitably associated with a prison sentence and the illnesses he suffered from, which amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.

The Government ’ s argument that the legislation at issue was only applicable to convicted criminals was contrary to common sense. As the Constitutional Court of Russia had held in one of its cases, the domestic courts, in deciding on whether to place a criminal suspect in detention on remand, should do so only if the person faced a real prospect of punishment if convicted. Thus, remanding in custody somebody who was due to be released after conviction was senseless. The applicant further claimed that his detention after 2 March 2008 had been unlawful.

Having examined his arguments, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine all of them; instead, the Court will concentrate on his third allegation, namely that his continuous detention exceeded the “reasonable time” requirement of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."

A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are “relevant and sufficient” reasons to justify the continued detention (see, as a classic authority, Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, § 12, Series A no. 7, and Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, § 52, Series A no. 319 ‑ A ). The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the detention to be lawful under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention (see, among many authorities, W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, § 30, Series A no. 254 ‑ A ). However, after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty."

Austria, 10 November 1969, § 15, Series A no. 9); the risk that the accused, if released, would take action to prejudice the administration of justice (see Wemhoff, cited above, § 14) or commit further offences (see Matznetter v. Austria, 10 November 1969, § 9, Series A no. 10) or cause public disorder (see Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, § 51, Series A no. 207)."

Further, the Court has reiterated that shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in matters of detention is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, § 67, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions. Arguments for and against release must not be “general and abstract” (see Clooth v. Belgium, 12 December 1991, § 44, Series A no. 225), but contain references to the specific facts and the applicant ’ s personal circumstances justifying his detention (see Panchenko v.

The Court reiterates in this respect that the authorities cannot justify the continuing detention by a mere reference to such risks; they must refer to specific facts about the applicant ’ s behaviour, his personal circumstances, etc (see Vlasov v.

In addition, the Government in their observations referred to the statements by unidentified witnesses, and by Ms M., who, according to the Government, had received threats from the applicant in the past. However, the Court observes that these statements were not referred to by the domestic courts. The Court reiterates that it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts ’ decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova, cited above, § 72; Ilijkov, cited above, § 86; and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ).

Thus, the Court does not see how any of the facts could have proved the risk of re-offending, to which the authorities referred as from 23 August 2006. The Court points out that the charges against the applicant concerned the period of 1998-1999 (misappropriation of shares) and 2000-2002 (personal income - tax evasion). Given that the acts imputed to the applicant had allegedly been committed by him in his capacity as head of the legal department of Yukos, a post which he had occupied until 2003, it is dubious that the applicant would still have been able to continue his alleged criminal activity in 2006 - 2007, and especially after 29 March 200 6, when an interim receiver was appointed by the court to administer Yukos within the framework of the bankruptcy proceedings."

In support of that finding the courts referred, first, to the severity of the sentence faced. The Court accepts that it is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention or to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko v. Russia, cited above, § 102; Goral v. Poland, no. 38654/97, § 68, 30 October 2003; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § 101, 1 March 2007 )."

The same concerns his absence from the court hearing of 6 April 2006, at which only his lawyer was present.

In this respect the Court notes that the investigation in the applicant ’ s case was terminated on 12 December 2006. Therefore, by the end of 2006 all witnesses had been questioned, all materials collected and expert examinations conducted. Furthermore, after 29 March 2006 the company was under the control of the interim receiver, and, after 4 August 2006, that of the bankruptcy trustee, with whom the applicant had no relations whatsoever.

On 15 September 2006 the applicant was found to be HIV-positive. On 22 November 2006 the doctors noted that the applicant ’ s condition was worsening, and recommended HAART treatment for him. The Court reiterates its findings under Article 3 of the Convention, namely that this treatment required constant medical supervision in a specialist clinic, and that without such treatment the applicant ’ s health and even life were at serious risk.

He has already spent more than 34 months in detention. Some of the applicant ’ s illnesses are incurable. It appears that the prospects of any treatment he receives or may receive are uncertain.

To determine whether these measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has to explore the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law and check how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer – or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny –, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and – where a lawyer ’ s office is concerned – whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Camenzind v.

They allowed the prosecution authorities to search for “ documents and objects important for the investigation”. Such wording gave the prosecution unrestricted discretion in determining which documents were “of interest” for the criminal investigation. The Court recalls that in the case of Smirnov v. Russia, cited above, the vagueness of the search warrant was the key element which led the Court to conclude that the search in the lawyer ’ s flat had been incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention. The Court came to the same conclusions in the case of Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria ( no. 65755/01, § § 34 et seq., 22 May 2008 ), where the domestic authorities searched the office of a lawyer suspected of kidnapping and extortion. In that case the Court held that “neither the application for its issue [of the warrant] nor the warrant itself specified what items and documents were expected to be found in the applicant ’ s office, or how they would be relevant to the investigation. Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch at all upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be removed”. The same characteristics can be found in the present case. The search warrants delivered by the Simonovskiy District Court on 4 and 5 April 2006 gave the authorities unfettered discretion in deciding what documents to seize, and did not contain any reservation in respect of privileged documents, although the authorities knew that the applicant was a Bar Member and could have possessed documents conferred to him by his clients."

Bulgaria, cited above, § 41). However, the Court notes that by the time of the searches the official investigation into the business activities of the Yukos management had been going on for almost three years. From the very beginning of the investigation the authorities should have known that the applicant had been head of the legal department of Yukos in 1998– 1999, when the crimes were allegedly committed, and could have had in his possession certain documents, electronic data and other evidence pertinent to the events at issue. Therefore, the lack of proper reasoning and vagueness of the search warrant cannot be explained by the urgency of the situation."

Furthermore, such measures had been taken even before the applicant ’ s complaint had been communicated to the Russian Government. The quality of medical services in the prison hospital was not only equal to but in some respect better than in many civilian hospitals. Thus, the applicant ’ s transfer to a civilian hospital was not necessary from a medical point of view.

Further, the Government refused to cooperate with the bipartisan medical commission requested by the Court under Rule 39 on 20 December 2007, on the ground that such a commission was incompatible with Russian law.

When the applicant honestly replied that he could not sign such a statement, he was not transferred. Further, at the Supreme Court hearing of 22 January 2008, which was widely covered in the Russian media, the applicant disclosed that the prosecution had made several offers of release on health grounds in exchange for false testimony, confirming that his lawyer had been present and had witnessed those incidents.

The Court concluded that “the obligation set out in Article 34, in fine, requires the Contracting States to refrain ... also from any act or omission which, by destroying or removing the subject matter of an application, would make it pointless or otherwise prevent the Court from considering it under its normal procedure” (§ 102). That conclusion was qualified in the Shamayev and Others v.

Finally, the Court recalls its findings in the Olaechea Cahuas v. Spain judgment ( no. 24668/03, § 1, ECHR 2006 ‑ ...

In Shtukaturov v.

The first was indicated on 27 November 2007, and then confirmed in December 2007 and January 2008. The Court, in view of the critical state of the applicant ’ s health, invited the Government to transfer him to a specialist medical institution. However, it was not until 8 February that the applicant was transferred to Hospital no. 60. The Court leaves open the question whether Hospital no. 60 can be considered a “specialist institution” in view of the recent developments in the applicant ’ s medical condition. What is clear is that for over two months the Government continuously refused to implement the interim measure, thus putting the applicant ’ s health and even life in danger. The Government did not suggest that the measure indicated under Rule 39 was practically unfeasible; on the contrary, the applicant ’ s subsequent transfer to Hospital no. 60 shows that this measure was relatively easy to implement. In the circumstances, the Court considers that the non-implementation of the measure is fully attributable to the authorities ’ reluctance to cooperate with the Court."

Namely, they did not allow the applicant ’ s examination by a mixed medical commission which would include doctors of his choice. In indicating that measure, the Court sought to obtain more detailed information about the applicant ’ s state of health and the medical facilities existing in the remand prison, which would allow it to corroborate or rebut the parties ’ conflicting accounts. Despite the applicant ’ s attempt to form such a team, the Government refused to cooperate with him in this respect. The Court recalls that in its analysis under Article 3 of the Convention it found that the Government ’ s justification of their refusal to allow such examination was not satisfactory (see paragraph 155 above). Bearing in mind that the applicant is seriously ill, was detained, and was therefore unable to collect all necessary information himself, the Court considers that such a position on the part of the authorities amounts, in the circumstances, to an attempt to hinder the applicant in pursuing his application under Article 34 of the Convention. The fact that the Court found itself in a position to decide the case on the basis of the information available to it does not, in the circumstances, affect this conclusion (see the case-law cited above, in particular the case of Olaechea Cahuas v. Spain; see, by contrast, Öcalan v. Turkey, no. 46221/99, § 201, 12 March 2003 )."

No later than three days after the detainee’s arrival at the detention facility, he should receive a medical examination, including fluorography. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee’s complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

As can be seen from a discharge certificated issued in December 2005, the applicant was given a recommendation of exclusion of medication by this drug. It appears that he was later on given a prescription for other drugs (see paragraph 17 above). Having examined the available materials, including the applicant’s medical record for 2005 and the expert reports issued in 2004, 2009 and 2010 (see paragraphs 17, 20 and 28 above), and in the absence of any alternative evidence, the Court considers that no violation of Article 3 of the Convention has been convincingly established on that account (see, for comparison, Polufakin and Chernyshev v.

It has not been alleged that the applicant was refused counselling on the appropriate diet to be observed. In any event, it has not been shown that the ration provided to all detainees in the colony, including the applicant, was incompatible with the applicant’s diabetes status.

It appears that he could not, however, use it because of the progressive retraction of the gums. For unspecified reasons, the applicant handed over the denture to another person (this seems to have been his lawyer).

This is especially so when such grievances involve complex medical issues.

The Court has found no reason to disagree with these assessments. Therefore, as regards the grievances mentioned under (i)-(iii) in paragraph 61 above, the Court concludes that the applicant, who was represented before this Court by a lawyer, did not provide sufficient and convincing arguments disclosing that any allegedly serious failings on the part of the national authorities in complying with medical recommendations and prescriptions were such as to violate the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention."

The Ukhta colony management (in the same region) made a different statement, considering that orthopaedic footwear was not readily available to the applicant (ibid). While these statements relate to the periods of the applicant’s detention in these facilities between 1996 and 2001, there is no indication that his medical condition in this respect has improved significantly or that it was properly (re)assessed in or after 2005 during his detention in the Perm region, where he has been serving the sentence of life imprisonment.

However, in respect of non-criminal matters there is no absolute right to be present at one’s trial, except in respect of a limited category of cases, such as those where the personal character and manner of life of the person concerned is directly relevant to the subject matter of the case, or where the decision involves the person’s conduct (see, among others, Kabwe and Chungu v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 29647/08 and 33269/08, 2 February 2010)."

Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, § 58, Series A no. 263, with further references). Although the earlier cases emphasised that a hearing must be held before a court of first and only instance unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with one (see, for instance, Håkansson and Sturesson v.

It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005).

Even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words “thank you” in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence, it had to be noted that the Regional Court, including Judge P., had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self ‑ determination of others. Assuming that Judge P. had indeed made the remark in question, his “advice” had therefore constituted in substance nothing more than the application of the Regional Court’s said findings to a particular case. The remark had further been made in the context of a confidential exchange between the participants in the proceedings in the absence of the applicant.

He was suffering from a sexual preference disorder, namely sexual sadism, as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current version (ICD-10); [1] this disorder had caused, and been manifested in, his brutal offence, and still persisted. The court, having regard to the experts’ findings, observed that the applicant had hidden the sadistic motives behind his offence in the proceedings before the trial court in 1999, which, despite some indications of sexual deviance, had then interpreted the offence as an intended rape which had failed. The applicant, who had given diverging versions of the motive for his offence, had only admitted in 2005/2006, during his examination by a psychological and a psychiatric expert, that in his murder he had put into practice intensifying fantasies of exercising power over women by attacking their neck and by masturbating on their inanimate bodies.

In this twin-track system of sanctions, penalties (see Articles 38 et seq. of the Criminal Code) mainly consist of prison sentences and fines, which are fixed in accordance with the defendant’s guilt (Article 46 § 1 of the Criminal Code). Measures of correction and prevention (see Articles 61 et seq. of the Criminal Code) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital (Article 63 of the Criminal Code), in a detoxification facility (Article 64 of the Criminal Code) or in preventive detention (Articles 66 et seq. of the Criminal Code). The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders and to protect the public from them. They may be imposed on criminally liable offenders in addition to their punishment (cf. Articles 63 et seq.).

In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged subsequently, or ordered subsequently under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code or section 7(2) of the Juvenile Courts Act, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether there was a high risk that the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their personality or their conduct, would commit the most serious types of violent crimes or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1(1) of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 85 below).

It stressed, in particular, that the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment and the principles laid down in Article 7 of the Convention required individualised and intensified therapeutic provision and care for the persons concerned. In line with the Court’s findings in the case of M. v.

The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., paragraphs 102 and 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of penalty with that under the Convention.

The delegation gained the distinct impression that the staff themselves were not clear as to how to approach their work with these inmates. As well as empowering inmates to take charge of their lives in custody, there is a need for on-going support to deal with indefinite detention, as well as to address the legacy of serious past histories of aberrant behaviour and apparent psychological problems. Psychological care and support appeared to be seriously inadequate; the CPT recommends that immediate steps be taken to remedy this shortcoming.",

The difficult question of how to implement in practice a humane and coherent policy regarding the treatment of persons placed in Sicherungsverwahrung needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency at the highest level. Working with this group of inmates is bound to be one of the hardest challenges facing prison staff.",

The approach requires a high level of care involving a team of multi-disciplinary staff, intensive work with inmates on an individual basis (via promptly-prepared individualised plans), within a coherent framework for progression towards release, which should be a real option. The system should also allow for the maintenance of family contacts, when appropriate.",

                "10. The purpose of the 2013 visit was to review the implementation in practice of the new system of preventive detention and the action taken by the relevant authorities in this connection since the 2010 visit. To this end, the delegation focused on the situation of persons in preventive detention in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate (...).",
                "14. As regards conditions of detention, the delegation was particularly impressed by the newly constructed unit for preventive detention at Diez Prison. All accommodation rooms were spacious (measuring some 18 m² including the sanitary annexe) and well-equipped (including ... a toilet, shower and kitchenette). (...) In addition, there were various association and activity rooms (including a fitness room). It is also praiseworthy that, during the day, inmates could move freely within the building in which the unit is located and could go outside into the open air or to another detention unit whenever they wished (throughout the day and, except at weekends, also in the evening).",
                "15. At Freiburg Prison, material conditions were generally good in the new unit for preventive detention. All the rooms were in a very good state of repair, spacious (some 14 m² without counting the sanitary annexe) and well-equipped (...). On every floor, there was a large living/dining room (measuring some 50 m² and equipped with tables, chairs, a sofa, a television set, a refrigerator and plants), a kitchen and a laundry room. In addition, the detention unit comprised a large workshop, a computer room and an art therapy room. That said, it is somewhat regrettable that the entire detention unit remained rather prison-like and that the freedom of movement of inmates within the establishment and access to the outdoor exercise yard was more restricted than at Diez Prison (in particular, at weekends). (...)",

                "17. As regards the regime and treatment measures ( Behandlungsmassnahmen ), the delegation was informed that, at Freiburg Prison, all inmates were offered work, individual counselling sessions with a psychologist and a range of recreational activities. In addition, a number of group therapies were provided, including a treatment programme for sex offenders (10 participants, duration 1½ years), social competence training (6 participants, duration six to seven months), art therapy (5 participants), drama and movement therapy (5 participants) and a programme for control of addiction (9 participants). Out of a total of 58 inmates, 48 participated in individual counselling sessions, including 13 who were also involved in one of the above-mentioned group therapies and eleven who were involved in two treatment groups. Seven inmates refused to take part in any therapy, two were new arrivals and not assigned yet to a treatment programme and one was apparently not capable of participating in any treatment programme (due to brain damage). The team of specialised staff comprised three psychologists and four social workers (one on each floor). The delegation was informed that, based on the staff/inmate ratio applied in sociotherapeutic institutions, the unit for preventive detention would need at least six full-time psychologists. (...) The head of the psychology service indicated that, due to the limited staff resources, it was not possible to organise individual therapy on a weekly basis (...), that it was not possible to reach out to those who were lacking any motivation and were unwilling to engage themselves in therapeutic measures and that it was not possible to organise milieu therapy in an effective manner.",
                "18. The situation appeared to be even more worrying at Diez Prison. Although a comprehensive and detailed concept for the treatment of persons in preventive detention had been prepared by the prison administration of Rhineland-Palatinate in May 2013, the visit revealed a striking discrepancy between theory and practice. Out of 40 inmates, only 24 were receiving individual therapy and only eight were participating in group therapy. It is also regrettable that no efforts had thus far been made by the prison administration to organise group sessions for art, music or drama therapy which may be particularly beneficial for those inmates who are unwilling or unable to participate in any other group therapy programme. Moreover, the delegation noted that attempts had to a large extent failed to motivate inmates to take part in weekly meetings in the living unit, which were organised by staff as part of the ongoing milieu therapy.",
                "19. The CPT acknowledges that the implementation of the new legislation governing preventive detention was still at an early stage and that it may take some time until all the planned measures are fully implemented in practice. However, there can be no doubt that the existing resources for treatment measures for persons in preventive detention in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate were insufficient to meet the requirements of the relevant federal and Länder legislation, namely to have a system of programmes focused on therapeutic needs and promoting individual liberty and motivation ( therapiegerichtet, freiheitsorientiert and motivationsfördernd). (...)",
                "The Committee recommends that the relevant authorities of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate redouble their efforts to further develop individual and group treatment measures which are offered to persons in preventive detention at Freiburg and Diez Prisons and increase the number of specialist staff accordingly.",
                "20. The delegation gained a favourable impression of the therapeutic measures offered to inmates at (...) the socio-therapeutic department at Diez Prison, which accommodated inmates in preventive detention who were considered to be suitable to undergo an intensive therapeutic programme for violent and/or sex offenders.

Under German penal law, a criminal who has committed a serious crime such as homicide or rape may be kept under secured custody ( Sicherungsverwahrung ) after having served his/her prison term. A decision on secured custody can only be taken by the court who issued the original verdict on the basis of expert medical advice. The term of custody is indefinite but subject to court review (...). The possibility of imposing secured custody can either be included in the original verdict itself or it can be ordered shortly before the prison term expires.",
                "202. The purpose of keeping a person under secured custody has no punitive element but aims at protecting the general public from crimes the perpetrator concerned is likely to commit. Accordingly, prison conditions are adapted to the specific situation and unnecessary restrictions are not applied.",
                "203. During the visit, the Commissioner discussed the issue of secured custody with several Länder authorities, judges and medical experts. The Commissioner is aware of the public pressure judges and medical experts are exposed to when they make decisions regarding the release of a person who might recommit a serious crime. It is impossible to predict with full certainty whether a person will actually re-offend. Psychiatrists regularly assess the behaviour of an imprisoned person who might act differently outside the prison. In addition, it is difficult to foresee all the conditions that wait for the offender outside the prison.",
                "204. The Commissioner calls for an extremely considerate application of secured custody. Alternative measures should also be considered before recourse to secured custody is taken. The Commissioner is concerned about the rising number of people deprived of their liberty under secured custody. He encourages the German authorities to commission independent studies on the implementation of secured custody in order to evaluate the measure in terms of protecting the general public and its impact on the detained individual.",
                "205. The Commissioner is also aware of proposed amendments which would allow the ex post imposition of secured custody on juvenile offenders in extreme cases. The Commissioner urges the German authorities to reconsider such proposals due to their extreme consequences on juvenile offenders. Alternative measures should be applied in the case of juvenile offenders whenever possible.",
                "206. Furthermore, the Commissioner was informed that persons kept under secured custody regularly experience a loss of future perspective and give up on themselves. This would appear to call for the provision of psychological or psychiatric care. The medical opinion may occasionally be divided on the efficacy of care provided to persons kept under secured custody, yet the possibility of their eventual rehabilitation and release should not be excluded. Accordingly, people held under secured custody should receive adequate medical treatment or other care that addresses their specific situation.”"

As regards the measures chosen by other Contracting Parties to the Convention to protect the public from convicted offenders of unsound mind who risk committing further serious offences on their release, the comparative law material before the Court shows the following. Out of the thirty-two Contracting States examined, ten allow for the application of protective measures entailing deprivation of liberty after a criminal sentence. Half of these States allow for such measures to be ordered after the imposition of the sentence. Such measures are imposed by a judicial body. In most of these States, these measures are not classified as “penalties” under domestic law. Facilities for enforcing such measures are quite varied, ranging from special detention facilities to psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric wards in prison and regular detention centres.",

The strike-out decision was taken under Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government acknowledging a breach of the Convention in this regard because the applicant had not been detained in a suitable institution for mental health patients during the said period (see Ilnseher v.

In the Court’s judgments to date, the German term “nachträgliche Sicherungsverwahrung”, that is, preventive detention which was imposed on a convicted offender in a judgment adopted separately from, and after a previous criminal conviction, has been translated into English by “retrospective” or “retrospectively ordered” preventive detention, and into French by “ détention de sûreté rétroactive ” or “ détention de sûreté ordonnée rétroactivement ”."

The Grand Chamber agrees that there is a retrospective element in the order of such preventive detention in that it is a precondition for the order that the person concerned was sentenced in a previous judgment to a term of imprisonment for a serious criminal offence. However, there is equally a strong prospective element in that the order must be based on an ex nunc assessment that it is likely that the person concerned would commit new offences in the future. That prospective element is further reinforced after the changes made by the Federal Constitutional Court and the German legislator to the preventive detention regime applicable to persons such as the applicant. In line with these changes, it is required, in addition, that at the time of the order the persons concerned suffer from a mental disorder, as a result of which they are dangerous to the public."

In view of these strong prospective elements, the Grand Chamber considers that the concept of “nachträgliche Sicherungsverwahrung” is more adequately translated into English by “subsequent preventive detention”, and into French by “ détention de sûreté subséquente ”, thus denominating a measure which is imposed at a later point in time compared to the conviction and which, while having regard to the last conviction of the person concerned, is essentially based on a mental disorder existing at the time when the measure is imposed and rendering the person dangerous.",

The focus of the new overall concept of preventive detention now lay on the individualised medical and therapeutic treatment of the detainees. The statistical material available (see paragraph 91 above) showed that many of the detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered subsequently had been released since the M. v. Germany judgment had become final. It was thus clear that only some of the detainees concerned had been considered as persons of unsound mind and remained in detention and that there could be no question of all the preventive detainees concerned being classified as suffering from a true mental disorder."

The European Prison Litigation Network (EPLN) submitted that the Chamber’s interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1 in the case of Bergmann and in the present application so as to cover persons in preventive detention amounted to depriving these persons of their Convention rights. The interpretation of that term was too broad and imprecise. The EPLN noted that according to the Federal Constitutional Court, the notion of mental disorder under German law also covered non-pathological disorders. However, the term persons of unsound mind, or aliéné in the French text, designated persons who were at least in a severe pathological state and whose capacity for assessing the wrongfulness of their acts was non-existent or at least diminished. Moreover, in order to be convicted, the persons concerned had to have been criminally liable at the time of their offence, which was incompatible with the subsequent finding that these persons were of unsound mind."

Moreover, in determining whether the mental disorder is of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, it is usually necessary to assess the danger a person poses to the public at the time of the order and in the future. In view of these essential prospective elements, the preventive detention ordered against the applicant can best be described as “subsequent” to his previous offence and conviction, despite the fact that in the assessment of his dangerousness regard should also be had to his history of offences, thus embracing a retrospective aspect (see also paragraphs 104-106 above)."

In the EPLN’s view, preventive detention executed in the new preventive detention centres in accordance with the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act still had to be classified as a penalty. It was only applicable to persons convicted of criminal offences. It was ordered by the criminal courts. It was aimed at prolonging the detention after convicted offenders had served their sentence.

To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Del Río Prada, cited above, § 81). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 indicates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien, cited above, § 121; and Bergmann, cited above, § 150) – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may, just as measures which must be classified as a penalty, have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, § 32; Del Río Prada, cited above, § 82; and Bergmann, cited above, § 150)."

These conditions of execution may change during a period of time covered by the same judicial order. Just as in the context of Article 5 § 1, it is then necessary to clarify whether it is the conditions of execution at the time when the measure – such as a person’s detention – was ordered or the conditions of execution during a later period to be assessed by the Court which are relevant for assessing whether the measure in question was a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 § 1."

In that case, the Court had considered that the conditions of the applicant’s preventive detention had substantially changed during the period covered by the same detention order. As shown above (see paragraph 140), while the Court had struck the application out of the list in respect of the alleged breach of Article 7 § 1 following the Government’s unilateral declaration acknowledging a violation of this provision during the time in which Mr W.P. was detained in prison, it found that Mr W.P.’s detention had complied with Article 7 § 1 in the period in which he had been detained in a new preventive detention centre. Accordingly, in the assessment of whether the measure in question, namely Mr W.P.’s preventive detention, was to be classified as a penalty, the Court, as in the context of Article 5 § 1, took into account changes in the conditions of detention occurring during the execution of the measure on the basis of the same detention order."

It notes that some of these criteria can be described as “static” or not susceptible to change after the point in time when the measure was ordered, particularly the criterion whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence” or that of the procedures involved in its making. In contrast, other criteria, including those of the nature and purpose of the measure and of its severity, can be described as “dynamic” or susceptible to change over time.

These applications concerned different preventive detention regimes, which evolved in respect of both their legal basis and their implementation in practice. In accordance with its case-law, the Court had to interpret the notion of penalty in Article 7 § 1 autonomously in these cases, also bearing in mind the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v.

In the case of Glien (cited above, §§ 120-30) it found that the applicant’s preventive detention as enforced in the transitional period between the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 and the application in practice of the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act (see paragraphs 76-80 above), which entered into force on 1 June 2013 and entailed detention under a fresh regime in new preventive detention centres, still constituted a penalty for the purposes of Article 7 § 1.

In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court’s findings concerning the notion of penalty under Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition on the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 74 above). It further found that the provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention as they then stood failed, however, to meet the constitutional requirement of differentiating between purely preventive measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, and penalties, such as prison sentences (see paragraphs 70-72 above).

In that centre, the applicant was being deprived of his liberty under considerably improved material conditions compared to ordinary prison conditions, with a view to differentiating between those two forms of detention, as required by the German Constitution.

The comprehensive therapeutic provision for the applicant, addressing his mental condition, now included, in particular, one-to-one or group social therapy, participation in an intensive treatment programme for sexual offenders and therapy administered by an external psychiatrist. The Court notes that it was only after the period covered by the proceedings here at issue that the applicant accepted a part of the treatment offers made to him (see paragraph 47 above). However, the Court does not have any reason to doubt that the treatment offers made to the applicant were adequate, sufficient and available to the applicant at the relevant time.

However, having regard to the setting in which preventive detention orders are executed under the new regime, the Court is satisfied that the focus of the measure now lies on the medical and therapeutic treatment of the person concerned. The medical and therapeutic provision was central to the specific measures of care provided to the applicant.

                "“The Court reiterates that the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, inter alia, Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 191, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI, and Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 104, ECHR 2013).",
                "... As to the subjective test, the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Morel v. France, no. 34130/96, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 94, ECHR 2009).",
                "... As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Micallef, cited above, § 96).",
                "... It cannot be stated as a general rule resulting from the obligation to be impartial that a superior court which sets aside an administrative or judicial decision is bound to send the case back to a different jurisdictional authority or to a differently composed branch of that authority (see Ringeisen v. Austria, 16 July 1971, § 97, Series A no. 13, and Diennet v. France, 26 September 1995, § 38, Series A no. 325 ‑ A).”",
                "2. Application of these principles to the present case"

                "288. The Court notes that, in its judgment in the present case, the Chamber gave the following reasons for its finding that the applicant had been heard by an impartial tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 in the proceedings at issue (ibid., §§ 124-128):",
                "“As regards the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge P. in the present case, the Court observes that the domestic courts examined the case on the assumption that Judge P. could have made the statement in question ... and it will therefore proceed on the basis of the same assumption. It further notes that Judge P. made the impugned statement in the course of a confidential exchange between the judges of the Regional Court and the applicant’s two defence lawyers. That discussion, which took place just after the Regional Court had delivered its first judgment ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention on 22 June 2009, concerned the applicant’s possible future transfer to a psychiatric hospital. It appears uncontested between the parties, and the Court agrees with that interpretation, that the remark allegedly made by Judge P. within that context to the effect that the applicant’s female counsel should be careful that the applicant would not visit and “thank” her when released was to be understood as meaning that Judge P. considered that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a serious violent or sexual offence against his lawyer (similar to the one he had been found guilty of) if released.",
                "... The Court would stress at the outset the importance of professional conduct in the discharge of judicial functions. In determining whether it was established in view of this alleged remark that Judge P. was personally prejudiced against the applicant (see the above-mentioned “subjective test”), the Court attaches decisive weight to the context in which Judge P.’s statement was made. Assuming, as the national courts did, that he actually made the alleged remark, he did so immediately after the Regional Court, of which he was a member, had ordered the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention as it considered that the applicant was still suffering from violent sexual fantasies and that there was a high risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences, including murder for sexual gratification, if released .... In these circumstances, Judge P.’s alleged remark amounted in substance to a confirmation of the Regional Court’s finding in the judgment it had just delivered. The Court therefore is not persuaded that, even assuming that the remark was made, there is sufficient evidence that Judge P. displayed hostility for personal reasons and was thus personally biased against the applicant.",
                "... The Court shall further examine whether Judge P.’s conduct may prompt objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality from the point of view of an external observer (see the above-mentioned “objective test”). It notes that in the proceedings at issue, the Regional Court, including Judge P., had to take a new decision on whether it was necessary to order the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention after the Federal Constitutional Court had quashed its judgment of 22 June 2009 and remitted the case to the Regional Court.",
                "... The Court, having regard to its case-law ..., considers that the mere fact that Judge P. had already been a member of the bench which had made the first order for the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention and moreover, following the quashing of that judgment, had been a member of the bench ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention anew on 3 August 2012, did not suffice to raise objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality.",
                "... The Court further finds that the fact that Judge P., in his impugned remark, allegedly confirmed that he considered the applicant to be dangerous on 22 June 2009 does not raise objectively justified doubts that the judge lacked impartiality in the proceedings at issue here. In these proceedings, which were terminated some three years after the impugned remark, the Regional Court heard fresh evidence in order to determine whether, at that time and under the law as modified by the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment reversing its previous case-law, the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention had to be ordered. The impugned statement does not give any legitimate reason to fear that Judge P. would not have carried out that necessary fresh assessment of the level of danger that the applicant posed on the basis of the evidence produced and arguments heard in the new proceedings.”"

            [
                "289. The Grand Chamber would stress that assuming that Judge P. actually made the highly inappropriate remark in question, he would have displayed unprofessional behaviour. However, it considers that, for the reasons set out in detail by the Chamber which it endorses, this conduct, in the circumstances of the present case, neither showed that Judge P. was personally biased against the applicant nor that there were objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality in the proceedings at issue."

                "53. The Court observes that she was screened by a nurse on entry to the prison on 7 December 1998. On 8 December 1998 she was seen by Dr K., the prison doctor who set up a course of treatment for her various problems. For the heroin withdrawal symptoms, he initially prescribed a withdrawal drug, Lofexidine. One dose of this drug was omitted at midday due to her low blood pressure. On 10 December 1998 she was seen again by Dr K., who prescribed an intra-muscular injection for the continuing withdrawal symptoms. He found no signs that she was dehydrated and placed more importance on his clinical impressions than her apparent drop in weight from 50 kg to 43 kg since there was known to be a discrepancy between the scales used on admission and those in the health-care centre. He was aware however that there was a potential problem and gave instructions for her weight to be monitored. On 11 December 1998 she was examined again by Dr K., who found no signs of dehydration and considered that her condition was generally stable. He ordered a further injection which was observed to have some effect as she was able to keep down fluids during the rest of the day. Oral doses of the anti-emetic drug were prescribed to continue over the weekend. The nursing notes indicate that on occasion during this period the nurses administered mild anti-nausea medication to assist Judith McGlinchey with her symptoms and were encouraging her to take fluids."

While it appears therefore that Judith McGlinchey’s condition from 7 to 12 December 1998 was subject to regular monitoring, with the medical and nursing staff taking steps to respond to Judith McGlinchey’s withdrawal symptoms, the Court notes that during this period she was vomiting repeatedly, taking very little food and losing considerable weight in an undefined amount. Although injections had been given twice, these had had, at most, a short-term effect and by the evening of 11 December 1998 she was vomiting again. The evidence of any improvement in her condition by this point is, in the Court’s view, slim."

                "55. In the two following days, the weekend, according to the staffing arrangements at the prison, Dr K. was not present. A locum doctor visited the prison on the Saturday morning, 12 December, but the records do not indicate that he saw Judith McGlinchey. If a doctor was required at any other time over the weekend, the nursing staff were expected to call out a doctor or arrange for transfer to hospital. It appears therefore that Judith McGlinchey was not examined by a doctor for two days. On 12 December 1998 her temperature, blood pressure and pulse were observed to be normal. She was however continuing to vomit and her weight was recorded as dropping to 40 kg, a further 3 kg decrease since 9 December and a possible 10 kg decrease since her admission five days earlier. Notwithstanding this further deterioration, the nursing staff did not find any cause for alarm or the need to obtain a doctor’s opinion on her condition."

                "56. The Government have pointed to positive signs over this period – that she slept better during the night and on 13 December took a small meal. However, she vomited on both days and after the meal in question. Dr K. emphasised that, throughout, her vital signs were within the normal range, and that a person suffering serious dehydration would be expected to show lassitude and identifiable physical symptoms which were not present in Judith McGlinchey. However, at the inquest, Dr Tobin considered that, although it had not been established by specific analysis that Judith McGlinchey was dehydrated on entry to hospital due to an inability to insert a central line, there were strong indications to that effect. While the findings could be accounted for by significant blood loss, one episode of coffee-ground vomiting would not provide an adequate explanation."

            [
                "57. The evidence indicates to the Court that by the morning of 14 December 1998 Judith McGlinchey, a heroin addict whose nutritional state and general health were not good on admission to prison, had suffered serious weight loss and was dehydrated. This was the result of a week of largely uncontrolled vomiting symptoms and an inability to eat or hold down fluids. This situation, in addition to causing Judith McGlinchey distress and suffering, posed very serious risks to her health, as shown by her subsequent collapse. Having regard to the responsibility owed by prison authorities to provide the requisite medical care for detained persons, the Court finds that in the present case there was a failure to meet the standards imposed by Article 3 of the Convention. It notes in this context the failure of the prison authorities to provide accurate means of establishing Judith McGlinchey’s weight loss, which was a factor that should have alerted the prison to the seriousness of her condition, but was largely discounted due to the discrepancy of the scales. There was a gap in the monitoring of her condition by a doctor over the weekend when there was a further significant drop in weight and a failure of the prison to take more effective steps to treat Judith McGlinchey’s condition, such as her admission to hospital to ensure the intake of medication and fluids intravenously, or to obtain more expert assistance in controlling the vomiting."

Episodes of severe vomiting could have caused a tear in the upper gastro-intestinal tract (“a Mallory Weiss tear”) though this would most likely have healed by the time she died. This was the most likely cause of haemorrhaging in the stomach which could result in coffee-ground vomiting. If she had lost a substantial amount of blood, rendering her anaemic, this could have triggered the cardiac arrest.

Notwithstanding that antibiotics had been prescribed for her septic arm, it was also indicated that these had not been given to her over a number of days – out of twenty doses that she should have received over five days, she received sixteen.

                "“... for the first day Judith was admitted in the Health Care Centre ... she was then seen by the doctor, [Dr K.], on the second day, on 8 December. He examined her and made a note. She was still retained in the Health Care Centre but as the week proceeded, Judith started to become unwell. You have heard evidence of the fact that she was a heroin abuser and it was known that if she was to withdraw from heroin she might develop some unpleasant symptoms ... those symptoms might manifest themselves for example with diarrhoea and vomiting, possible stomach cramps, depleted sleep patterns and the like and in fact the information that Judith gave to her mother when she first rang rather gave you the impression that she knew that possibly she was to have a rough road ahead but she was prepared to put up with that.",
                "Certainly throughout that week ... it is well-documented that Judith was vomiting profusely. Although she was given medication for that on occasions it only worked for a very short time and it is fair to say that from about midweek onwards she was vomiting at some stage every day. There was also reference to the fact that she had diarrhoea and she was generally unwell.",
                "Her nutritional state may well have been not all that it should have been and although drinks were available for her there was no means of monitoring how much liquid she was taking in. It was not possible to monitor whether she was actually drinking and vomiting it back or not drinking at all. There was no attempt at measuring fluid during the course of that week and her vomiting actually progressed and on some occasions it was described as a lot of vomiting. It was referred to in the notes “vomiting +++” which means rather a lot and although she was seen by nursing staff every day and by the doctor on other occasions the medical staff at New Hall Prison were under the impression all along that Judith was showing no signs of being dehydrated. In other words, she was not being depleted of fluids and [Dr K.] explained in his evidence his findings and the fact that he could see no real evidence that she was dehydrated at the time and felt that even with hindsight there was no necessity for her to be admitted into hospital.",
                "Almost a week after her admission to [prison] on a particular morning when she woke up ... she virtually collapsed in the presence of nursing staff and she vomited a large amount of ... coffee ground vomit ...",

In fact all the doctors who subsequently examined her ... felt that that was not likely to have been the case, although there was certainly a collapse and although she may well have lost a fair amount of blood as a consequence of that. There was no evidence at that particular time that she had experienced a cardiac arrest.",
                "She was taken by ambulance to Pinderfields Hospital ... where she was immediately placed under the care of Dr Tobin ... His working diagnosis at the time was that Judith may well have some degree of liver failure and that there could also be some ... bleeding from the upper gastro-intestinal tract, the oesophagus ... because of the fact that she had vomited the coffee ground vomit.",
                "The evidence of Dr Naomi Carter, the Pathologist ... found some residual material in Judith’s stomach which could well have resembled blood or changed blood but ... was at pains to explain that she could find no source of any bleeding within Judith’s internal organs ... one possible likely cause of the bleed that had produced itself in the coffee ground vomiting was that the retching which she had sustained... might have caused a small tear either in her oesophagus at the point where it reaches the stomach or alternatively in the lining of the stomach itself ... that is a medical condition known as a Mallory Weiss tear but she could not find evidence of that. Her view was that possibly that small tear might well have healed by the time that she saw Judith’s body which was obviously by then some days later. That is the only explanation as to why there was any bleeding ... The significance of that bleed is appropriate because it is highly likely that as a consequence ... Judith will have lost some volume of blood which will have meant that her heart might have had to work harder in order to overcome that and certainly when she was at Pinderfields Hospital she was extremely unwell.",
                "Dr Tobin was of the view that he felt that Judith was in fact dehydrated but he could not prove that specifically because you will recall from Dr Tobin’s evidence that it was not possible for him to insert a central line. Had he been able to do that then it might have been that could have been used as a diagnostic tool ... certainly Dr Tobin was of the opinion that there would seem to be some suggestion that Judith was dehydrated, notwithstanding, according to the medical staff at New Hall, they felt that that was not the case as the week had gone on.",
                "On the morning of 15 December ... unfortunately Judith experienced a cardiac arrest and it was felt that as a consequence of that she had become deprived of oxygen and ... there would have been a deprivation of oxygen to her brain which would have caused her to sustain what was called hypoxic brain damage.",

The post-mortem evidence ... explained the cause of death and Dr Carter was able to confirm that the cause of death was hypoxic brain damage, deprivation of oxygen to the brain, caused by a cardiac arrest which Dr Carter felt was as a consequence of an upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage of an undetermined cause ...”"

Apart from electrolyte disturbance and dehydration, she would be very likely to have had difficulty maintaining an adequate blood sugar level, as she would have had no reserves in the form of stored carbohydrate substances within the body, that could have been utilised, when she was unable to absorb adequate nutrients from her gastrointestinal system due to her persistent vomiting.",

The Court does not find that in the urgency of her immediate transferral to hospital the failure to ensure that Judith McGlinchey was adequately cleaned discloses any element of treatment that could be characterised as degrading. As regards complaints made to her mother that she was having to clean up her own vomit, there is no substantiation of this in the hospital or prison records although one entry refers to Judith McGlinchey refusing to clean her cell.

On 8 December 1998 she was seen by Dr K., the prison doctor who set up a course of treatment for her various problems. For the heroin withdrawal symptoms, he initially prescribed a withdrawal drug, Lofexidine. One dose of this drug was omitted at midday due to her low blood pressure. On 10 December 1998 she was seen again by Dr K., who prescribed an intra-muscular injection for the continuing withdrawal symptoms. He found no signs that she was dehydrated and placed more importance on his clinical impressions than her apparent drop in weight from 50 kg to 43 kg since there was known to be a discrepancy between the scales used on admission and those in the health-care centre. He was aware however that there was a potential problem and gave instructions for her weight to be monitored. On 11 December 1998 she was examined again by Dr K., who found no signs of dehydration and considered that her condition was generally stable. He ordered a further injection which was observed to have some effect as she was able to keep down fluids during the rest of the day. Oral doses of the anti-emetic drug were prescribed to continue over the weekend.

However, at the inquest, Dr Tobin considered that, although it had not been established by specific analysis that Judith McGlinchey was dehydrated on entry to hospital due to an inability to insert a central line, there were strong indications to that effect.

This was the result of a week of largely uncontrolled vomiting symptoms and an inability to eat or hold down fluids. This situation, in addition to causing Judith McGlinchey distress and suffering, posed very serious risks to her health, as shown by her subsequent collapse. Having regard to the responsibility owed by prison authorities to provide the requisite medical care for detained persons, the Court finds that in the present case there was a failure to meet the standards imposed by Article 3 of the Convention. It notes in this context the failure of the prison authorities to provide accurate means of establishing Judith McGlinchey’s weight loss, which was a factor that should have alerted the prison to the seriousness of her condition, but was largely discounted due to the discrepancy of the scales. There was a gap in the monitoring of her condition by a doctor over the weekend when there was a further significant drop in weight and a failure of the prison to take more effective steps to treat Judith McGlinchey’s condition, such as her admission to hospital to ensure the intake of medication and fluids intravenously, or to obtain more expert assistance in controlling the vomiting."

Any cause of action in negligence was dependent on establishing the necessary causal link between the negligent acts and the death and/or personal injury, which was not present in this case.

The applicants had available to them a range of causes of action, including negligence and misfeasance in public office.

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2286, § 95; Aydın v.

The Court has already found, in its decision on admissibility, that no action in negligence could be pursued in the civil courts where the impugned conduct fell short of causing physical or psychological injury. It is not apparent that, in an action for judicial review, which Judith McGlinchey could have brought alleging that the prison had failed in its duty to take reasonable care of her in custody and which could have provided a means of examining the way in which the prison authorities carried out their responsibilities, damages could have been awarded on a different basis. Although the Government argued that this inability to pursue a claim for damages flowed from the facts of the situation and not from any omission in the law, it remains the case that no compensation is available under English law for the suffering and distress which has been found above to disclose a breach of Article 3 of the Convention."

The awards clearly had a practical effect so far as the appellants were concerned and that practical effect was to postpone their release.

The sanction of the loss of early release was not only a necessary and effective incentive, but it was a common sanction of prison disciplinary regimes in many Council of Europe member States. Indeed, it was a sanction which did not appear on a prisoner's criminal record (as noted in Engel and Others, pp. 33-34, § 80)."

As to the changes to the prison disciplinary regime of England and Wales introduced since the Chamber's judgment, the Government argued that the Grand Chamber's judgment should not depend on whether or not England and Wales had found an adequate disciplinary response to the Chamber's judgment. In any event, they maintained their position that the imposition of additional days was an essential part of the maintenance of discipline in prisons and of the authority of the prison management. The new procedure was not as effective as the old and was regarded as “second best”. The Government provided the following reasons.",
                "In the first place, the new system involved greater delays. A governor had to examine a disciplinary charge the day after it had been laid whereas an adjudicator was required to examine a charge not later than 28 days after it had been laid. Adjournments before a governor delayed matters a number of days but those before an adjudicator involved delays of weeks, a factor compounded by the requirement for legal representation. Adjudicators had already complained to the Government that the system was unwieldy and that adjournments were frequently sought. Such delays undermined the faith in the system of victims of offending behaviour and weakened the deterrent value of the system. Delay also meant that in the days running up to early release a prisoner could regard him or herself as immune from an adjudicator's award of additional days, leading to a difference in treatment between those at the earlier and later stages of their sentences.",
                "Secondly, the system was administratively more cumbersome in that it required notification of the Lord Chancellor's Department of the need for an adjudicator and that department's identification of an adjudicator free to hear the case. Suitable facilities in prison were required for the hearing, the judge and the solicitors, and additional escorting requirements took prison officers away from their normal duties.",
                "Thirdly, the added administrative costs to the Prison Service of the new system directed funds away from other more pressing concerns. Since the number of cases to be referred to adjudicators had therefore to be significantly reduced, the new system had effectively removed the availability in many cases of the penalty of additional days.",
                "Fourthly, the added costs and reduced effectiveness of the new prison disciplinary system would increase the incentive to revert to a completely discretionary based remission system, the revocation of which had led to the Chamber's conclusion as to the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government maintained that the Chamber's judgment effectively penalised a State for structuring its remission system with a view to enhancing its incentive objective, thus undermining the legitimate policy objectives of an effective prison disciplinary system. In this connection, the Government argued that the Chamber's approach placed too much emphasis on how the State organised its disciplinary and remission systems, so that a State could avoid the application of Article 6 by cleverly reorganising those systems, a result which would be contrary to the autonomous requirements of Article 6, which are meant to have a uniform application throughout the States. The best approach would be to recognise that both discretionary and structured systems of remission and awards of additional days had the same effect in substance upon a prisoner and then to apply a common approach to all in assessing the width of the disciplinary sphere in a prison context."

Indeed, of the countries reviewed by Dr Loucks, Scotland was the only one that no longer retained the possibility of sanctioning misconduct by loss of early release or remission.

The Court was careful in the Engel and Others judgment to state that, as regards the dividing line between the'criminal'and the'disciplinary', it was confining its attention to the sphere with which the case was concerned, namely military service. It is well aware that in the prison context there are practical reasons and reasons of policy for establishing a special disciplinary regime, for example security considerations and the interests of public order, the need to deal with misconduct by inmates as expeditiously as possible, the availability of tailor-made sanctions which may not be at the disposal of the ordinary courts and the desire of the prison authorities to retain ultimate responsibility for discipline within their establishments.",

It therefore has to be determined whether the proceedings against Mr Campbell have to be regarded as coming within the'criminal'sphere for Convention purposes.

As in Campbell and Fell, the Court does not question the importance of preserving an effective system of order and control in prison. However, it does not find compelling the Government's argument that the loss by the governor of the power to award “additional days” would undermine the prison disciplinary regime in England and Wales.",

The Court considers that it has not been convincingly explained why these other sanctions would not have an impact comparable to awards of additional days in maintaining the effectiveness of the prison disciplinary system, including the authority of the prison management. In this regard, the Government did not address how a sanction with immediate application would be less effective than an award of additional days, which is not served until a prisoner's early release date (set pursuant to section 33 of the 1991 Act) and which in many cases will be therefore served some time, even years, after the adjudication hearing. Further, the Court does not consider that the Government have convincingly demonstrated significant material differences between the disciplinary needs in Scottish prisons, where use of additional days was suspended almost two years ago, and those needs in prisons in England and Wales.",

The fact that the Government responded to the Chamber's judgment by making certain domestic changes cannot be determinative of the contested issue of applicability still before this Court.",

In Campbell and Fell ( p. 35, § 69 – and see paragraph 83 above), the Court accepted that there might be practical reasons and reasons of policy for establishing a special prison disciplinary system, but emphasised that, in appropriate cases, there was no warrant for depriving prisoners of the safeguards of Article 6 of the Convention.

While certain offences are characteristic of a disciplinary system as their very existence depends on the status of the person as a prisoner, other charges are “mixed” in that they belong simultaneously to the criminal and disciplinary spheres, which factor tends strongly in favour of treating those charges as criminal for the purpose of Article 6. In this latter respect, the applicants reminded the Court that the offences with which they were charged were of a general character; the elements of the offences were precisely the same as those of the equivalent criminal offences; the conduct alleged could have been the subject of criminal prosecution outside the prison; the proceedings were adversarial in character; the burden and standard of proof adopted in disciplinary proceedings were the same as in a criminal court; and the penalties imposed were both punitive and preventative in nature, purpose and effect.",

In Campbell and Fell, the Court emphasised that it was the especially grave nature of the offences at issue which led it to the conclusion that the offences in that case had a “certain colouring” which did not coincide with that of a purely disciplinary offence. The Government considered that the Chamber did not sufficiently take account of the fact that the offences at issue in the present case were not at all of the same order of seriousness as the offences at issue in Campbell and Fell."

Thirdly, while the Government accepted that it was relevant to consider whether the offence gave rise, at least in theory, to concurrent disciplinary and criminal liability, they pointed out that it was inevitable that there would be an overlap between offences forming part of prison disciplinary and criminal regimes, given that the objective of both was to seek to maintain reasonable and acceptable standards of behaviour. Accordingly, such an overlap was just one factor to be taken into account in the overall assessment of the nature of the charge, but such an overlap should not obscure the fact that the offences under a prison disciplinary code generally had a predominantly disciplinary character. The Chamber accorded, in the Government's opinion, far too much weight to this concurrent liability issue. In Engel itself, although the offences were considered “mixed”, the Court held that the State was in principle entitled to employ the disciplinary rather than the criminal law as the impugned acts were in contravention of “legal rule[s] governing the operation of the armed forces” ( see Engel and Others, pp. 34-35, § 82)."

Fourthly, the Government accepted that the Court's case-law provided that a charge's punitive purpose was indicative of its criminal nature and that the purpose of disciplinary sanctions under the Prison Rules was to some extent punitive. However, that was not their primary purpose. Maintaining a defined set of offences against discipline with the imposition (and, as appropriate, remitting) of sanctions was but an aspect of the successful operation of the early release system: the possibility of early release gave prisoners an incentive to behave well, but it was correspondingly necessary that a prisoner should lose early release for bad behaviour. The primary purpose of the prison disciplinary system was therefore “preventative”. Indeed, the predominant significance of the applicants'conduct was that it had a tendency to undermine the good management of the prison and the authority of prison officers. There was “no real prospect” that the first applicant would have carried out the threat against the probation officer and the assault of which the second applicant was found guilty was minor. However, it would have been inimical to the maintenance of good order in prison if they had been allowed to carry out such acts with impunity and had these acts gone unpunished."

It is also clear that the charge of assault against the second applicant is an offence under the criminal law as well as under the Prison Rules. It is true that the latter charge involved a relatively minor incident of deliberately colliding with a prison officer, which may not necessarily have led to prosecution outside the prison context. It is also true that the extreme gravity of the offence may be indicative of its criminal nature, as indicated in Campbell and Fell (see paragraph 101 above). However, that does not conversely mean that the minor nature of an offence can, of itself, take it outside the ambit of Article 6, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the second of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness ( see Öztürk, cited above, pp. 20-21, § 53).

Accordingly, and even noting the prison context of the charges, the theoretical possibility of concurrent criminal and disciplinary liability is, at the very least, a relevant point which tends to the classification of the nature of both offences as “mixed” offences."

It does not find persuasive the Government's argument distinguishing between the punishment and deterrent aims of the offences in question, these objectives not being mutually exclusive ( see Öztürk, cited above, pp. 20-21, § 53) and being recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (see paragraph 102 above)."

Accordingly, no direct comparison was possible with the situation of a person at liberty or even that of military personnel (at issue in Engel and Others ), the latter personnel being otherwise at liberty, albeit subject to a code of military discipline.

The courts considered that, if remission was not a legal “right”, prisoners had at least a legitimate expectation of release on the expiry of the relevant period (see paragraph 42 above). In Campbell and Fell ( pp. 37-38, § 72), the Court accepted that the practice of granting remission, as it existed at that time, was such that it created in the prisoner a legitimate expectation that he or she would recover his or her liberty before the end of the term of imprisonment and that forfeiture of remission had the effect of causing the detention to continue beyond the period corresponding to that expectation.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

The applicant firstly complained about the fairness of the disciplinary proceedings conducted against him in Lepoglava State Prison. He alleged in particular that the time-limit for an appeal against the prison authorities'decision imposing disciplinary sanctions on him, being forty-eight hours only, had been too short, and further that the Varaždin County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences had erred in his reasoning that a time-limit fixed in hours and expiring on a Sunday did not have to be extended until the first working day. The applicant also complained that in the disciplinary proceedings conducted against him by the Gospić Prison authorities for the alleged possession of illegal drugs, he had not attended the final hearing because his defence lawyer had not been present. The notes on the hearing had not been served on him. The applicant complained that although he had raised the same issues in his appeal against the prison authorities'decision of 2 November 2004 imposing a disciplinary sanction on him, the Gospić County Court judge's decision of 18 November 2004 had not made any reference to these complaints.",

As regards the sanctions prescribed, they were purely disciplinary in nature.

However, in the present case the legal basis for the applicant's deprivation of liberty was his original conviction for criminal offences. Although the disciplinary sanction added a new element – imposition of seven days'solitary confinement – it did not in any way extend the applicant's prison term. Furthermore, the seriousness of the sanction was lessened by its conditional character.

However, according to the Court's case law, the indications so afforded by the national law have only relative value; the very nature of the offence is a factor of greater importance (see Campbell and Fell, cited above, p. 36, § 71)."

The Court's case law affirms that it has to be borne in mind that misconduct by a prisoner may take different forms; certain acts are clearly no more than a question of internal discipline, whereas others cannot be seen in the same light. Firstly, some matters may be more serious than others. Secondly, the illegality of some acts may not turn on the fact that they were committed in prison: certain conduct which constitutes a disciplinary offence may also amount to an offence under the criminal law. In the circumstance of the present case, it corresponds to a crime of drug abuse under Article 173 of the Croatian Penal Code which comprises also mere possession of the illegal drugs."

However, the fact that the offence in question could have been the subject of both criminal and prison disciplinary proceedings does not suffice for the Court to conclude that Article 6 is applicable to these proceedings. In this respect the Court notes that the national authorities did not institute any criminal proceedings against the applicant, but opted for disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, it is necessary to turn to the third criterion: the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Engel and Others, cited above, pp. 34-35, § 82)."

The Court stresses the importance of preserving an effective system of order and control in prison. The sanction imposed on the applicant for a very serious breach of prison discipline did not extend the applicant's prison term (see, a contrario, Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003 ‑ X), nor did it seriously aggravate the terms of the applicant's prison conditions.

The reason for that punishment, as confirmed by the Gospić County Court, was the fact that the applicant had attempted to smuggle illegal drugs into the prison in breach of section 145 ( 3 ) (11) of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act.

An inmate punished with any of the disciplinary sanctions is able to lodge a complaint with a judge responsible for the execution of sentences and to appeal the judge's decision. The Act was published in the Official Gazette. Therefore, the Court is satisfied that the domestic law at issue in the present case was drafted with sufficient clarity and precision so as to satisfy the requirement of being foreseeable, and was furthermore accessible and appealable to a court.

In judgments nos. 349 and 410 of 1993, it held that section 41 bis was compatible with the Constitution. It observed that while the special prison regime within the meaning of the provision in question was in practice laid down by the Minister, an appeal lay against a ministerial decree to the courts responsible for the execution of sentences, which had the power to review both the need for such a measure and the actual measures to be applied to the prisoner concerned, which in any event ought never to entail inhuman treatment.",

As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners ’ correspondence. Accordingly, from the end of 1993 the sole basis for monitoring of correspondence was section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975, as amended by section 1 of Law no. 1 of 1977.",

In practice, monitoring means interception of all a prisoner ’ s correspondence, which is then read by the judicial authority which ordered it, by the governor of the prison or by prison staff designated by the governor. The letters are then stamped to show that they have been inspected. The deletion of words or sentences is not permitted, but the judicial authority may order that one or more letters should not be delivered, in which case the prisoner must be informed immediately.

With particular reference to persons deprived of their liberty, Article 3 imposes a positive obligation on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Rivière v. France, no. 33834/03, § 62, 11 July 2006 ). Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 87, ECHR 2000-VII, and Naumenko, cited above, § 112 )."

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat ( see Mouisel, cited above, § 40 ), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well ‑ being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, § 76, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 38, 15 January 2004 )."

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, § 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a) the prisoner ’ s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, § 53, 2 December 2004, and Sakkopoulos, cited above, § 39).",

On three occasions, in January 2001 and in March and July 2002, the Naples court responsible for the execution of sentences, on the basis of the medical reports drawn up by the prison doctors, refused the applicant ’ s requests for a stay of execution of his sentence, taking the view that the care provided by the prison ’ s in-house medical service was appropriate to his state of health (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Argenti v.

The Court arrived at this conclusion by taking account of two factors in particular, namely the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime and the fact that the Minister of Justice could issue a new decree without being bound by any decision the court responsible for the execution of sentences might have taken to rescind all or part of the restrictions imposed by the previous decree.

In that context the Court considers that, given the specific nature of the phenomenon of organised crime, particularly of the mafia type, and the fact that family visits have frequently served as a means of conveying orders and instructions to the outside, the – admittedly substantial – restrictions on visits, and the accompanying controls, could not be said to be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see Salvatore v.

                "76. However, the Court notes that the situation does not appear to have been one of solitary confinement imposed as a sanction resulting from a disciplinary measure. The Government submitted that the decision to house the applicant in Division 6 had been for security purposes, presumably as a result of concerns following the incident of 12 July 2013. Nevertheless, the Court takes issue with the way in which this decision was taken, particularly the fact that the decision and the details pertaining to it were not made known to the applicant. The result was that he could not have taken any action in this respect, such as an appeal, even if this had been at all available. The Court notes that the CPT also raised concerns regarding such procedures whereby detainees are involuntarily separated from other inmates for security or disciplinary reasons (alongside the formal disciplinary procedures) and called for effective safeguards. Similar concerns were raised by the CPT concerning “removal from association” and placement in Division 5 which were part of the formal discipline and good order procedure of the facility. Furthermore, in their previous report of 2011, also referred to in 2016 (see paragraph 27 above), they had raised “concerns about the existence of an informal punishment system in the so ‑ called ‘ high ‑ security unit ’ of Division 6”."

While he claimed to have been unable to use the communal areas, the Government made no specific submission on this point and it is unclear whether this also formed part of the unpublished decision. No further details have been submitted by the applicant concerning other restrictions applicable in Division 6 and no detail whatsoever has been submitted concerning restrictions in Division 5, where the applicant spent nearly three months. It follows that, while similar situations ‑ specifically decisions on punishment or security measures ‑ certainly call for an appropriate framework, which would also dispel any discrimination concerns, in the light of the Court ’ s case-law referred to in paragraph 75 above, from the material available to it the Court cannot find that the situation the applicant endured during that period raises issues within the ambit of Article 3."

The report described the applicant as being “edgy and hyper-vigilant but not psychotic”, his sleep was not problematic, his appetite was normal and he was cooperative.

The yards were extremely hot, and at the time of the visit, the delegation noted that not a single prisoner made use of them during the day.",
                "By letter dated 4 November 2015, the Maltese authorities informed the Committee that renovations of Divisions II and III were envisaged and would be completed by the end of 2017.",
                "Further, the authorities planned to connect each division to the main water supply and to install two taps in each division to enable inmates to access drinking water.",
                "58. The CPT welcomes these initiatives. Nevertheless, the CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities take the necessary steps to improve the living conditions at CCF and, in particular, to:",
                "reduce the occupancy levels in multi-occupancy dormitories to ensure that each prisoner has at least 4m² of living space;",
                "undertake a systematic refurbishment of the cells and sanitary facilities in Division XIII;",

                "59. As regards the regime of activities on offer, the aim should be for all inmates to spend a large part of the day engaged in purposeful activities of a varied nature. At the time of the visit, the activities on offer included access to the gym and football ground, educational courses on music, information technology and languages, technical courses on stone masonry and carpentry and lifeskills programmes including on positive parenting and first aid. Work was also on offer to prisoners, mainly in the form of toy doll construction. The CPT ’ s delegation welcomed the fact that more than 80% of all the inmates had access to some kind of work or education; the situation in this respect had improved since the 2011 visit.",
                "65. The CPT ’ s delegation noted that all newly-arrived prisoners in general were given, as soon as possible, and no later than 24 hours after their admission, a comprehensive medical examination by a health-care professional.",
                "In respect of health-care staffing at CCF, there were three General Practitioners (GPs) on contract with the prison, who provided a clinic onsite from Mondays to Fridays, from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. Two of these GPs also provided on-call services overnight and at weekends. Five or six nurses were on duty every day, from 7 a.m. to 8.30 p.m., and one nurse attended to the administration of methadone between 7 a.m. and midday every day, including weekends. A psychiatric clinic was held on Mondays and Fridays with the services of two consultant psychiatrists, who were supported by a staff-grade psychiatrist. Now, inmate patients wishing to see the psychiatrist had to be first referred by the GP. A dentist visited CCF every Tuesday and Wednesday (and a dental hygienist visited on Thursdays) and examined 12 to 15 patients every week. There was also a pharmacist, who attended CCF from Mondays to Fridays between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.",
                "67. The CPT ’ s delegation had some serious concerns about the co-ordination of health-care services and the guarantee of medical confidentiality at CCF. At the time of the visit, two experienced (and committed) prison officers were responsible for co ‑ ordinating the activities of the health-care service. They were also responsible for ensuring the security as part of their ordinary role as prison officers and the administration of hospital appointments. In the delegation ’ s view, the management was over-relying on prison officers to co-ordinate and manage health-care services at CCF. Further, these officers had ready access to the medical records and indeed were responsible for the filing of correspondence. In this respect, medical confidentiality was not guaranteed.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities take steps to:",
                "ensure that medical confidentiality is strictly guaranteed and that prison officers do not have access to medical records; and",
                "review the co-ordination of health-care by prison officers at CCF and, in this respect, it invites the authorities to consider the possibility of recruiting a fulltime health-care staff member to oversee co-ordination and management of the health ‑ care services provided at CCF.",
                "68. The delegation was also concerned about the management of medicines and the procedure and manner in which medicines were distributed to inmates at CCF. Staff interviewed by the delegation also raised several concerns in this respect.",
                "For instance, psychiatric medicines were mixed together and dissolved in a cup of water, every morning, and issued to inmates either once, twice or three times later that same day. Such an arrangement takes no account of the pharmaco ‑ kinetics of the individual drug, its bioavailability or any potential interactions with other psychiatric drugs. The pharmacist explained that sometimes such a mixture might be green in colour and at other times the same drugs are pink in colour. This concern was also raised by some inmates in subsequent interviews with the delegation.",
                "69. The delegation also observed that medicines were removed by nursing staff from their original packets and put into open containers, whose labels did not include any expiry date. The containers were simply topped up by the nursing staff as stocks dwindled, with the result that the expiry dates of individual tablets within these containers were not known at the time that they were administered. If a particular stock ran low, then it was likely that tablets taken from the bottom of the container would have passed their expiry date. Moreover, in making up the medicines for inmates, the nursing staff took a number of pills from the open containers and placed them in a tub which had the inmate ’ s name on the lid only. In essence, this meant that if the wrong lid was put on the wrong tub, an inmate would get the incorrect medication.",
                "70. (...) In addition, while prescriptions were annotated by doctors, there was often no review date of prescriptions with the result that it was unclear, in many cases, how long the medicines should be continued to be administered. Overall, the current administration of medication at CCF, and particularly the administration of psychotropic medication, was unsafe.",
                "The CPT recommends that the authorities review the current practices around the management of medicines at CCF in light of the above remarks, and ensure that unsafe practices around the administration of psychotropic medication cease.",
                "71. By letter dated 4 November 2015, the Maltese authorities informed the Committee that a review of the health-care system at CCF was being undertaken, in order to terminate the current contractual system. The employment of full-time medical staff was also under consideration. The CPT welcomes the review and would like to receive a copy of the review report and recommendations.",
                "b. self-harm and suicide prevention",
                "72. The delegation observed that there was no strategy in place regarding the management of those thought to be at risk of self-harm. For instance, there were no clear guidelines available to health-care staff on how to address incidences of food refusal.",
                "73. The CPT ’ s delegation noted that cases of self-harm and attempted suicide were not systematically recorded at CCF and there was no specific self-harm or trauma register. One of the reasons for this, according to staff interviewed, was that ordinarily at-risk prisoners were transferred from CCF to the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital, where they usually remained for a few days. While the fact of the transfer was recorded, only in very few of these cases was any reference made to the risk of self-harm/ suicide attempts. It was more common to simply find the word “confused” written in the records. Moreover, there were no hand-over or follow-up procedures concerning those prisoners who returned to CCF from the psychiatric forensic units in Mount Carmel Hospital. Thus, appropriate handover and follow-up procedures should be established at CCF for returning prisoners from the psychiatric forensic units at Mount Carmel.",
                "74. As regards suicide prevention policies, it is clear that CCF needs to put in place procedures for the identification of prisoners who may be at risk of suicide or self ‑ harm and draw up a protocol for the management of prisoners identified as presenting a risk. To begin with, medical screening on arrival, and the reception process as a whole, has an important role to play in suicide prevention; performed properly, it should assist in identifying those at risk and relieve some of the anxiety experienced by all newly-arrived prisoners. The screening process should include a suicide risk assessment using an identified screening tool.",
                "Moreover, it is essential that the prevention of suicide, including the identification of those at risk, should not rest with the health-care service alone. All prison staff coming into contact with inmates – and, as a priority, staff who work in the reception and admissions units – should be trained in recognising indications of suicidal risk. The sharing of information concerning suicidal tendencies with prison staff can be considered as an ethical necessity in light of the possible consequences that inaction may entail. In this connection, it should be noted that the periods immediately following admission to prison as well as before and after trial and, in some cases, the pre-release period, are associated with an increased risk of suicide.",
                "Upon identification of prisoners potentially at risk, steps should be taken to ensure a proper flow of information within the establishment. All persons identified as presenting a suicide risk should as a first step benefit from appropriate support and association. Further, if required, such persons should be subject to special precautions (placement in a ligature-free room and provision of suicide-proof clothing) and, where there is a high risk of suicide, the prisoner should be under constant observation by a member of staff who should engage in a dialogue with the prisoner. The need for enhanced contacts (i.e. family visits and telephone calls) should be individually assessed.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities ensure that a comprehensive suicide prevention and management approach is introduced at CCF, taking into account the above remarks.",
                "b. disciplinary procedures, segregation and solitary confinement",
                "80. It is in the interests of both inmates and prison staff that clear disciplinary procedures be both formally established and applied in practice; any grey zones in this area involve the risk of unofficial (and uncontrolled) systems developing. Disciplinary procedures should provide prisoners with a right to be heard on the subject of the offences that they allegedly had committed, and to appeal to a higher authority against any sanctions imposed.",
                "Further, if other procedures exist ‑ alongside the formal disciplinary procedure ‑ under which an inmate may be involuntarily separated from other inmates for discipline-related/security reasons (e.g. in the interests of good order within an establishment), these procedures should also be accompanied by effective safeguards.",
                "81. As regards the disciplinary procedures at CCF, according to the law an inmate found guilty of a disciplinary offence may undergo the following punishments: caution; forfeiture or postponement for any period of any of the privileges; exclusion from associated work for a period not exceeding fifty-six days; cellular confinement not exceeding thirty days; or forfeiture of not more than one hundred and twenty days of remission.",
                "87. The CPT ’ s delegation noted that ‘ problematic ‘ prisoners placed on Divisions V and XIII were subjected to a particularly restrictive regime compared with other prisoners. On both divisions, the inmates had little to do and were locked in the divisions for long periods of the day, save for a couple of hours when they were allowed to exercise in the divisions ’ exercise yards. The vast majority of these inmates (including all those on Division XIII) had no access to education, activities, work or regular religious worship; all those interviewed by the delegation complained about the lack of any purposeful activities. Moreover, on Division V, some inmates had even resorted to hunger strikes in order to be allowed to attend the prison church. The restrictive regimes on Divisions V and XIII applied to all inmates, regardless of their classification, and included some life-sentenced prisoners.",
                "By letter dated 4 November 2015, the Maltese authorities informed the Committee that a limited education service would be introduced on Division V and that work opportunities in maintenance would be offered to a greater number of inmates on Division V. The CPT welcomes these initiatives. It would like to receive confirmation from the authorities when these measures have been introduced.",
                "The CPT recommends that inmates on Division XIII be provided with access to a full range of education services, work opportunities, access to a place of worship and sports and recreational activities. It also encourages the authorities to further expand the opportunities available to prisoners on Division V.",
                "Further, it would like to receive information on the number of inmates in Division V who attend education and are involved in work, and for how many hours per day such activities are performed.",
                "88. Removal from association and placement on Division V was part of the formal discipline and good order procedure of CCF. In contrast, the placement procedure and the safeguards surrounding placement on Division XIII, which resulted in a restrictive regime for the inmate concerned, were opaque and little understood by the inmates. Inmates did not know why they had been placed on such a division, or for how long they would be accommodated there. Inmates were also unaware of any avenues to appeal or challenge the placement decision. Moreover, some inmates were placed there immediately upon arrival due to the lack of a formal induction procedure or area at CCF as well as due to the lack of other available accommodation on any other division. In the delegation ’ s view, placement on Division XIII was treated by the staff as an informal punishment, and was perceived as such by the inmates.",
                "Similar concerns about the existence of an informal punishment system on the so ‑ called “high-security unit” of Division VI had been raised by the CPT in 2011.",
                "At the time of the 2015 visit, staff acknowledged that the same type of inmate, who had previously been placed on Division VI, was now being placed on Division XIII. Further, the delegation noted that the Prison Regulations had still not been amended to provide a remedy against the placement decision entailing segregation from the mainstream prison population.",
                "89. In the CPT ’ s view, placement on a restricted regime or in special security conditions should be based on an individualised assessment of the actual risks, and the prisoner concerned should as far as possible be kept fully informed of the reasons for the measure in writing. In addition, the prisoners concerned should be entitled to appeal the decision on placement, or its renewal, to an independent authority.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities amend the Prison Regulations to ensure that, in particular:",
                "placement on a restricted regime or in special security conditions should be based on an individualised assessment of the actual risks;",
                "the prisoner concerned should as far as possible be kept fully informed of the reasons for the measure in writing; and",
                "the prisoner concerned should be entitled to appeal the decision on placement, or its renewal, to an independent authority.",
                "90. As regards solitary and cellular confinement for discipline purposes, section 68 of the Prison Regulations stipulates that ‘ the Director may order a violent prisoner to be confined temporarily in an appropriate cell [and] if the Director keeps such order in force for more than forty-eight hours he shall consult the Medical Officer and shall inform the Chairman of the Board ’.",
                "In CCF, solitary confinement on account of violence was resorted to in one of three adjoining cells, built in 2000 and designated as single rooms used for medical and disciplinary isolation purposes, situated next to the Infirmary. Each of the three cells had a bed plinth with a mattress and a toilet annexe. The cells had access to natural light and adequate ventilation and each had a call-bell. From examination of the relevant registers and interviews with prisoners and staff, it was clear that these cells were only occasionally used.",
                "Of the nine placements from January 2015 until the date of the CPT delegation ’ s visit, seven had been for medical observation reasons and two for disciplinary purposes. The disciplinary cases had both involved the same person and each had lasted less than 48 hours. The seven medical cases had lasted seven, four, seven, five, two, one and three days respectively.",
                "As regards the sanction of cellular confinement for up to a period of 30 days, the CPT understands that this measure means that the inmate is kept in his or her cell. Therefore, in most cases in CCF (given that most of the prisoners have single-cell accommodation) this measure means being placed in effective solitary confinement for 30 days.",
                "The CPT recalls that solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should not last for a period of more than 14 days consecutively. Thus, it recommends that the Prison Regulations be amended to reflect this.”"

            [
                "28. In their earlier report, published on 4 July 2013, the CPT had already commented on Division 6, recommending that occupancy levels be reduced and access to natural light and artificial lighting be improved. It was also recommended that Divisions 2 and 3 be renovated as a priority (see Story and Others, cited above, § 61). That report had also stated:",
                "“15. Material conditions were quite simply appalling in Division 6, where most of the cells, intended to be used for single occupancy only, were accommodating two inmates. There was hardly any access to natural light, and access to both artificial lighting and ventilation were poor. The cells were only equipped with one bed and another mattress, placed on the floor (and a blanket for each inmate), and an unpartitioned floor toilet. In addition, the toilet flush did not work in some of the cells.",
                "17. In Divisions 2 and 3, material conditions were also far below any acceptable standard. Cells were in a very poor state of repair and had only very limited access to natural light. Another major problem was the high level of humidity in many cells, caused by water leaking from the ceiling. In this regard, cell no. 51 in Division 2 (which also had no window) and cell no. 114 in Division 3 were particularly affected. The latter cell was extremely dilapidated and so humid (with water running down the walls) that the prisoner could not keep any personal belongings in his cell. Moreover, in many cells, the toilet flush was not functioning, and, in particular in Division 3, most of the shower facilities (including the sinks) were broken.",
                "18. Division 5 and the so-called “New Infirmary” were found in the same dilapidated conditions as in 2008. In addition, many cells were very small and access to natural light very limited.",
                "22. The criteria for placement of prisoners in the so-called “high-security unit” (Division 6) appeared to be particularly unclear. ... Also in other cases it was not uncommon for prisoners to be transferred to Division 6 by verbal order of the Director without an individual risk assessment. Moreover, the current legislation does not provide for a legal remedy against the segregation of prisoners from the mainstream prison population (“removal from association”).",
                "In the CPT ’ s view, placement in special security conditions should be based on an individualised assessment of the actual risks, and the prisoner concerned should as far as possible be kept fully informed of the reasons for the measure in writing. In addition, the prisoners concerned should be entitled to appeal the decision on placement, or its renewal, to an independent authority.",

However, they had been unable to do so in respect of the three applicants, in respect of whom the Court concluded that they had become untraceable, or in any event that there had been severance of contact between the mentioned three applicants and their representatives. In the light of those facts the Court found that those three applicants did not intend to pursue their applications. Also bearing in mind that their complaints were identical to the ones brought by the other ninety ‑ nine applicants, the Court considered that there were no special circumstances regarding respect for human rights as defined in the Convention or its Protocols which required the continuation of the examination of the application in respect of those three applicants, and proceeded to strike out their applications (ibid, §§ 40 ‑ 45)."

Latvia, no. 798/05, §§ 62 and 65, 15 September 2009). However, the rejection of an application on grounds of abuse of the right of application is an exceptional measure (see Miroļubovs and Others, cited above, § 62) and has so far been applied only in a limited number of cases. In particular, the Court has rejected applications as abusive under Article 35 § 3 of the Convention if they were knowingly based on untrue facts or misleading information (see Gross v.

The Court is mindful of the fact that – if there is no effective domestic remedy to be exhausted – a complaint about conditions of detention must be lodged within six months of the end of the situation complained of. The Court ’ s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant ’ s detention may be summarised in the following manner: the period of an applicant ’ s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. The applicant ’ s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation” (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 78, 10 January 2012)."

However, from the Government ’ s submissions it appears that Division 5 was also a secure division, although it had less strict restrictions. It can therefore be said that – unlike Division 3, which is a regular division – Divisions 5 and 6 are both high ‑ security divisions in the same establishment, and can thus be considered as being the “same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions” and the situation can therefore be regarded as a “continuing” one. It follows that, given that the applicant lodged his application on 1 April 2014, the complaint – in so far as it concerns the period of detention in Divisions 5 and 6, which came to an end on 22 October 2013 – is in conformity with the application of the six-month rule, as is the period subsequently spent in Division 3."

Furthermore, the Court notes that one of the pictures submitted by the Government to prove the availability of running water in cell 8, in fact does not show any running water. Nevertheless, the Court is prepared to accept that this is the result of an error, or in any event represented a temporary interruption which did not persist in the long run. The most recent CPT report (see paragraph 27 above) confirmed that running water was cut off intermittently.

The Court notes that the photographs submitted by the Government concerning the cell at issue only show its state after repair work had been carried out by the current detainee – which goes to show that the cell needed restoration, but reiterates that it does not find it demeaning for the detainees to be encouraged to paint their cells, with paint provided by the authorities (ibid, § 125).

The Court notes that sometime after the applicant left Division 6, and prior to the CPT visit in 2015, Division 6 was indeed closed down. In their 2011 report (see paragraph 28 above) the CPT, which described the situation in Division 6 as appalling, had commented that the artificial lighting was poor. However, no mention was made of a total lack of electricity.

Lastly, as it did in Story and Others, in examining the cumulative effect of the factors complained of, the Court cannot but take account of the fact that cells were unlocked at 7.30 a.m. and left open until 12.30 p.m.; they were unlocked again at 2 p.m. and locked at 8.30 p.m. As to the time spent in Division 5 and 6, details concerning the matter have not been submitted by the parties but the Court notes that even in Division 6 ‑ the highest security division – the applicant ’ s cell was left open for seven hours a day, and according to the CPT report, in Division 5 (at the time of the visit Division 6 had been closed down) where prisoners were subjected to a particularly restrictive regime, they were nonetheless allowed a couple of hours a day in the exercise yard (see paragraph 27 above). The applicant was therefore free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for several hours a day, depending on the Division. Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicant ’ s conditions of detention. To that must be added the fact that, even when in the cell, the applicant was not exposed to extreme conditions, since in the relevant period he was always held in a cell measuring around 9 sq.m, with an individual sleeping place and the usual items of equipment."

Denmark, no. 69332/01, § 93, 21 July 2005). In that connection the length of the period in question requires careful examination by the Court as to its justification, the need for the measures taken and their proportionality with regard to other possible restrictions, the guarantees offered to the applicant to avoid arbitrariness and the measures taken by the authorities to satisfy themselves that the applicant ’ s physical and psychological condition allowed him to remain in isolation (see Ramirez Sanchez v.

The Government submitted that the decision to house the applicant in Division 6 had been for security purposes, presumably as a result of concerns following the incident of 12 July 2013. Nevertheless, the Court takes issue with the way in which this decision was taken, particularly the fact that the decision and the details pertaining to it were not made known to the applicant. The result was that he could not have taken any action in this respect, such as an appeal, even if this had been at all available. The Court notes that the CPT also raised concerns regarding such procedures whereby detainees are involuntarily separated from other inmates for security or disciplinary reasons (alongside the formal disciplinary procedures) and called for effective safeguards. Similar concerns were raised by the CPT concerning “removal from association” and placement in Division 5 which were part of the formal discipline and good order procedure of the facility. Furthermore, in their previous report of 2011, also referred to in 2016 (see paragraph 27 above), they had raised “concerns about the existence of an informal punishment system in the so ‑ called ‘ high ‑ security unit ’ of Division 6”."

While he claimed to have been unable to use the communal areas, the Government made no specific submission on this point and it is unclear whether this also formed part of the unpublished decision. No further details have been submitted by the applicant concerning other restrictions applicable in Division 6 and no detail whatsoever has been submitted concerning restrictions in Division 5, where the applicant spent nearly three months. It follows that, while similar situations ‑ specifically decisions on punishment or security measures ‑ certainly call for an appropriate framework, which would also dispel any discrimination concerns, in the light of the Court ’ s case-law referred to in paragraph 75 above, from the material available to it the Court cannot find that the situation the applicant endured during that period raises issues within the ambit of Article 3."

The reasons that were advanced for the delay, such as the applicant ’ s allegedly intoxicated state or the radiographer ’ s absence on holiday, were found to be wholly unacceptable since the applicant was in the custody of the respondent State and it owed him a duty of care. In that case, although the Court accepted that the applicant must have suffered some pain, it could not speculate on its intensity and he had subsequently received adequate treatment for his injury, including an operation in a specialist hospital, regular check-ups and physiotherapy. Moreover, he had not submitted any evidence as to whether the continuing problems with his ankle were the consequence of the belated treatment or the injury itself. The Court thus considered that the one-day delay in treating his injury did not reach the necessary minimum level of severity to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. As in Răducu v.

In particular the Court observes that on 14 July, the date of the case summary, it had been noted that the applicant should have his dressing changed within three days. However, no record has been submitted to this effect and the Government have not claimed that this was done. As to the alleged visit by the nurse on 15 July 2013 – which occurred one day later and not three, as suggested in the case summary – the Court observes that the record, which consists of a short, barely legible, handwritten note, gives absolutely no indication as to whether any treatment was carried out. It is apparent from the general records submitted to the Court that such notes usually provide details such as the purpose of the visit – for example to administer medicines – yet none were provided about this alleged visit; there is thus little in the way of substantiation, if indeed it occurred at all."

The Government also stated that three other appointments with the ENT department took place between July and August 2013.

The Court reiterates that medical treatment within prison facilities must be appropriate and comparable to the quality of treatment which the State authorities have committed themselves to providing for the entire population. However, this does not mean that each detainee must be guaranteed the same medical treatment as is available in the best health establishments outside the prison facilities (see Cara- Damiani v. Italy, no. 2447/05, § 66, 7 February 2012).

In determining whether a life sentence in a given case can be regarded as irreducible, the Court has sought to ascertain whether a life prisoner can be said to have any prospect of release. An analysis of the Court ’ s case-law on the subject discloses that where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3. The Court has held, for instance, in a number of cases that, where detention was subject to review for the purposes of parole after the expiry of the minimum term for serving the life sentence, it could not be said that the life prisoners in question had been deprived of any hope of release (see, for example, Stanford, cited above; Hill v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 19365/02, 18 March 2003; and Wynne, cited above ). The Court has found that this is the case even in the absence of a minimum term of unconditional imprisonment and even when the possibility of parole for prisoners serving a life sentence is limited ( see, for example, Einhorn, cited above, §§ 27- 28 ). It follows that a life sentence does not become “irreducible” by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible."

Norway, no. 14610/89, Commission decision of 9 July 1991, DR 71, p. 168), it is clear from the relevant case-law that the existence of a system providing for consideration of the possibility of release is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the compatibility of a particular life sentence with Article 3. In this context, however, it should be observed that a State ’ s choice of a specific criminal- justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

At the outset the Court notes that in Cyprus the offence of premeditated murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraphs 3 1 -3 3 above), which under the Criminal Code, as confirmed by the domestic courts, is tantamount to imprisonment for the rest of the convicted person ’ s life. Furthermore, it observes that Cypriot law does not provide for a minimum term for serving a life sentence or for the possibility of its remission on the basis of good conduct and industry. However, the adjustment of such a sentence is possible at any stage irrespective of the time served in prison. In particular, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution as it has been applied since 1963, the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, may suspend, remit or commute any sentence passed by a court (see paragraphs 3 6 - 3 7 above). The President can therefore at any point in time commute a life sentence to another one of a shorter duration and then remit it, affording the possibility of immediate release. Moreover, section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996 provides for the conditional release of prisoners, including life prisoners (see paragraph 59 above). In line with this provision, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the President, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, can order by decree the conditional release of a prisoner at any time."

Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Government, there are certain shortcomings in the current procedure (see paragraph 91 above). Notwithstanding, the Court does not find that life sentences in Cyprus are irreducible with no possibility of release; on the contrary, it is clear that in Cyprus such sentences are both de jure and de facto reducible. In this connection, the Court notes that from the parties ’ submissions it transpires that life prisoners have been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution. In particular, nine life prisoners were released in 1993 and another two in 1997 and 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 5 2 and 90 above and paragraph 158 below ). All of these prisoners, apart from one, had been serving mandatory life sentences. In addition, a life prisoner can benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment.

In this connection, the Court observes that at the present time there is not yet a clear and commonly accepted standard amongst the member States of the Council of Europe concerning life sentences and, in particular, their review and method of adjustment. Moreover, no clear tendency can be ascertained with regard to the system and procedures implemented in respect of early release."

Bearing in mind the chronology of events and, in particular, the lapse of time between them, it cannot be said that the applicant could justifiably harbour genuine expectations that he would be released in November 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that apart from the clear sentence passed by the Assize Court in 1989 the relevant changes in the domestic law happened within a period of approximately four years, that is, between 1992 and 1996, thus about six years before the release date given by the prison authorities to the applicant came around.

We completely agree with this judgment to which we refer.

                "“ ... What is of importance in the present case is the principle set out in the case of Hogben and not the differences in the details of the facts. The principle then that has been laid down in the case of Hogben is that Article 7 applies only to the sentence that is imposed and not to the manner of serving the sentence. Therefore Article 7 does not prohibit a retrospective change in the law or in practice concerning release or conditional release from prison of a prisoner.",
                "I am therefore of the view that the principle set out in Hogben can be applied in the present case. Everything that the learned counsel of the applicant has pleaded has to do with the practice of release from prison. In the instant case the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant and explained to him at the same time that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. What the prison authorities then did, with the F5 form, constitutes an action concerning the execution of the sentence. After the case of Hadjisavvas the Regulations on the basis of which the prison authorities gave the applicant the F5 form, have ceased to apply, with the result that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the applicant by the Assize Court is applicable. What happened was a change in the legal situation concerning the time of the applicant ’ s release. As in the Hogben case, Article 7 § 1 of the Convention is not applicable.",
                "I endorse the principle set out in Hogben. I consider that the applicant cannot derive a right to judicial review on the basis of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention because of the alleged change in the date of his release from prison which does not change the legal basis for his detention. It should be emphasised that his detention is founded on the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him by the Assize Court and this had been explained to him as ‘ imprisonment for the remainder of his life ’. It follows that the relevant suggestion by Mr Demetriades does not stand and is dismissed.",
                "On this occasion, I should add that the decision of the Commission on the issue of interpretation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium ( ‘ Vagrancy ’ cases ) 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12 ) ...",
                "The fact that Hogben is a decision of the Commission does not render it less persuasive. It constitutes a decision of a specialised organ with vast experience in interpreting the Convention. It therefore constitutes an authority of great persuasiveness. I am satisfied about the correctness of the Commission ’ s decision in Hogben, which I have endorsed.",
                "It was further the suggestion of Mr Demetriades that ‘ this kind of sentence imposed on the applicant without the possibility of examination by a Parole Board does not conform with Article 3 of the Convention ’.",
                "I endorse the above approach [in Hogben ]. Its essence is that the change in release policy does not constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. The existence or not of a Parole Board does not form part of the ratio of the decision. This answers the suggestion of Mr Demetriades concerning the absence of a Parole Board in Cyprus. Consequently, his suggestion based on Article 3 of the Convention does not stand and is dismissed.",

As stated, however, in the case of Doros Georgiades (Civil Appeal no. 11355, 3 October 2002), adopting the relevant position of English jurisprudence (see Halsbury ’ s Laws of England, 4th edition, Volume 11, §§ 1472 and 1473):",
                "‘ In general the writ of habeas corpus will not be granted to persons convicted or in execution under legal process, including persons in execution of a legal sentence after conviction on indictment. The writ of habeas corpus will not be granted where the effect of it would be to review the judgment of one of the superior courts which might have been reviewed on appeal or to question the decision of an inferior court or tribunal on a matter within its jurisdiction; or where it would falsify the record of a court which shows jurisdiction on the face of it. ’",

Furthermore, he does not suggest or attempt a review of the Assize Court ’ s judgment, as was wrongly perceived at first instance. We are not going against, as he explained, the Assize Court ’ s judgment but the Republic as a whole. The Regulations were then applicable at that time and since the Assize Court had not annulled them for being unconstitutional, we must conclude that it considered them valid. And since the law does not provide a definition of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’, it was an element of the regulation of the sentence provided. As Mr Demetriades put it, the overall legal situation at the time of the imposition of the sentence, indicated that life imprisonment meant in essence twenty years ’ imprisonment. In addition, even if there was doubt, this had to be taken to the applicant ’ s benefit. Hence, in view of this fact, there was no reason to lodge an appeal against the Assize Court ’ s judgment especially since the applicant had been served with the F5 notice.",

However, as has been decided (see Georgios Mavrogenis v. the House of Representatives and Others (1996) 1 A.A.D. 315, at 341 and Alekos N. Clerides v. the Republic of Cyprus, 20 October 2000), judicial assessment necessarily adjudicates retrospectively on the law or regulation and, as the principle of separation of powers dictates, it does not entail a legislative development. It is a fact, however, that this question, both at first instance and before us, has not been touched upon from this point of view so as to raise the issue of Law no. 62(1)/96.",
                "In any event the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant, expressly specifying that this meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. This was the reason for which it did not examine the question of possible consecutiveness and the appellant ’ s perception that it is inferred that the Assize Court recognised the Regulations as valid is wrong. The Assize Court essentially considered that the Regulations were not connected with the issue of the sentence envisaged for it did not consider that the then existent Regulations changed the fact that in accordance with the law, imprisonment for the remainder of the appellant ’ s life was imposed.",
                "Was this approach wrong? Did in reality the law, viewed as a whole, even in the light of the interpretation suggested by the appellant comparing Article 7 § 1 of the Convention with Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution, envisage imprisonment for only twenty years? We would say that the first- instance judgment was not wrong in finding that this situation corresponded to the one in the case of Hogben. The principle applied, namely that Article 7 § 1 of the Convention does not concern the enforcement of the sentence, which remains one of life imprisonment, is not in question. The Regulations were made on the basis of and for the purposes of the Prison (Discipline) Law, whereas it is the Criminal Code that determines the sentence, in this case mandatory life imprisonment and no other.",

Obviously the constitutional legislation singled out the crimes listed in Article 7 § 2 for exceptional treatment in view of their gravity and their repercussions on the well- being of society. In the case of premeditated murder what marks the gravity of the offence is the element of premeditation that necessarily renders the crime particularly heinous.

Andreas Costa Aristodemou, alias Yiouroukkis (case no. 31175/87) the Nicosia Assize Court, when sentencing the accused for premeditated murder under the Criminal Code, stated, among other things, the following:",
                "“ The accused has been sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of premeditated murder. This sentence is imposed by the Court mandatorily; since it is the only one provided by the Criminal Code, Cap. 154, as amended by Law no. 86/83, which also amends section 29 of the Criminal Code, the Court cannot impose another sentence for the crime of premeditated murder. After the abolition by this Law of the death penalty, the legislature provided for the above sentence so it would be in agreement with Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. This Article provides for the commutation of a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment, in the event that the President of the Republic exercises his right of pardon on the basis of § 1 of that Article.",
                "Counsel for the accused suggested that the Court should order that the sentence of life imprisonment that was imposed on the accused should run concurrently with the one he is already serving.",
                "... [ i ]n support of his suggestion he referred to the case of R v. Foy (1962) 2 All E.R. 246.",
                "... In contrast, Mr Kyprianou argued that the Court must order that the sentence imposed should be served after the one already being served by the accused because, on the basis of the Regulations of 1987 (Official Gazette of the Republic, Annex 3, Part 1 of 13/3/87), which were made by the Council of Ministers and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic after being put before Parliament, the interpretation of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’ is given as meaning ‘ imprisonment for twenty years ’. Regulation 93 of these Regulations provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment may be granted remission of his sentence on the ground of good conduct and industry, not exceeding in total one - quarter of this sentence. Therefore, Mr Kyprianou continued, the sentence of life imprisonment has been determined at a period of twenty years, or fifteen if the convicted person demonstrates good conduct. Consequently, what Lord Parker said in the case of R v. Foy, on which counsel for the accused relied, does not apply. Mr Kyprianou also showed his concern, as Senior Counsel of the Republic, about the possible cases, such as the present one, where one person commits many murders but is only given one sentence of imprisonment for fifteen or twenty years.",
                "Our opinion is that neither Mr Kyprianou nor Mr Clerides is treating the legal issue correctly.",
                "On the basis of everything said by Lord Parker [in the case of R v. Foy (1962) 2 All E.R. 246], life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the time for which the applicant is alive. Accordingly, and since a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed on the accused, no other such sentence can follow. Mr Clerides suggests, however, that the court must issue this order, for he is also basing himself on the Regulations of 1987 and is concerned that, since these Regulations are in force, the accused may possibly be released in fifteen years and thus is not facing the danger of serving another prison sentence of fifteen or twenty years, if the second sentence follows the first one.",
                "Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution provides that a court may not impose a longer sentence than that provided for by the law at the time of the commission of the offence. The Criminal Code indeed provides that the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory and the only sentence following conviction for premeditated murder. In our judgment, the sentence ‘ imprisonment for life ’ means exactly what is stated by the simple Greek words, that is, imprisonment for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person. This interpretation was also given by the Court of Appeal of England in the case of R v. Foy ... As we have already stated, section 203 (2) of the Criminal Code is the only provision prescribing the sentence of life imprisonment as mandatory, and this in the light of the provisions of Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. The Regulations of 1987 were drawn up on the basis of the Prison (Discipline) Law (Cap. 286), which still applies on the basis of the provisions of the Constitution even though it was enacted just when Cyprus became an English colony. The provisions of this law, however, have to be applied in such a way that they comply with the express provisions of the Constitution. We wonder whether these Regulations are not unconstitutional and whether the interpretation of the term ‘ imprisonment for life ’, which is encountered in the Constitution and the Criminal Code, so as to mean ‘ twenty years ’, is arbitrary. We say ‘ we wonder ’ since such an issue has not been raised before us and thus we have no right in this procedure to convey an opinion on this. Another observation that can be made, however, is the following: it appears that the drafters of the Regulations, even if they are valid, did not notice the special provision of section 11 of the above Law (Cap. 286) which concerns life prisoners and provides that they may be released on licence by a decision of the ‘ Governor ’, which may be revoked. The life sentence is specifically provided for in the above Law to last for life, along the lines of the English legal system. This is why Lord Parker stated what we quoted above. Another issue that is raised, even for the purposes of academic debate, is to what extent a law or regulation can provide for the remission, suspension or commutation of a convicted person ’ s sentence in view of the express provision of Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution which bestows this privilege on the President of the Republic with the concurrence of the Attorney-General.",
                "It has been established by judicial precedent that when the court imposes a sentence, it does not take into account regulations, even if they are applicable, that allow for the remission of the sentence when a convicted person displays good conduct. The Regulations of 1987 were made in order to serve the purposes to which the court does not refer when passing the sentence, which is determined on the basis of the applicable legislation and the Constitution. It is therefore up to the competent authorities, when and if the matter is raised at the appropriate time, to take into account what we have mentioned above in the form of legal observations. We have already imposed on the accused the sentence that the law envisages, that is, life imprisonment, and we have nothing else to add .”"

The prisoner in that case had also been convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He had submitted a habeas corpus application to the Supreme Court when he was not released on the date that had been given to him as a release date by the prison authorities. The Supreme Court dismissed his application and affirmed that the term “life imprisonment” under the Criminal Code meant imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person. In particular, the court stated as follows:",
                "“The Criminal Code provides a mandatory sentence for the crime of premeditated murder: ‘ ... a sentence of imprisonment for life ’ (see section 203(2) of the Criminal Code as amended by Law no. 86/83). The constitutionality of this provision of the law was examined in the case of Politis v. Republic (1987) 2 C. L. R. 116 and was held to be correct in the light of the provisions of Articles 7 § 2 and 12 § 3 of the Constitution. The sentence of life imprisonment is not equated by the legislature with a prison sentence for any period of time, neither where it is imposed as a mandatory punitive measure on the basis of section 203(2) nor as a discretionary measure under section 29 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 154. This would anyhow be contrary to the provisions of these two sections of the Criminal Code since life imprisonment is mandatory for the crime of premeditated murder whereas for the purposes of section 29, where life imprisonment is a discretionary measure, the courts have the discretion to impose a sentence of a shorter period. A prison sentence for a period shorter than life imprisonment may comprise a sentence longer than imprisonment for twenty years with which life imprisonment is equated on the basis of Regulation 2 of the Prison Regulations. In the case of Georghios Aristidou v. Republic (1967) 2 C.L.R. 43 the Court of Appeal imposed a sentence of imprisonment of twenty-five years following the commutation of the appellant ’ s conviction for premeditated murder to manslaughter.",

In President of Republic v. House of Representatives (1985) 3 C.L.R. 2165 and President of Republic v.

Sampson (Civil Appeal 8532, decided on 26 September 1991) the full bench of the Supreme Court had the opportunity to examine the legal status of the Prison Regulations in relation to the enabling law, the Prison (Discipline) Law, Cap. 286. At the outset we noted that this law was enacted in 1879 and, as with any other colonial law which was in force at the time of the proclamation of the Republic, the provisions of Cap. 286 are applied while being adjusted ‘ to the necessary extent to the Constitution ’ (Article 188 § 1 of the Constitution). This adjustment, as we have pointed out, is within the competence of the judiciary (see, inter alia, Diagoras Development v National Bank (1985) 1 C.L.R. 581, and United Pibles Societies (Gulf) v. Hadjikakou (Civil Appeal 7413, decided on 28 May 1990).",

                "Consequently, to the degree and extent that section 4, in conjunction with section 9, of Cap. 286 confers power for the determination of the duration of a sentence of imprisonment on an authority other than a judicial one, it is contrary to the Constitution and has ceased to be in force following the proclamation of the Republic. Besides, the granting of power to the Director of Prisons to remit the sentence because of good conduct and industry, under the provisions of Regulation 93, is contrary to the principle of the separation of powers, which precludes the involvement of an executive or administrative organ in the determination of the punishment of an offender. The only authority on whom power is conferred by the Constitution to remit, suspend or commute a prison sentence is the President of the Republic, acting with the concurrence of the Attorney General. The examination of the power to make secondary legislation conferred by sections 4 and 9 of Cap. 286 is not directly required in this case, since neither of the two provisions concerns the serving of a sentence of life imprisonment. The serving of life imprisonment is regulated specifically by the provisions of section 11 of Cap. 286, from which it emerges that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person, subject to the right granted to the President of the Republic to suspend the sentence for such period of time as may be fixed on the release of the convicted person on licence. Section 11 of Cap. 286 is in harmony with the Constitution and has maintained its force after the proclamation of the Republic inasmuch as it is consistent with the powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution .”"

The central component of this process now in progress is the regulating by law of life imprisonment in a way which will give the possibility to those serving life sentences of being released once they have served a significant part of their sentence and previously received the appropriate treatment and preparation.

In accordance with the separation of powers, the regulating by law of the matter could include, in the case of the imposition by the courts of the sentence of life imprisonment, empowering the same court to fix a minimum term for the sentence which would be served obligatorily before examination of the possibility of the conditional release of the prisoner. I am of the opinion that this minimum term of the sentence should not exceed twenty to twenty-five years. Within the framework of the proposed regulation a committee may be set up with an advisory role which, on the basis of enacted criteria and in accordance with the rehabilitation progress of each prisoner serving a life sentence and the particular circumstances of each case, could recommend conditional release.",

Prior to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 19, 5 0 and 5 1 above ), the Regulations – in particular Regulations 2 and 93 – were understood by the executive and administrative authorities of the Republic, including the Prison Service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Any prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment after the above Regulations came into force would, in practice, have had a period of five years automatically deducted from the time to be served in prison by way of remission pursuant to Regulation 93. Thereafter, days of remission could be deducted from this five- year period as a consequence of misconduct by the prisoner. It was understood by the Republic ’ s executive and administrative authorities, including the Prison Service, that a life prisoner ’ s misconduct could not result in him being detained beyond the twenty- year point. In fact, because of the very limited number of life prisoners in Cyprus and the dates of their respective convictions, no life prisoner had ever reached the point in his sentence when these provisions were applied directly so as to lead to his release. The release of the nine life prisoners in 1993 had been pursuant to Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in the light of how the Regulations would have operated in their cases."

In its judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, the Supreme Court declared Regulation 93 to be unconstitutional and ultra vires in relation to the enabling primary legislation, namely the Prison Discipline Law. Under Cypriot domestic law, the position was that in proceedings where the constitutionality of subsidiary legislation was raised by a party by way of collateral challenge, the court ’ s judgment only took effect in relation to the particular subject matter of the proceedings. Thus, the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, in which the constitutionality of Regulation 93 had been raised as a collateral issue to Mr Hadjisavvas ’ s habeas corpus application, was only operative so as to determine the ongoing legality of his detention. It also followed from Article 144 § 3 of the Constitution that the above judgment did not operate so as to render Regulation 93 unconstitutional and invalid as against persons other than the parties to that case. In other words, it did not result in Regulation 93 being rendered invalid vis-à-vis other individuals."

Because the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in Hadjisavvas had been binding on the parties to the case, including the executive and administrative authorities of the Republic, Regulation 93 could not thereafter lawfully be applied by the above authorities. Nonetheless, the judgment could not be understood as having retrospective effect such as to impugn the validity of Regulation 93 as it had been applied to other individuals affected by that Regulation. Therefore, the fact that Regulation 93 was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court in 1992 did not have retrospective effect such as to render the Regulation void ab initio for all purposes. It did not, for example, render unlawful any action taken pursuant to Regulation 93 between the date of its enactment and the judgment in Hadjisavvas. Accordingly, at the time of the applicant ’ s offence in July 1987 or at the time he was sentenced in March 1989, Regulation 93 could not have been void or without legal effect in respect of the applicant. After the Hadjisavvas judgment, however, the administrative and executive authorities of the Republic could not lawfully take action, in reliance on Regulation 93, treating it as reducing a life sentence imposed by a court to a maximum of twenty years ’ imprisonment since this would have been inconsistent with the Constitution as authoritatively interpreted by the Supreme Court in that judgment.",

Secondly, he complained that the unexpected reversal of his legitimate expectations for release and his continuous detention beyond the date which had been set for his release by the prison authorities had left him in a state of distress and uncertainty over his future for a significant period of time.

The applicant drew a distinction between the time the sentence had been imposed in 1989 and after 1996, when the twenty- year definition of a life sentence had been abolished. On the F5 form, which the applicant had received when he had been admitted to prison, it had been clearly marked “twenty years” under the heading “ Sentence ”. He had then been informed that he would be released on 16 July 200 2 subject to his good conduct. Following the commission of a disciplinary offence his release date was delayed until 2 November 2002. However, further to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 19, 5 0 and 5 1 above), in which it had been declared that the Regulations were unconstitutional, and the subsequent repeal of those Regulations in 1996 excluding any possibility of remission for life prisoners, the imposition of mandatory imprisonment had become imprisonment for the rest of one ’ s life."

The applicant stressed that under the legislative scheme currently in force in Cyprus there was no parole board system and no provision was made for the granting of parole to prisoners or for the protection of their rights during the execution of their sentence and their readmission to society. Thus, the principal purpose of the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Cypriot courts and subsequently enforced by the relevant authorities was punitive. This, in the applicant ’ s view, coupled with the mandatory nature of the sentence, was contrary to Article 3 of the Convention ( relying, inter alia, on Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 72, ECHR 2002- VIII). The procedure currently in place granted unfettered discretion to the President and was arbitrary in its nature. In this context the applicant referred to the ex officio report of 26 May 2004 by the Cypriot Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) on the penitentiary system of Cyprus and the conditions of detention in the Central Prisons (see paragraph 6 3 above)."

Although prisoners fell within a specific category of right-holders, they nevertheless had rights that ought to be protected by the authorities ( here the applicant relied on Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61 ). Cypriot law imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in all cases of murder, depriving the courts of the vital discretion which judges should be allowed, having regard to the rights of the convicted person in imposing a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed. In this connection the applicant referred to Recommendation R (92) 17 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States concerning consistency in sentencing, adopted by the Ministers ’ Deputies on 19 October 1991, according to which “whatever rationales for sentencing are declared, disproportionality between the seriousness of the offence and the sentences should be avoided ”.

In this connection the applicant stated that in both France and Italy it had been explicitly recognised that an offender sentenced to life imprisonment had a fundamental right to be considered for release. In addition, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had recognised that a life sentence that had been fully implemented invariably entailed the loss of human dignity and the denial of the controversial right to rehabilitation. A release mechanism had been set up in Germany to ensure that life sentences were not implemented in a way that undermined human dignity by suppressing all hopes of release. Furthermore, it was a general requirement of international human rights law that a convicted person should not be deprived of a second opportunity to return to society, following a non-problematic serving of his punishment and sentence and the completion of a rehabilitation procedure."

As a result, since 2002, he had been subjected to continuing feelings of anguish and uncertainty.

Notwithstanding the gravity of his crime, like all life prisoners, he had sufficient hope for release under domestic law for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention. First of all, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic could, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by a court in the Republic. Secondly, under section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996, the President could, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, order the conditional release of a prisoner, including a prisoner serving a life sentence, at any time. Prisoners were free to apply to the President and the Attorney-General whenever they wished for release under the above provisions. Although release was a matter within the exclusive authority of the President, his decision involved the advice and required the agreement of the Attorney-General, who acted as an independent officer and not as part of the Republic ’ s executive authorities. Consequently, his participation added an element of independence to the process."

In deciding whether to exercise his powers under the above provision, the President took into account the nature of the offence, the amount of time a prisoner had already served and any exceptional or compassionate grounds for early release. In this connection, the Government noted that an expression of genuine remorse on the part of a lifer would be an important consideration though not decisive. The President further determined whether the continued detention of the prisoner was necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence or for protecting the public from risk of serious harm."

                "89. The Government observed that, from an examination of the Commission ’ s and Court ’ s case-law on Article 3, the appropriate test to apply was whether an applicant had been deprived of “all hope of obtaining an adjustment of his sentence” : a test which entailed asking whether the sentence was reducible de jure and de facto. If a sentence of life imprisonment was reducible de jure, the mere fact that the prospects of early release were limited or that the decision about whether to grant early release depended on the discretion of the executive, even if that discretion was not subject to the review of the domestic courts, did not violate Article 3, provided that de facto there was a realistic possibility of that discretion being exercised in the future. A life prisoner would have to show either that early release was a legal impossibility or that there was no realistic prospect of early release in practice. In this connection, the Government relied on the Court ’ s decision in Einhorn v. France (( dec. ), no. 71555/01, ECHR 2001- XI) and argued that there were clear parallels between the situation in Cyprus and that in Pennsylvania."

There was no reason to think that these provisions would never be exercised de facto. In practice, life prisoners had been released. Subsequent to the nine life prisoners released in 1993, two other life prisoners had been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in 1997 and 2005. There was no evidence in the present case indicating that in a change of circumstances in which the applicant displayed significant remorse for his crimes, which he had not done so far, and was no longer considered to represent any significant danger to society, he could not be released under the above provisions."

In particular, they noted that, at present, firstly, there was no published procedure or criteria governing the operation of Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution or section 14(1) of the Prison Law of 1996; secondly, there was no obligation to disclose to a prisoner the opinion of the Attorney-General on his application; thirdly, there was no requirement for the President to give reasons for refusing an application for early release, nor was this the practice; and, finally, refusal to order early release was not amenable to judicial review in the courts."

                "92. Furthermore, although there was no clear consensus among member States with regard to early release for lifers and the criteria to be applied in this respect, there was an increasing emphasis in the practice of some member States, in the statements issued by Council of Europe institutions and in the Court ’ s jurisprudence, on the need for fair, consistent and transparent procedures in the administration of provisions governing early release for those serving life sentences. With all the above in mind and before the present application had been lodged, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order had initiated a review of the procedures in Cyprus with a view to improving the rights of life prisoners. The Government noted that the proposals for legislative reform would be put forward at some time during 2007. They submitted a draft bill that had been prepared for the purposes of amending section 14 of the Prison Law. The proposals for amendment involved, inter alia, the fixing of a minimum period to be served to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence before a prisoner could be considered eligible for parole on licence under section 14 of the Prison Law and the establishment of an independent parole board with responsibility for assessing the risk to the public once the relevant part of the sentence had been served and with the power to direct a prisoner ’ s release on licence where the evidence indicated an acceptable level of risk. The provisions of the bill set out in detail the procedure to be followed by the board and the rights of prisoners in this matter. Nonetheless, the Government stressed that the fact that they were considering reform of the present system did not entail an acceptance that there had been a violation of the applicant ’ s Convention rights."

This was particularly so given that, in sentencing the applicant, the Limassol Assize Court had adopted the earlier judgment of the Nicosia Assize Court in the case of The Republic of Cyprus v. Yiouroukkis, casting doubts on the compatibility of the Regulations both with the Constitution and section 1 1 of the Prison Discipline Law. The Limassol Assize Court had rejected the possibility of imposing three consecutive terms and had concluded that imprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused ’ s life. The applicant had also been present at the sentencing hearing. Consequently, the applicant ’ s expectation about his future release must have been significantly qualified by that court ’ s judgment, notwithstanding the administrative form given to him shortly thereafter upon his admission to prison."

Furthermore, if the applicant had sought the advice of counsel immediately after the sentence had been passed, he would no doubt have been advised that he should not assume that he would automatically be released after fifteen or even twenty years. In addition, three and a half years after the applicant had been sentenced, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, thus definitively resolving the issue. So for the past fourteen years the position in domestic law had been quite clear. It could not therefore be said that the applicant had been in a state of uncertainty throughout his sentence."

The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25 )."

In determining whether a life sentence in a given case can be regarded as irreducible, the Court has sought to ascertain whether a life prisoner can be said to have any prospect of release. An analysis of the Court ’ s case-law on the subject discloses that where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3. The Court has held, for instance, in a number of cases that, where detention was subject to review for the purposes of parole after the expiry of the minimum term for serving the life sentence, it could not be said that the life prisoners in question had been deprived of any hope of release (see, for example, Stanford, cited above; Hill v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 19365/02, 18 March 2003; and Wynne, cited above ). The Court has found that this is the case even in the absence of a minimum term of unconditional imprisonment and even when the possibility of parole for prisoners serving a life sentence is limited ( see, for example, Einhorn, cited above, §§ 27- 28 ). It follows that a life sentence does not become “irreducible” by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible."

Norway, no. 14610/89, Commission decision of 9 July 1991, DR 71, p. 168), it is clear from the relevant case-law that the existence of a system providing for consideration of the possibility of release is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the compatibility of a particular life sentence with Article 3. In this context, however, it should be observed that a State ’ s choice of a specific criminal- justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

In reaching its decision the Court has had regard to the standards prevailing amongst the member States of the Council of Europe in the field of penal policy, in particular concerning sentence review and release arrangements (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 102, Series A no. 161; and V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, § 72, ECHR 1999- IX ).

                "102. At the outset the Court notes that in Cyprus the offence of premeditated murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraphs 3 1 -3 3 above), which under the Criminal Code, as confirmed by the domestic courts, is tantamount to imprisonment for the rest of the convicted person ’ s life. Furthermore, it observes that Cypriot law does not provide for a minimum term for serving a life sentence or for the possibility of its remission on the basis of good conduct and industry. However, the adjustment of such a sentence is possible at any stage irrespective of the time served in prison. In particular, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution as it has been applied since 1963, the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, may suspend, remit or commute any sentence passed by a court (see paragraphs 3 6 - 3 7 above). The President can therefore at any point in time commute a life sentence to another one of a shorter duration and then remit it, affording the possibility of immediate release. Moreover, section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996 provides for the conditional release of prisoners, including life prisoners (see paragraph 59 above). In line with this provision, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the President, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, can order by decree the conditional release of a prisoner at any time."

                "103. Admittedly, it follows from the above provisions that the prospect of release for prisoners serving life sentences in Cyprus is limited, any adjustment of a life sentence being only within the President ’ s discretion, subject to the agreement of the Attorney-General. Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Government, there are certain shortcomings in the current procedure (see paragraph 91 above). Notwithstanding, the Court does not find that life sentences in Cyprus are irreducible with no possibility of release; on the contrary, it is clear that in Cyprus such sentences are both de jure and de facto reducible. In this connection, the Court notes that from the parties ’ submissions it transpires that life prisoners have been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution. In particular, nine life prisoners were released in 1993 and another two in 1997 and 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 5 2 and 90 above and paragraph 158 below ). All of these prisoners, apart from one, had been serving mandatory life sentences. In addition, a life prisoner can benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment. Consequently, it cannot be inferred that the applicant has no possibility of release and he has not adduced evidence to warrant such an inference."

However, the Court reiterates that matters relating to early release policies including the manner of their implementation fall within the power member States have in the sphere of criminal justice and penal policy (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour, cited above, § 44 ). In this connection, the Court observes that at the present time there is not yet a clear and commonly accepted standard amongst the member States of the Council of Europe concerning life sentences and, in particular, their review and method of adjustment. Moreover, no clear tendency can be ascertained with regard to the system and procedures implemented in respect of early release."

In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant cannot claim that he has been deprived of any prospect of release and that his continued detention as such, even though long, constitutes inhuman or degrading treatment. However, the Court is conscious of the shortcomings in the procedure currently in place (see paragraph 9 1 above) and notes the recent steps taken for the introduction of reforms."

Furthermore, with regard to the applicant ’ s second complaint, although the change in the applicable legislation and consequent frustration of his expectations of release must have caused him a certain amount of anxiety, the Court does not consider that in the circumstances this attained the level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3. Bearing in mind the chronology of events and, in particular, the lapse of time between them, it cannot be said that the applicant could justifiably harbour genuine expectations that he would be released in November 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that apart from the clear sentence passed by the Assize Court in 1989 the relevant changes in the domestic law happened within a period of approximately four years, that is, between 1992 and 1996, thus about six years before the release date given by the prison authorities to the applicant came around. Therefore, any feelings of hope on the part of the applicant linked to the prospect of early release must have diminished as it became clear with the changes in domestic law that he would be serving the life sentence passed on him by the Assize Court."

It had simply proceeded to impose the sentence. He had then served his sentence but had not been released when his sentence had expired on 2 November 2002.

At all times since his conviction, the applicant ’ s detention had been authorised by the sentence of life imprisonment prescribed by the Criminal Code and passed by the Limassol Assize Court. The causal link with the original sentence had not therefore been broken. In this connection, they pointed out that the applicant ’ s sentence, being a mandatory life sentence, had not been imposed by reference to considerations pertaining to the dangerousness of the offender, which were amenable to change over time; the sentence was not divided up into a punitive element, that is, a punitive “tariff” phase of detention, and a subsequent element based on the risk presented by the prisoner, that is, an ensuing phase of detention on the grounds of public protection."

This was irrespective of the fact that a life prisoner might, in practice, be released under the Constitution or the Prison Law of 1996. Likewise, in the case of Hadjisavvas, the Supreme Court had held that the legislature did not equate the sentence of life imprisonment to imprisonment for any time- span, either where this was imposed as a mandatory measure of punishment under section 203(2) of the Criminal Code, or where it was imposed as a discretionary measure under section 23 of the Code."

Belgium, 24 June 19 82, § 38, Series A no. 50 ). In addition, any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, §§ 39 and 45, Series A no. 33, and Amuur, cited above, § 50)."

It would then also be necessary to consider whether the maximum penalty prescribed by the regulations was fifteen years or twenty years.

In sum, the “law” is the provision in force as the competent courts have interpreted it ( see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 88, ECHR 2005- XI )."

France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports 1996-V; Coëme and Others, cited above, § 145; and E.K. v. Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002). These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Achour, cited above, § 41). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act committed and/or omission (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, ibid., § 35, and Achour, cited above, § 54 )."

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times ( no. 1 ), § 49, and Kokkinakis, § 40, both cited above ). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni, cited above). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001-II)."

                "142. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is, like the notions of “civil right and obligations” and “criminal charge” in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, and Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317-B ). The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28, and Jamil, cited above, § 31). To this end, both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a “penalty” and a measure that concerns the “execution” or “enforcement” of the “penalty”. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 (see, inter alia, Hogben, cited above; Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996, unreported; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Uttley, cited above).

On the one hand the applicant maintains that at the time he committed the offence of which he was convicted life imprisonment had been tantamount to imprisonment for a period of twenty years. The subsequent repeal of the Prison Regulations and the retroactive application of the Prison Law of 1996 brought about both an unforeseeable prolongation of his term of imprisonment to an indefinite term for the remainder of his life and a change in the conditions of his detention. On the other hand the Government submit that section 203(2) of the Criminal Code was, and still remains, the only substantive provision of domestic law prescribing the penalty of a life sentence to be imposed by the courts for premeditated murder. This was the penalty imposed by the Limassol Assize Court on the applicant. The Prison Regulations concerned the execution of the life sentence imposed by the court, namely, the assessment of a possible remission of his sentence on the grounds of good conduct and diligence."

The prison authorities were applying the Prison Regulations, made on the basis of the Prison Discipline Law (Cap. 286), under which all prisoners, including life prisoners, were eligible for remission of their sentence on the grounds of good conduct and industry. For these purposes, Regulation 2 defined life imprisonment as meaning imprisonment for twenty years (see paragraph 4 2 above). As admitted by the Government, this was understood at the time by the executive and the administrative authorities, including the prison service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment ( see paragraph 6 5 above ). The prison authorities were therefore assessing the remission of the life sentences of prisoners on the basis of twenty years ’ imprisonment. This also transpires from the letter sent by the then Attorney-General of the Republic to the President at that time (see paragraph 5 3 above)."

Andreas Costa Aristodemou, alias Yiouroukkis, clearly stated that life imprisonment under the Criminal Code was for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person and not for twenty years. Subsequently, on 10 March 1989 the Limassol Assize Court, when passing sentence on the applicant, relied on the findings of the Nicosia Assize Court in the above case. It accordingly sentenced the applicant to “life imprisonment” for the remainder of his life. In spite of this, when the applicant was admitted to prison to serve his sentence, he was given a written notice by the prison authorities with a conditional release date, the remission of his life sentence having been assessed on the basis that it amounted to imprisonment for a term of twenty years. It was not until 9 October 1992 in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus ( see paragraphs 19 and 50 above) that the Regulations were declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 50-51 above).

The distinction between the scope of a life sentence and the manner of its execution was therefore not immediately apparent. The first clarification by a domestic court in this respect was given in the Yiouroukkis case subsequent to the commission of the offence by the applicant that led to his prosecution and conviction. Furthermore, the Court notes that in both the case of Yiouroukkis and that of the applicant, the prosecution was inclined to take the view that life imprisonment was limited to a period of twenty years (see paragraphs 15 and 47 above)."

Although the changes in the prison legislation and in the conditions of release may have rendered the applicant ’ s imprisonment effectively harsher, these changes cannot be construed as imposing a heavier “penalty” than that imposed by the trial court (see Hogben and Hosein, both cited above ). In this connection, the Court would reiterate that issues relating to release policies, the manner of their implementation and the reasoning behind them fall within the power of the member States in determining their own criminal policy (see Achour, cited above, § 44).

The other nine prisoners had all been sentenced prior to the judgment in the case of Yiouroukkis, in which these matters of interpretation of the life sentence and validity of the Regulations had first been raised. It was clear from the letters sent by the Attorney-General to the President that the nine prisoners had been released on the basis that it had been announced to them that their sentences would be twenty years ’ imprisonment.

In those circumstances, the President, acting on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, decided that it was appropriate, on humanitarian grounds, to release the nine prisoners early under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution. The same considerations did not apply to the applicant ’ s case. Therefore, the Government considered that by requiring the applicant to serve the term of life imprisonment ( unconstrained by any impact of the Regulations), thereby treating him differently from the other nine life prisoners, they had plainly pursued the legitimate penal aim of requiring the applicant to serve the full sentence imposed by the Criminal Code and the domestic courts.

Consequently, the High Contracting Parties are dispensed from answering for their acts or omissions in proceedings before the Court before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity, that the domestic legal system provides an effective remedy which can deal with the substance of an arguable complaint under the Convention and grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Ananyev and Others v.

The Government further argued that the forty ‑ year period corresponded primarily to the retribution phase of a whole life sentence and was proportionate to the circumstances of the offence.

The legislation also set out the elements that the Clemency Board needed to examine in the course of the mandatory pardon procedure and those elements were identical to what penitentiary judges had to assess when deciding on release on parole of non-life prisoners.

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 § 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one ’ s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 105, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Nevertheless, Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV, and Kosteski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ”, no. 55170/00, § 37, 13 April 2006). In order to count as a “manifestation” within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, §§ 73-74, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII; Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 78)"

For the Court, the apparent contradiction between the applicant ’ s abiding by the rules of these permissions and the authorities ’ insistence on him being a flight risk was not solved; and the authorities ’ reasoning remained limited to the possibility of a severe sentence, which alone cannot be considered sufficient, after a certain lapse of time, to justify continued detention."

Where a person is kept in detention pending the determination of a criminal charge against him, the fact of his detention is a factor to be considered in assessing whether the requirement of a decision on the merits within a reasonable time has been met ( see Abdoella v. the Netherlands, 25 November 1992, § 24, Series A no. 248 ‑ A)."

However, as further set out in Article 9 § 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one ’ s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 105, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Nevertheless, Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV, and Kosteski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ”, no. 55170/00, § 37, 13 April 2006). In order to count as a “manifestation” within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v.

In particular, in stating “it has been established that ... [the applicant] transferred a technical drawing accompanied with photographs describing the exact location of military units, an aerodrome and other strategic State installations which constitute State and military secrets” and “[the applicant] transferred information, photographs and technical drawings of the indicated areas and other military installations”, the investigating authorities risked prejudging the assessment of the facts by the courts and encouraging the public to believe that the applicant was guilty before he had been proved guilty in accordance with the law. Moreover, that unreserved attribution of the above-mentioned criminal acts to the applicant was described in the statement as a new relevant fact which had recently come to light in the investigation, which largely undermined the impact of the neutral wording used at the beginning of the statement.

The Court observes that Article 17.3 of the Law of 22 May 2012 provided that an investigating authority could restrict a detainee ’ s right to correspondence for the purposes of ensuring a criminal investigation. Article 19.8 of the Law of 22 May 2012 also provided that an investigating authority could restrict a detainee ’ s right to have visits and telephone calls for the same purposes (see paragraph 64 above).

The Azerbaijani Government also failed to refer to any legal provision laying down restrictions in respect of receiving and subscribing to socio ‑ political newspapers or magazines. Consequently, it is not possible to establish that the interference with the applicant ’ s right in this regard had a legal basis in domestic law, and thus the Court concludes that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive and subscribe to socio ‑ political newspapers or magazines was not in accordance with the law within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8."

In this regard, the Court reiterates that there is no reason for it to restrict itself to direct proof in relation to complaints under Article 18 of the Convention or apply a special standard of proof to such allegations (see Merabishvili, cited above, § 316), as depending on the circumstances of the case, an ulterior purpose cannot always be proved by pointing to a particularly inculpatory piece of evidence which clearly reveals an actual reason (for example, a written document, as in the case of Gusinskiy v.

As to the applicant’s claim that there is no guarantee that he will receive benefits from the pension insurance scheme given that he is required to continue working, the Court considers that he has not substantiated this argument in any way, for instance by providing the Court with decisions to that effect by the competent authorities."

                "77. In establishing what is to be considered “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention”, the Court will also have regard to the standards prevailing in member States (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 59, and Stummer, cited above, §§ 131 et seq.). As regards the practice of the Council of Europe member States, the Court notes that the comparative survey of twenty-eight countries shows that, in sixteen of those countries, sentenced prisoners are not required to work after reaching retirement age. In the remaining twelve member States surveyed, the issue is not explicitly addressed in domestic law. However, these countries usually provide for exemptions from the requirement for prisoners to work, notably on account of their capacities and their age. Consequently, the arrangements put in place by these countries resemble the approach taken in Switzerland. The Court therefore concludes that, in the absence of sufficient consensus among the Council of Europe member States on the requirement for prisoners to work after they have reached retirement age, the Swiss authorities enjoyed a considerable margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132)."

                "78. Moreover, the Court reiterates that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, of “[a] ny relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see, among other authorities, Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, § 131, ECHR 2010, and Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 29, Series A no. 18).",
                "In this connection the Court observes that Rule 105.2 of the 2006 European Prison Rules (see paragraph 27 above) states that “[s] entenced prisoners who have not reached the normal retirement age may be required to work, subject to their physical and mental fitness as determined by the medical practitioner”.",
                "Although the aforementioned European Prison Rules do not have binding legal force, the Court has always attributed considerable importance to them in its case-law. In the case before it, it observes that the wording of Rule 105.2 is quite open and that it does not impose a uniform regime as regards the requirement for prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In any event, the Court considers that this Rule should not necessarily be interpreted as completely prohibiting the member States from requiring prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In the present case the Court does not deem it necessary to provide a definitive answer to this question, bearing in mind that the member States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation when it comes to implementation of this Rule by the prison authorities, who are in any event better placed than the Court to assess issues linked to conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners. In that regard the Court takes the view that it is primarily for the domestic authorities to establish effective and practicable conditions and arrangements with a view to organising their prison systems, while at the same time complying with the requirements of the Convention."

                "Hence, the purpose of compulsory work in the context of the execution of custodial sentences and measures was to develop, maintain or promote prisoners’ capacity to resume working life after their release. In the Federal Court’s view, the requirement to work contributed to the execution of sentences and fostered appropriate social behaviour and the capacity to avoid reoffending. It was also designed to occupy prisoners, give structure to their daily lives and maintain order in the institution (point 1.6).",
                "The Federal Court added that, as prisoners got older, greater emphasis was placed on the obligation to provide them with the necessary support (necessary-support principle) and on reducing the negative impact of detention (principle of least possible harm). In the case of prisoners over the age of 65, the requirement to work served the purpose of avoiding the harmful effects of detention, for instance the isolation of persons who had reached retirement age, and preventing mental and physical deterioration. The work had to be tailored to the prisoner’s abilities, training and interests, and it was therefore necessary to avoid placing an excessive burden on prisoners over the age of 65. Lastly, in the case of persons who were less physically and mentally able, the occupation could take the form of therapeutic activity (point 1.6).",
                "The Federal Court further held that the Old-Age and Survivors’ Insurance Act was designed to guarantee a living income to persons who were no longer able to work because of their age. However, work performed in connection with the execution of a custodial sentence or measure was not comparable to an employment contract on the competitive labour market, but rather should be regarded as an occupation within a closed system. The Federal Court therefore held that the rules governing persons of pensionable age did not apply to prisoners (point 1.8).",
                "The Federal Court also found that an occupation carried out on a voluntary basis was not apt to fulfil the aims pursued by the requirement to work in prison (point 2.6.2).",

The work which prisoners aged over 65 were required to carry out in this closed system had three main characteristics. Firstly, the five closed institutions in question sought to devise individual programmes for prisoners aged over 65 in order to find appropriate activities that matched their abilities. Secondly, the work carried out by these prisoners usually had little in common with ordinary work carried out by employees outside prison or by prisoners who had not reached retirement age.

Prisoners who are unfit to work, as certified by a doctor, are exempted from the requirement to work. As to the specific situation of the applicant, his work appears to comply with these guidelines; it is clear from the Government’s observations that the applicant is required only to take part in supervised work such as colouring mandalas, cleaning his cell and making sculptures from driftwood. The Court shares the Government’s view that these activities are wholly appropriate to the applicant’s age and physical capacities, an assertion which the applicant did not dispute."

Lastly, with regard to the manner in which his work has to be performed, the Court observes that the applicant, together with other prisoners who have reached retirement age, has been placed in the “dependent and retired prisoners” wing of Pöschwies Prison. Furthermore, the applicant is paid for his work and, according to the Government, he does not suffer any loss of earnings if his capacity for work is reduced for medical reasons. As to the applicant’s claim that there is no guarantee that he will receive benefits from the pension insurance scheme given that he is required to continue working, the Court considers that he has not substantiated this argument in any way, for instance by providing the Court with decisions to that effect by the competent authorities."

In establishing what is to be considered “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention”, the Court will also have regard to the standards prevailing in member States (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 59, and Stummer, cited above, §§ 131 et seq.). As regards the practice of the Council of Europe member States, the Court notes that the comparative survey of twenty-eight countries shows that, in sixteen of those countries, sentenced prisoners are not required to work after reaching retirement age. In the remaining twelve member States surveyed, the issue is not explicitly addressed in domestic law. However, these countries usually provide for exemptions from the requirement for prisoners to work, notably on account of their capacities and their age. Consequently, the arrangements put in place by these countries resemble the approach taken in Switzerland. The Court therefore concludes that, in the absence of sufficient consensus among the Council of Europe member States on the requirement for prisoners to work after they have reached retirement age, the Swiss authorities enjoyed a considerable margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132)."

Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, of “[a] ny relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see, among other authorities, Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, § 131, ECHR 2010, and Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 29, Series A no. 18).",
                "In this connection the Court observes that Rule 105.2 of the 2006 European Prison Rules (see paragraph 27 above) states that “[s] entenced prisoners who have not reached the normal retirement age may be required to work, subject to their physical and mental fitness as determined by the medical practitioner”.",
                "Although the aforementioned European Prison Rules do not have binding legal force, the Court has always attributed considerable importance to them in its case-law. In the case before it, it observes that the wording of Rule 105.2 is quite open and that it does not impose a uniform regime as regards the requirement for prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In any event, the Court considers that this Rule should not necessarily be interpreted as completely prohibiting the member States from requiring prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In the present case the Court does not deem it necessary to provide a definitive answer to this question, bearing in mind that the member States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation when it comes to implementation of this Rule by the prison authorities, who are in any event better placed than the Court to assess issues linked to conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners. In that regard the Court takes the view that it is primarily for the domestic authorities to establish effective and practicable conditions and arrangements with a view to organising their prison systems, while at the same time complying with the requirements of the Convention."

While the Court is aware of the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to the effect that educational facilities should be made available to all prisoners (see paragraphs 21-24 above), it reiterates that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 does not place an obligation on Contracting States to organise educational facilities for prisoners where such facilities are not already in place (see Natoli v. Italy, no. 26161/95, Commission decision of 18 May 1998, unreported, and Epistatu v. Romania, no. 29343/10, § 63, 24 September 2013 ). However, the present applicant ’ s complaint concerns the refusal to him of access to a pre-existing educational institution, namely the Stara Zagora Prison school. As noted above, the right of access to pre-existing educational institutions falls within the scope of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1. Any limitation on this right has, therefore, to be foreseeable, to pursue a legitimate aim and to be proportionate to that aim (see paragraph 32 above). Although Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 does not impose a positive obligation to provide education in prison in all circumstances, where such a possibility is available it should not be subject to arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions."

            [
                "35. The Court finds it open to doubt whether the restriction on the applicant was sufficiently foreseeable for the purposes of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1. The relevant legislative framework provided that convicted prisoners aged 16 or older had a right, on request, to be included in educational programmes and that, in the absence of clear rules to the contrary, the provisions regarding convicted prisoners were to apply equally to remand prisoners. The only express provision relating to the rights of remand prisoners to education was to the effect that the prison authorities should “encourage” the participation of remand prisoners in prison educational programmes (see paragraphs 15-19 above)."

            [
                "36. The lack of clarity in the statutory framework was reflected in the fact that during the domestic proceedings and the proceedings before this Court, varied reasons were given by the national authorities for refusing the applicant ’ s request to enrol in the school. His request was refused by the Execution of Punishments Directorate of the Ministry of Justice on the ground that “once convicted”, he would be transferred to a prison for “ recidivists ”, and that in the meantime it would breach the statutory requirement to keep “ recidivist ” and “ non-recidivist ” prisoners apart if he were allowed to mix with “ non-recidivists ” in the prison school (see paragraph 7 above). Subsequently, the prison governor also refused his request on similar grounds (see paragraph 8 above). When the applicant appealed against the decision of the prison authorities to exclude him from the school, the Stara Zagora Regional Court found that he could not be classified as a “ recidivist ” and ordered the prison governor to admit him to the school. On the further appeal of the prison governor, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the Regional Court ’ s judgment on the ground that the applicant was not entitled to take part in the prison ’ s educational programme because the right to education was envisaged by the relevant legislation as applying solely in regard of persons deprived of liberty as a result of a final conviction and not in regard of those detained on remand (see paragraph 12 above)."
            ],
            [
                "37. In addition, during the proceedings before this Court, the Government relied on three different grounds to justify the applicant ’ s exclusion from the school. Firstly, they contended that, as a remand prisoner, it was not appropriate that he should attend school with convicted prisoners. Secondly, they argued that, as a remand prisoner serving an indeterminate period of pre-trial detention, it was inappropriate for him to attend the school which was intended for convicted prisoners serving terms of imprisonment of twelve months or more. Thirdly, they reasoned that since the applicant risked being sentenced as a “ recidivist ”, it would not have been in the interests of the convicted, “ non-recidivist ” prisoners attending the school for the applicant to have been allowed to attend."

            [
                "38. For the Court, it is noteworthy that the Government have not supported their arguments with any evidence relating to the conditions applicable in Stara Zagora Prison. The need to protect the applicant by keeping him apart from convicted prisoners, because of his status as a remand prisoner, was not a ground relied on by the prison authorities in rejecting the applicant ’ s requests. Moreover, it was clear from the applicant ’ s many requests to be allowed to attend the school that he had no objection to participating in this activity together with convicted prisoners. In the material before the Court, there is no evidence to show that remand prisoners would have come to any harm within the controlled and supervised environment of the classroom or that remand prisoners were detained separately from convicted or “ recidivist ” prisoners within Stara Zagora Prison and, if so, whether this segregation applied to all aspects of the regime within the prison."
            ],
            [
                "39. The second ground relied on by the Government was the indeterminate nature of detention on remand and the requirement in national law for prisoners to be serving sentences of one year or more before being able to enrol in prison schools. However, the Government have not explained why this was a necessary condition for admission to a prison school. With regard, specifically, to remand prisoners such as the applicant, the Court does not consider that the fact that the ultimate length of their pre ‑ trial detention is uncertain at the start should be used as a justification for depriving them of access to educational facilities, save perhaps in cases where it is clear for some reason that the detention will be of short duration. Moreover, the Government have not provided the Court with any statistical information as regards the availability of resources at the school such as to justify, for example, a policy of concentrating limited resources on those prisoners serving the longest sentences."
            ],
            [
                "40. Finally, with regard to the last ground relied on by the Government, namely the need to keep the applicant apart from other prisoners because of the risk that he would be sentenced as a “ recidivist ”, the Court does not consider this was a legitimate reason, since during the time in question he was an unconvicted prisoner and entitled to the presumption of innocence."

The Court does not, therefore, consider any of the grounds relied on by the Government to be persuasive, particularly as they are unsupported by any evidence relating to the precise modalities of providing access to education at the Stara Zagora Prison school. On the other side of the balance must be set the applicant ’ s undoubted interest in completing his secondary education. The value of providing education in prison, both in respect of the individual prisoner and the prison environment and society as a whole, has been recognised by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in its Recommendations on education in prison and on the European Prison Rules (see paragraphs 21-24 above)."

In the applicant ’ s opinion the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 (see paragraphs 15- 18 below) imposed the same obligation on the authorities to provide access to education to prisoners detained on remand as the obligation to provide such access to sentenced prisoners. The refusal pursued no legitimate aim and was contrary to the National Education Act 1991 and the United Nations Convention against Discrimination in Education (published in the Official Gazette in 1963). During the hearing he indicated that other persons in his situation were allowed to study and that the prison authorities had not shown any legal ground for their refusal. The prison governor admitted that there had previously been a practice of providing access to the school, but that this had been discontinued because of concerns about the influence of “ recidivists ” on “ non-recidivists ”. The applicant had been refused access as he was to be treated as a “recidivist” within the meaning of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 (see paragraph 20 below) and could not attend the school because this would bring him into contact with non-recidivists."

The court held that the applicant could not be considered a “recidivist”, as defined by section 158 of the Execution of Punishments Act because, although he had previously received a sentence of imprisonment, the current set of proceedings against him were still pending and he had not yet been convicted and sentenced a second time.

The current provision envisaged mandatory education only for persons under the age of 16; for those aged 16 and over there was an obligation on the State to make education available for prisoners who wished to take part.

In particular, in his view, the provisions regarding access to educational facilities by convicted prisoners should have been applied to all detainees. In his submission, the domestic authorities construed the relevant provisions wrongly and as a result treated him in a discriminatory manner, restricted his rights more than was necessary for the purposes of his detention, and automatically and arbitrarily deprived him of his right to education."

The applicant also objected to the ground relied on by the prison authorities and by the Government in their observations, namely that as a person likely to be sentenced as a “ recidivist ”, it was justifiable to exclude him from the school in the interests of the “ non-recidivists ” who attended it. He pointed out that during the period he was detained at Stara Zagora there were convicted prisoners classified as “ recidivists ” who attended the prison school. In his submission, this demonstrated that the principle of separating “ recidivists ” from other prisoners had not been respected. Furthermore, the applicant reasoned that it was illogical to exclude him from the school on the ground that, as an unconvicted prisoner, there was a chance that he would be acquitted and have to leave before the completion of the school year. In the event, he spent almost two full school years in pre-trial detention at Stara Zagora Prison. Had the prison authorities had any doubt concerning the duration of his detention on remand, they could have made inquiries of the Prosecutor ’ s Office. The applicant contended that, until convicted, he was entitled to the presumption of innocence and should not have been denied his right to education during this period. Once he was convicted, and moved to Pazardjik Prison, he was unable to pursue his education because there was no school at that prison."

                "29. The Government contended that, in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, it was for the domestic authorities to regulate and plan educational facilities in their country. The decision by the prison authorities to exclude the applicant from the prison school was reasonable, given the need to apply different standards and conditions in relation to different categories of prisoner. The applicant ’ s detention at Stara Zagora Prison, an open prison designed primarily for “ non-recidivist ” convicted prisoners, was exceptional and, at the time, it was unclear how long he would continue to be detained there. Firstly, the Government argued that as a remand prisoner it was not appropriate that the applicant should attend school with convicted prisoners. Moreover, under the provisions of the Execution of Punishments Act as applicable at the time, remand prisoners were not allowed to enrol in prison school unless it was certain that they would remain at the prison for at least one school year. Secondly, as a remand prisoner who risked being sentenced as a “ recidivist ” following conviction, it was appropriate that the rules on “ recidivist ” prisoners should be applied to him (see paragraph 20 above). If this were not so, the prison authorities would not be able fully to protect “ non-recidivist ” prisoners from contact with “ recidivists ”. In addition, a relaxation of the rules applying to “ recidivists ” would weaken the deterrent effect of imprisonment. Had the applicant subsequently been acquitted, he would immediately have been released and his exclusion from the prison school would have ceased to affect him. Finally, the Government emphasised that, following his transfer to the prison in the town of Pazardzhik, the applicant did not submit a request to take part in the educational activities there."

The Court would begin by emphasising that prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention, save for the right to liberty, where lawfully imposed detention expressly falls within the scope of Article 5 of the Convention. For example, prisoners may not be ill-treated, subjected to inhuman or degrading punishment or conditions contrary to Article 3 of the Convention; they continue to enjoy the right to respect for family life, the right to freedom of expression, the right to practise their religion, the right of effective access to a lawyer or to a court for the purposes of Article 6, the right to respect for correspondence and the right to marry. Any restrictions on these other rights must be justified, although such justification may well be found in the considerations of security, in particular the prevention of crime and disorder, which inevitably flow from the circumstances of imprisonment (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 69, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX, and the cases cited therein; see also Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 99, ECHR 2011 ). In Hirst ( cited above, § 70) the Court stated that “[t] here is no question ... that a prisoner forfeits his Convention rights merely because of his status as a person detained following conviction ”. This principle applies a fortiori in respect of a person such as the applicant during the period in question, who has not been convicted and who must, therefore, be presumed innocent (see, for example, Laduna v. Slovakia, no. 31827/02, §§ 64 and 67, ECHR 2011 )."

As regards the right to education, while Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be interpreted as imposing a duty on the Contracting State to set up or subsidise particular educational establishments, any State doing so will be under an obligation to afford effective access to them. Put differently, access to educational institutions existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right set out in the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (see Case “relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” (merits), 23 July 1968, pp. 7-8, §§ 3-4, Series A no. 6; Ponomaryovi v. Bulgaria, no. 5335/05, § 49, ECHR 2011; and Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], nos. 43370/04, 8252/05 and 18454/06, § 137, ECHR 2012 ). This provision applies to primary, secondary and higher levels of education (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 134 and 136, ECHR 2005-XI)."

            [
                "32. The Court however recognises that, in spite of its importance, the right to education is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations. Provided that there is no injury to the substance of the right, these limitations are permitted by implication since the right of access “by its very nature calls for regulation by the State”. In order to ensure that the restrictions that are imposed do not curtail the right in question to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness, the Court must satisfy itself that they are foreseeable for those concerned and pursue a legitimate aim. However, unlike the position with respect to Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, it is not bound by an exhaustive list of “legitimate aims” under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1. Furthermore, a limitation will be compatible with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 only if there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved. Although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Catan and Others, cited above, § 140, and the cases cited therein )."

It is also true that in deciding how to regulate access to education, a State must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the educational needs of those under its jurisdiction and, on the other, its limited capacity to accommodate them. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, unlike some other public services, education is a right that enjoys direct protection under the Convention. It is also a very particular type of public service, which not only directly benefits those using it but also serves broader societal functions. Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to point out that “[ i ]n a democratic society, the right to education ... is indispensable to the furtherance of human rights [and] plays ... a fundamental role...” ( see, mutatis mutandis, Ponomaryovi, cited above, § 55 ).",

While the Court is aware of the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to the effect that educational facilities should be made available to all prisoners (see paragraphs 21-24 above), it reiterates that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 does not place an obligation on Contracting States to organise educational facilities for prisoners where such facilities are not already in place (see Natoli v. Italy, no. 26161/95, Commission decision of 18 May 1998, unreported, and Epistatu v. Romania, no. 29343/10, § 63, 24 September 2013 ). However, the present applicant ’ s complaint concerns the refusal to him of access to a pre-existing educational institution, namely the Stara Zagora Prison school. As noted above, the right of access to pre-existing educational institutions falls within the scope of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1. Any limitation on this right has, therefore, to be foreseeable, to pursue a legitimate aim and to be proportionate to that aim (see paragraph 32 above). Although Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 does not impose a positive obligation to provide education in prison in all circumstances, where such a possibility is available it should not be subject to arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions."

The relevant legislative framework provided that convicted prisoners aged 16 or older had a right, on request, to be included in educational programmes and that, in the absence of clear rules to the contrary, the provisions regarding convicted prisoners were to apply equally to remand prisoners. The only express provision relating to the rights of remand prisoners to education was to the effect that the prison authorities should “encourage” the participation of remand prisoners in prison educational programmes (see paragraphs 15-19 above)."

The lack of clarity in the statutory framework was reflected in the fact that during the domestic proceedings and the proceedings before this Court, varied reasons were given by the national authorities for refusing the applicant ’ s request to enrol in the school. His request was refused by the Execution of Punishments Directorate of the Ministry of Justice on the ground that “once convicted”, he would be transferred to a prison for “ recidivists ”, and that in the meantime it would breach the statutory requirement to keep “ recidivist ” and “ non-recidivist ” prisoners apart if he were allowed to mix with “ non-recidivists ” in the prison school (see paragraph 7 above). Subsequently, the prison governor also refused his request on similar grounds (see paragraph 8 above). When the applicant appealed against the decision of the prison authorities to exclude him from the school, the Stara Zagora Regional Court found that he could not be classified as a “ recidivist ” and ordered the prison governor to admit him to the school. On the further appeal of the prison governor, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the Regional Court ’ s judgment on the ground that the applicant was not entitled to take part in the prison ’ s educational programme because the right to education was envisaged by the relevant legislation as applying solely in regard of persons deprived of liberty as a result of a final conviction and not in regard of those detained on remand (see paragraph 12 above)."

            [
                "37. In addition, during the proceedings before this Court, the Government relied on three different grounds to justify the applicant ’ s exclusion from the school. Firstly, they contended that, as a remand prisoner, it was not appropriate that he should attend school with convicted prisoners. Secondly, they argued that, as a remand prisoner serving an indeterminate period of pre-trial detention, it was inappropriate for him to attend the school which was intended for convicted prisoners serving terms of imprisonment of twelve months or more. Thirdly, they reasoned that since the applicant risked being sentenced as a “ recidivist ”, it would not have been in the interests of the convicted, “ non-recidivist ” prisoners attending the school for the applicant to have been allowed to attend."

The need to protect the applicant by keeping him apart from convicted prisoners, because of his status as a remand prisoner, was not a ground relied on by the prison authorities in rejecting the applicant ’ s requests. Moreover, it was clear from the applicant ’ s many requests to be allowed to attend the school that he had no objection to participating in this activity together with convicted prisoners. In the material before the Court, there is no evidence to show that remand prisoners would have come to any harm within the controlled and supervised environment of the classroom or that remand prisoners were detained separately from convicted or “ recidivist ” prisoners within Stara Zagora Prison and, if so, whether this segregation applied to all aspects of the regime within the prison."

            [
                "39. The second ground relied on by the Government was the indeterminate nature of detention on remand and the requirement in national law for prisoners to be serving sentences of one year or more before being able to enrol in prison schools. However, the Government have not explained why this was a necessary condition for admission to a prison school. With regard, specifically, to remand prisoners such as the applicant, the Court does not consider that the fact that the ultimate length of their pre ‑ trial detention is uncertain at the start should be used as a justification for depriving them of access to educational facilities, save perhaps in cases where it is clear for some reason that the detention will be of short duration. Moreover, the Government have not provided the Court with any statistical information as regards the availability of resources at the school such as to justify, for example, a policy of concentrating limited resources on those prisoners serving the longest sentences."

Finally, with regard to the last ground relied on by the Government, namely the need to keep the applicant apart from other prisoners because of the risk that he would be sentenced as a “ recidivist ”, the Court does not consider this was a legitimate reason, since during the time in question he was an unconvicted prisoner and entitled to the presumption of innocence."

On the other side of the balance must be set the applicant ’ s undoubted interest in completing his secondary education. The value of providing education in prison, both in respect of the individual prisoner and the prison environment and society as a whole, has been recognised by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in its Recommendations on education in prison and on the European Prison Rules (see paragraphs 21-24 above)."

A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( Burden, cited above, § 60; and Carson, cited above, § 61). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006).

The Government considered that the measure in the present case was justified on the basis of the risk posed by the category of prisoners in question and the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system. As to the latter, as the Court noted in Stafford, cited above, § 80, it is not apparent how public confidence in the system of criminal justice could legitimately require the continued incarceration of a prisoner who has served the term required for punishment for the offence and is no longer a risk to the public. However, the Court considers that more stringent early release provisions in respect of some prisoners may be justified where it can be demonstrated that those to whom they apply pose a higher risk to the public upon release. The Court therefore accepts that in principle such differences in treatment between groups of prisoners pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the public."

In respect of the difference in treatment between prisoners serving determinate sentences of fifteen years or more and those serving indeterminate sentences, the Court observes that the imposition of a determinate sentence rather than an indeterminate sentence would appear to indicate that the individual in question poses a lower, and not a higher, risk upon release. The Court has found that only considerations of risk could justify the imposition of different early release requirements in the present case (see paragraph 74 above). Given the apparently greater risk posed by life prisoners, the Court is of the view that a system which imposes on them less stringent conditions for early release while prisoners serving fixed-term sentences of fifteen years or more are subject to more stringent conditions appears to lack any objective justification. In this regard, the requirements of Article 5 § 4 concerning the right of life prisoners to have their initial release determined by a judicial body cannot provide the justification for treating long-term prisoners less favourably."

The Court accepts in principle that the application of more stringent early release provisions may have to be dependent on a bright-line cut - off point and considers that such a bright-line distinction will not of itself fall foul of the Convention (see Twizell v. the United Kingdom, no. 25379/02, § 24, 20 May 2008; Amato Gauci v.

Lord Bingham of Cornhill noted (at paragraphs 17-18):",

Prisoners may, consistently with the Convention, be required to serve every day of the sentence passed by the judge, or be detained until a predetermined period or proportion of the sentence has been served, if that is what domestic law provides. But this is not what the law of England and Wales provided, in respect of long-term determinate prisoners, at the times relevant to these appeals. That law provided for a time at which (subject to additional days of custody imposed for disciplinary breaches) a prisoner must, as a matter of right, be released, and an earlier time at which he might be released if it was judged safe to release him but at which he need not be released if it was not so judged.",
                "A number of grounds (economy and the need to relieve over-crowding in prisons) have doubtless been relied on when introducing pre-release schemes from determinate sentences such as those under consideration here. But one such consideration is recognition that neither the public interest nor the interest of the offender is well served by continuing to detain a prisoner until the end of his publicly pronounced sentence; that in some cases those interests will be best served by releasing the prisoner at the earlier, discretionary, stage; and that in those cases prisoners should regain their freedom (even if subject to restrictions) because there is judged to be no continuing interest in depriving them of it. I accordingly find that the right to seek early release, where domestic law provides for such a right, is clearly within the ambit of article 5, and differential treatment of one prisoner as compared with another, otherwise than on the merits of their respective cases, gives rise to a potential complaint under article 14. ”"

But here Mr Clift does not complain of the sentence passed upon him, but of being denied a definitive Parole Board recommendation. Is his classification as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of 15 years or more (but less than life) a personal characteristic? I find it difficult to apply so elusive a test. But I would incline to regard a life sentence as an acquired personal characteristic and a lifer as having an'other status', and it is hard to see why the classification of Mr Clift, based on the length of his sentence and not the nature of his offences, should be differently regarded. I think, however, that a domestic court should hesitate to apply the Convention in a manner not, as I understand, explicitly or impliedly authorised by the Strasbourg jurisprudence, and I would accordingly, not without hesitation, resolve this question in favour of the Secretary of State and against Mr Clift.”"

                "“It could be said in Mr Clift's case that the length of his sentence did confer a status on him which can be regarded as a personal characteristic. This is because prisoners are divided by the domestic system into broadly defined categories, or groups of people, according to the nature or the length of their sentences. These categories affect the way they are then dealt with throughout the period of their sentences. As a result they are regarded as having acquired a distinctive status which attaches itself to them personally for the purposes of the regime in which they are required to serve their sentences. This is most obviously so in the case of prisoners serving life sentences and where distinctions are drawn between short-term and long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences. It is less obviously so in the case of long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences of different lengths.",

It is plain too that the category of long-term prisoner into which Mr Clift's case falls would not have been recognised as a separate category had it not been for the Order which treats prisoners in his group differently from others in the enjoyment of their fundamental right to liberty. But he had already been sentenced, and he had already acquired the status which that sentence gave him before the Order was made that denied prisoners in his group the right to release on the recommendation of the Parole Board. The question which his case raises is whether the distinguishing feature or characteristic which enables persons or a group of persons to be singled out for separate treatment must have been identified as a personal characteristic before it is used for this purpose by the discriminator.",

This suggests that a generous meaning should be given to the words'or other status'while recognising, of course, that the proscribed grounds are not unlimited. It seems to me, on this approach, that the protection of article 14 ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons or groups of persons differently in the enjoyment of their Convention rights had not previously been recognised.",

A measure of self-restraint is needed, lest we stretch our own jurisprudence beyond that which is shared by all the States Parties to the Convention.

The same would surely apply to a difference in treatment based on race, sex or the colour of one's hair.

This one is the result of what the Home Secretary chose to do in relation to people sentenced to shorter terms of imprisonment and what he was obliged by the terms of article 5 itself to do in relation to life imprisonment. The law has since been changed and one can well understand why.

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention and to this extent it is autonomous (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 40, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 159, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...; and Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 63, 16 March 2010 ). A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe the Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature (see, for example, the Belgian linguistic case (merits), 23 July 1968, § 9, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-34). Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable it suffices that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 39, ECHR 2005-X; and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 40, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... )."

                "45. First, relying on Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23, the Government argued that the words “other status” should be construed ejusdem generis with the other grounds listed in Article 14."
            ],

                "46. Second, relying on Gerger, cited above, § 69, and Taxquet v. Belgium, no. 926/05, § 87, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts) (currently pending before the Grand Chamber), the Government contended that the consistent jurisprudence of the Court, in application of Gerger, was that differences of treatment based on different laws providing for criminal penalties and procedures, being necessarily impersonal, fell outside the scope of Article 14 (see, for example, Budak and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57345/00, 7 September 2004; and Yılmaz and Barım v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47874/99, 26 May 2005). In particular, the Court had held in Gerger that differences in treatment between prisoners in relation to parole would not give rise to “other status” where the difference in treatment was based on the legislature's view of the gravity of the offence. In the present case, the Government argued that the difference in treatment was a consequence of the view taken by the legislature of the gravity of the offence: for offences so serious that they justified a determinate sentence of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the legislature had agreed that the Secretary of State should decide on possible release on licence, by contrast with less serious offences attracting sentences of less than fifteen years. In this regard, the Government disagreed with the applicant's submission that the Court in Gerger had considered the justification for the difference in treatment in deciding that there was no evidence of discrimination. In the Government's view, it was clear that the Court was applying the “personal characteristic” principle in order to assess whether the difference of treatment complained of fell within the meaning of “other status”."
            ],
            [
                "47. Third, the Government submitted that the treatment about which the applicant complained had to exist independently of the personal characteristic upon which he based his complaint of discrimination. Otherwise the very matter complained of would bring the complaint within the scope of Article 14 which would render the limitation on the scope of Article 14 nugatory (citing Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42639/04, 13 September 2005). The Government argued that to the extent that the applicant sought to compare himself to prisoners serving determinate sentences of less than fifteen years, this difference did not exist independently of the matter of which he complained. The length of the sentence had as such no relevance to the law that governed how a prisoner served his sentence, although the Government accepted that being a prisoner could constitute “other status” for the purpose of Article 14."
            ],
            [
                "48. Finally, as a specific manifestation of their third submission, the Government argued that where measures imposed to safeguard Convention rights did not apply outside the scope of those Convention rights, this difference could not itself bring a case within the scope of Article 14. To find otherwise would render nugatory the limit on Article 14. By way of example, the Government cited Article 5 § 4: in the case of a determinate sentence, that Article was satisfied by the sentencing exercise carried out by the trial court. The argument that, because Article 5 § 4 does not require a review of a determinate sentence prisoner's continuing detention, whereas it does require a review of the lawfulness of the continuing detention of a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence, the determinate sentence itself constitutes “ status ” was, in the Government's view, circular."
            ],
            [
                "49. For these reasons, the Government concluded that any extension of Article 14 in the manner called for by the applicant would be contrary to the language of that provision and the principles that underlay it, as well as the Court's consistent jurisprudence. They further pointed out that the House of Lords had unanimously found that the length of the applicant's sentence was not “other status”. The Government therefore invited the Court to find that Article 14 did not apply in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "50. The applicant contended that the different treatment of different categories of prisoners depending on the sentences imposed was based on “other status” within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention. He contested the Government's submission that only a status which met the requirement of being obviously analogous to one of the specific examples listed in Article 14 could constitute “other status” within the meaning of that Article. He argued that account should be taken of the purpose of the Convention, namely that it was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (citing Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, § 53). Accordingly, the words “other status” should not be so strictly construed as to undermine the purposes of the Convention, as set out in its preamble where it states its aim of “securing the universal and effective recognition of rights” and reflected in Article 1 of the Convention. Relying on Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, § 28, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX and Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 72, Series A no. 22, the applicant argued that there was a need for a wide construction of Article 14, and that the categories expressly set out in that provision were illustrative and not exhaustive. He further referred to the French text, which does not mention “status” but “situation” ( “ toute autre situation ” ) and argued that this supported his argument for a wider construction."
            ],
            [
                "51. The applicant further submitted that in any case not all the expressly listed grounds of prohibited discrimination in Article 14 fell within the notion of “personal characteristic”. He pointed to the inclusion of the word “property” in the list and the Court's conclusion in Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ III that the different treatment of landowners based on the size of the property they owned was discriminatory and in breach of Article 14. Accordingly, the applicant concluded that even if a ejusdem generis construction were to be considered appropriate, this would not lead to a limitation of the scope of Article 14 based on personal characteristics. The applicant further referred to a number of cases in which he claimed that the Court had found Article 14 to be applicable without insisting on a “personal characteristic” (citing, inter alia, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ IV; National Union of Belgian Police v. Belgium, 27 October 1975, Series A no. 19; Larkos v. Cyprus [GC], no. 29515/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; and Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). He further pointed out that being a prisoner has previously been found by the Court to constitute “status” (see Shelley v. the United Kingdom, no. 23800/06, 4 January 2008 ) and argued that the correct test for deciding whether Article 14 applied was whether there was a distinct legal situation which was inextricably bound up with the individual's personal circumstances and existence. In the applicant's case, he was a member of a group to whom a differential legal regime applied, which was a regime that controlled his release into society and his relationships with his family, which were clearly matters of personal circumstances and existence."
            ],
            [
                "52. As to the Government's submission that differences of treatment based on different laws providing criminal penalties and procedures were outside the scope of Article 14 because they were impersonal, the applicant reiterated that the test was not one of personal characteristics but personal circumstances. He disputed that Gerger was authority for the proposition that there was no “status” in his case, arguing that the Court's conclusion in Gerger was that there was no discrimination as a result of the differential treatment. The same was true of the other cases cited by the Government in support of their argument."
            ],
            [
                "53. The applicant also disputed that the treatment about which an applicant complained had to exist independently of the “status” upon which he relied. Provided that the relevant treatment fell within the scope of a Convention right, the failure to accord people equivalent treatment on the basis of their different circumstances could constitute a breach of Article 14. The applicant further insisted that the length of his sentence had significant consequences, including but not limited to, the different regime applicable to early release. For example, the length of his sentence also affected his prison security categorisation which in turn affected matters such as family contact."
            ],
            [
                "54. Accordingly, the applicant concluded that he had “other status” for the purposes of Article 14. His personal circumstances were affected by various aspects of the legal regime to which he was subjected by virtue of the length of his sentence. He further argued that the House of Lords did not reject his proposition that he enjoyed “other status” for the purposes of Article 14 but merely considered it appropriate to defer the question until the Court had had the opportunity to review the matter in full."
            ],
            [
                "55. Article 14 does not prohibit all differences in treatment but only those differences based on an identifiable, objective or personal characteristic, or “status”, by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from one another (see Kjeldsen Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, § 56; Berezovskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 70908/01, 15 June 2004; and Carson and Others, cited above, §§ 61 and 70 ). Article 14 lists specific grounds which constitute “status” including, inter alia, sex, race and property. However, the list set out in Article 14 is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words “any ground such as” (in French “ notamment ”) (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 72; and Carson, cited above, § 70) and the inclusion in the list of the phrase “any other status” (in French “ toute autre situation ”). In the present case, the treatment of which the applicant complains does not fall within one of the specific grounds listed in Article 14. In order for the applicant's complaint to be successful, he must therefore demonstrate that he enjoyed some “ other status” for the purpose of Article 14."
            ],
            [
                "56. The Court recalls that the words “other status” (and a fortiori the French “ toute autre situation ”) have generally been given a wide meaning ( see Carson, cited above, § 70). The Government have argued for a more limited interpretation, calling in particular for the words to be construed ejusdem generis with the specific examples listed in Article 14. The Court observes at the outset that while a number of the specific examples relate to characteristics which can be said to be “ personal ” in the sense that they are innate characteristics or inherently linked to the identity or the personality of the individual, such as sex, race and religion, not all of the grounds listed can be thus characterised. In this regard, the Court highlights the inclusion of property as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. This ground has been construed broadly by the Court: in James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 74, Series A no. 98, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained was between different categories of property owners; in Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25 088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, §§ 90 and 95, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, the difference was between large and small landowners. In both cases, the Court accepted that the provisions of Article 14 were applicable."
            ],
            [
                "57. As to its interpretation of “other status”, it is unsurprising that the Court has considered to constitute “ other status” characteristics which, like some of the specific examples listed in the Article, can be said to be personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent. Thus in Salgueiro da Silva Mouta, cited above, § 28, it found that sexual orientation was “undoubtedly covered” by Article 14 and in Glor v. Switzerland, no. 13444/04, § 80, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., it held that physical disabilities fell within the phrase “other status”."

            [
                "58. However, in finding violations of Article 14 in a number of other cases, the Court has accepted that “ status ” existed where the distinction relied upon did not involve a characteristic which could be said to be innate or inherent, and thus “personal” in the sense discussed above. In Engel and Others, cited above, the Court held that a distinction based on military rank could run counter to Article 14, the complaint in that case concerning a difference in treatment as regards provisional arrest between officers on the one hand and non-commissioned officers and ordinary servicemen on the other. In Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 64, Series A no. 222, the Court found a violation where there was a difference in treatment between the applicants and other holders of planning permissions in the same category as theirs. Although the Court did not specifically address the question of the relevant “status” in that case, it would appear that the distinction of which the applicants complained was between holders of outline planning permission who benefited from new legislation and holders of outline planning permission who did not (in that case, by virtue of the fact that the applicants'planning complaint had already been determined by the Court and that the outline planning permission had been found to be invalid – see § 26 of the judgment ). In Larkos v. Cyprus, cited above, § 21, where the Court found a violation of Article 14 as a result of a distinction between tenants of the State on the one hand and tenants of private landlords on the other, the parties did not dispute that Article 14 applied and the Court saw no reason to hold otherwise. In Shelley, cited above, the Court considered that being a convicted prisoner could fall within the notion of “ other status” in Article 14. In Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, cited above, again the Court did not specifically address the question of “ other status” but in finding a violation of Article 14 and Article 8 implicitly accepted that status as a former KGB officer fell within Article 14. Most recently, in Paulík v. Slovakia, no. 10699/05, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI (extracts), the Court accepted that the applicant, a father whose paternity had been established by judicial determination, had a resulting “status” which could be compared to putative fathers and mothers in situations where paternity was legally presumed but not judicially determined."

                "59. The Court therefore considers it clear that while it has consistently referred to the need for a distinction based on a “personal ” characteristic in order to engage Article 14, as the above review of its case-law demonstrates, the protection conferred by that Article is not limited to different treatment based on characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent. Accordingly, even if, as the Government contended, a ejusdem generis construction were appropriate in the present case, this would not necessarily preclude the distinction upon which the applicant relies."

                "60. Further, the Court is not persuaded that the Government's argument that the treatment of which the applicant complains must exist independently of the “other status” upon which it is based finds any clear support in its case-law. In Paulík, cited above, there was no suggestion that the distinction relied upon had any relevance outside the applicant's complaint but this did not prevent the Court from finding a violation of Article 14. The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a personal or identifiable characteristic in any given case is a matter to be assessed taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37; and Cudak v. Lithuania [GC], no. 15869/02, § 36, 2 3 March 2010 ). It should be recalled in this regards that the general purpose of Article 14 is to ensure that where a State provides for rights falling within the ambit of the Convention which go beyond the minimum guarantees set out therein, those supplementary rights are applied fairly and consistently to all those within its jurisdiction unless a difference of treatment is objectively justified."

            [
                "61. The Government have relied in particular upon the Court's conclusion in Gerger, cited above, that the distinction in that case was made not between different groups of people but between different types of offence, according to the legislature's view of their gravity, to support their argument that the applicant is unable to demonstrate that he enjoyed “ other status ”. The Court observes that the approach adopted in Gerger has been followed in a number of cases, but all concerned special court procedures or provisions on early release for those accused or convicted of terrorism offences in Turkey (see, for example, Budak and Others, cited above; Yılmaz and Barım, cited above; Akbaba v. Turkey, no. 52656/99, § 28, 17 January 2006; and Tanrıkulu and Deniz v. Turkey, no. 60011/00, § 37, 18 April 2006). Thus while Gerger made it clear that there may be circumstances in which it is not appropriate to categorise an impugned difference of treatment as one made between groups of people, any exception to the protection offered by Article 14 of the Convention should be narrowly construed. In the present case the applicant does not allege a difference of treatment based on the gravity of the offence he committed, but one based on his position as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of more than fifteen years. While sentence length bears some relationship to the perceived gravity of the offence, a number of other factors may also be relevant, including the sentencing judge's assessment of the risk posed by the applicant to the public."

Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 104, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV ). Where an early release scheme applies differently to prisoners depending on the length of their sentences, there is a risk that, unless the difference in treatment is objectively justified, it will run counter to the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention.

The Court notes that the requirement to demonstrate an “analogous position” does not require that the comparator groups be identical. The fact that the applicant's situation is not fully analogous to that of shorter-term or life prisoners and that there are differences between the various groups does not preclude the application of Article 14 (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 15197/02, § 53, 22 May 2008 ).

The Court accordingly considers that, insofar as the assessment of the risk posed by a prisoner eligible for early release is concerned, there is no distinction to be drawn between long-term prisoners serving less than fifteen years, long-term prisoners serving fifteen years or more and life prisoners. The methods of assessing risk and the means of addressing any risk identified are in principle the same for all categories of prisoners."

He argued that the different treatment was not justified, in particular because it seemed likely that those sentenced to a discretionary life sentence rather than a determinate sentence were so sentenced because they were considered to pose a higher level of risk. To make such persons subject only to a recommendation of the Parole Board while requiring the lower-risk, determinate sentence prisoners to secure, in addition, the approval of the Secretary of State, lacked objective justification. He noted in this regard that the Government did not argue that the Secretary of State had a superior knowledge or ability than the Parole Board in assessing the matter of the risk he posed upon release.

In particular, it was justified for him to retain this discretion in respect of those prisoners serving the longest sentences. In this regard, the Government emphasised that the Secretary of State was accountable to Parliament for the operation of the prisons and for the criminal justice system as a whole and that Parliament had decided that the Secretary of State should continue to be responsible for the early release of long-term determinate sentence prisoners. Although the fifteen year mark was an arbitrary cut-off point, this was an area in which bright lines had to be drawn (citing James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 68, Series A no. 98; and Mellacher and Others v. Austria, 19 December 1989, §§ 52-53, Series A no. 169).

A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( Burden, cited above, § 60; and Carson, cited above, § 61). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006). While in principle a similar wide margin of appreciation applies in questions of prisoner and penal policy, the Court must nonetheless exercise close scrutiny where there is a complaint that domestic measures have resulted in detention which was arbitrary or unlawful."

The Government considered that the measure in the present case was justified on the basis of the risk posed by the category of prisoners in question and the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system. As to the latter, as the Court noted in Stafford, cited above, § 80, it is not apparent how public confidence in the system of criminal justice could legitimately require the continued incarceration of a prisoner who has served the term required for punishment for the offence and is no longer a risk to the public. However, the Court considers that more stringent early release provisions in respect of some prisoners may be justified where it can be demonstrated that those to whom they apply pose a higher risk to the public upon release. The Court therefore accepts that in principle such differences in treatment between groups of prisoners pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the public."

In respect of the difference in treatment between prisoners serving determinate sentences of fifteen years or more and those serving indeterminate sentences, the Court observes that the imposition of a determinate sentence rather than an indeterminate sentence would appear to indicate that the individual in question poses a lower, and not a higher, risk upon release. The Court has found that only considerations of risk could justify the imposition of different early release requirements in the present case (see paragraph 74 above). Given the apparently greater risk posed by life prisoners, the Court is of the view that a system which imposes on them less stringent conditions for early release while prisoners serving fixed-term sentences of fifteen years or more are subject to more stringent conditions appears to lack any objective justification. In this regard, the requirements of Article 5 § 4 concerning the right of life prisoners to have their initial release determined by a judicial body cannot provide the justification for treating long-term prisoners less favourably."

The differential treatment of prisoners serving fifteen years or more, whose release continued to be dependent on the decision of the Secretary of State, had become an indefensible anomaly, as the assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task which was at the relevant time recognised to have no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not, and did not claim to, bring any superior expertise (see paragraph 20 above)."
