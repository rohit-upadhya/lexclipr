As a rule, the fundamental criterion of fairness, including the equality of arms, is a constituent element of an effective remedy. A remedy cannot be considered effective unless the minimum conditions enabling an applicant to challenge a decision that restricts his or her rights under the Convention are provided. Moreover, the national authority that provides the remedy in question must be independent and capable of providing redress."

This group of prisoners will (or at least should, if the classification system is operating satisfactorily) represent a very small proportion of the overall prison population. However, it is a group that is of particular concern to the CPT, in view of the fact that the need to take exceptional measures concerning such prisoners brings with it a greater risk of inhuman treatment than is the case with the average prisoner.",

Human dignity is to be respected notwithstanding criminality or dangerousness and if human persons have to be imprisoned in circumstances of greater severity than the conventional, every effort should be made, subject to the requirements of safe custody, good order and security and the requirements of community well-being, to ensure that living environment and conditions offset the deleterious effects – decreased mental efficiency, depression, anxiety, aggressiveness, neurosis, negative values, altered biorhythms – of the severer custodial situation.

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour (see Labita v.

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 91, ECHR 2000-XI, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § 67, ECHR 2001-III). Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers, ibid., § 74)."

The Court has consistently stressed that, for Article 3 to come into play, the suffering involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with this provision the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well ‑ being are adequately secured (see Kudła v.

Italy ( dec .), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999 ‑ V). As stated by the CPT, however, all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have damaging effects, resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities (see Iorgov v.

It has thus observed that complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation, can destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason ( see Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], no. 59450/00, §§ 120 to 124, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and the authorities cited therein). In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness, substantive reasons must be given when a protracted period of solitary confinement is extended. The decision should thus make it possible to establish that the authorities have carried out a reassessment that takes into account any changes in the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons will need to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time goes by. Furthermore, such measures, which are a form of “imprisonment within the prison”, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006. A system of regular monitoring of the prisoner ’ s physical and mental condition should also be set up in order to ensure its compatibility with continued solitary confinement ( Ramirez Sanchez v.

He was excluded from activities with other prisoners but had access to television and newspapers, had language lessons, was able to meet the prison chaplain and received a visit once a week from his lawyer and some members of his family. In that case, the Court found no violation of Article 3 of the Convention."

He had no access to cultural activities and was kept handcuffed every time when outside his cell. Moreover, he served almost the entirety of his prison time in the “KBK” regime, entailing very harsh conditions including only artificial light in his cell, insufficient ventilation, a toilet without a seat or a cover as well as full cavity searches on a daily basis (see paragraphs 9 and 13 to 16 above). However, books, television and the services of the chaplain were available to him. Considering all these elements, the Court concludes that the applicant cannot be considered to have been in complete sensory isolation and that his isolation was partial and relative."

However, several of the restrictive measures applied to the applicant – such as the prohibition on possessing a watch or teabags or the restriction on the number of books kept in the cell (see paragraph 9 above) – cannot reasonably be related to the purported objective of the isolation, namely to frustrate attempted escape."

Italy (no. 2) ( dec. ), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999– V).

In the absence of reasoning, the impugned restriction must have been perceived as arbitrary. Arbitrary restrictive measures applied to vulnerable individuals like prisoners inevitably contribute to the feeling of subordination, total dependence, powerlessness and, consequently, humiliation. The authorities did not apply any measures to counter the negative effects of protracted solitary confinement on the applicant ’ s physical and mental condition. In the Court ’ s view, open air stays or sport opportunities, of limited availability, cannot under the present circumstances be considered as capable of remedying those negative effects, especially since all the movements of the applicant entailed handcuffing in an otherwise secure environment."

The Court thus concludes that the minimum level of severity required for Article 3 to come into play being attained, the applicant has been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment.

Secondly, an award of compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the ill ‑ treatment or death (see, for example, Gäfgen v.

Pursuant to the instructions of the Pecherskyy Court, which refused to institute civil proceedings, she resubmitted her claim under the rules of administrative procedure. While the first-instance court allowed her claim, the appellate court quashed that judgment on procedural grounds, holding that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the civil rather than the administrative courts, with this decision being upheld by the highest court more than five years after the applicant had lodged her claim (see paragraphs 46-54 above)."

[the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate “is not an obligation of result, but of means ”: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant ’ s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 71, ECHR 2002 ‑ II and Mahmut Kaya v.

Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 103 et seq., Reports 1998 ‑ VIII .). They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, etc. (see, mutatis mutandis, Salman v.

First of all, the applicants did not undergo forensic medical examinations until 6 July 2005, that is, over three years after the institution of the investigation. In cases concerning allegations of ill-treatment a medical examination to establish the gravity of the injuries, as well as when and how they were inflicted, is the most elemental step. It is crucial for the subsequent conduct of the investigation that it is carried out with utmost expedition, since any delay hinders the accuracy of its findings on account of healing of the injuries, thus affecting the evidentiary base available to the investigation. In the present case the failure to conduct the forensic medical examination for over three years, for which no explanation has been provided to the Court, is in itself liable to render the investigation inefficient."

The Court notes that after the commander of the detachment which had transferred the applicants to the Khankala military base had been identified, the military prosecuting authorities discontinued the investigation on the ground of the absence of corpus delicti, and the investigation conducted by the prosecuting authorities of Ingushetia was repeatedly suspended on the same ground.

Furthermore, according to the applicants, they were not notified of the UGA Prosecutor ’ s Office ’ s decision of 8 August 2003 not to institute criminal proceedings, and the Government submitted no evidence to the contrary. Having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, the applicants could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves on a number of occasions due to the need to take additional investigative measures. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants ’ allegations properly. Owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.

Paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Convention covers the former and paragraph 5 of Article 5 the latter.

                "The applicant’s son had a history of schizophrenia and was known to the health services. Having suffered a relapse of his psychotic symptoms, including voices telling him to kill himself, he was assessed as a low suicide risk and transferred as a voluntary patient by the NHS Trust to an ISMOS Unit for which the Council was responsible. At one point during the evening before he died, he was found wandering outside the ISMOS Unit and encouraged by staff to return, which he did. Moreover, the applicant’s son later broke a window in the Unit and fell to his death from the sixth floor of the building occupied by the Unit. The Coroner, concerned as he was about a psychiatric facility on a sixth floor, reported the incident to the NHS Trust under Rule 43 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984. The windows have since been reinforced and the long term plan is to transfer the ISMOS Unit to a two-storey building. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there is an arguable claim that the position of the applicant’s son was such that an operational duty arose to take reasonable steps to protect him from a real and immediate risk of suicide and that that duty was not fulfilled."

As to the compensatory remedies available, it is common ground that the Inquest, while constituting a detailed examination of the circumstances of the death, could not examine individual civil liability (paragraphs 15 and 27-28 above). It was not suggested that there was any question of criminal or disciplinary responsibility in the present case. The internal inquiry held was not independent, the NHS being responsible for the Trust."

                "63. As to an action under the HRA on which the Government first relied, the Court recalls that the applicant’s HRA action, alleging negligence and a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, was struck out under Rule 3.4 of the Civil Procedure Rules on the basis that she had no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim. The Government argued that this amounted to a rejection of the merits of her negligence case. The applicant maintained that the HRA action was a limited remedy which did not apply to her case.",
                "The Court recalls that the Court of Appeal had found in 2005, in the above-cited Takoushis case which concerned allegations of negligence as regards a voluntary mental health patient, that the Powell decision meant that the relevant Article 2 substantive responsibility was limited to cases where gross negligence or manslaughter was alleged. The Government suggested that Takoushis was not clear precedent because the core dispute therein concerned the investigatory duties under Article 2. However, the Court of Appeal in Takoushis explained why its view on the applicability and scope of Article 2 protection was important in that case and subsequent domestic courts did not treat as obiter the Takoushis ruling on the Powell substantive obligation under Article 2. On the contrary, the High Court in Savage later accepted that obligation as outlined in Takoushis and went on to apply it to a case concerning the death of an involuntary patient due to alleged negligence. The County Court therefore applied this case-law from two superior courts to the present applicant’s case (death of a voluntary patient due to alleged clinical negligence) and found it clear from that case-law that the parameters of the applicant’s case fell outside the scope of an action under the HRA alleging a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. Indeed the County Court considered the case-law to be so certain in these respects that an appeal in the Savage case did not raise sufficient prospects of success for the applicant’s case as to require it to be adjourned pending the Savage appeal. The applicant’s case was not therefore rejected as failing to disclose negligence but rather as not disclosing a cause of action under the HRA and, in particular, the County Court applied contemporary domestic case-law to the effect that she had no cause of action under the HRA about the allegedly negligent care and death of her son as he was a voluntary psychiatric in-patient.",
                "Moreover, the Court does not accept that any purpose would have been served by the applicant lodging an appeal immediately after the County Court decision if she considered it to be erroneous or by lodging an appeal thereafter on an out-of-time basis following the appeals in the Savage case. While the House of Lords in the Savage case (2008) later confirmed the existence of an Article 2 “operational duty” to suicide-risk patients, the Court of Appeal in Rabone found in 2010 that any such duty did not concern voluntary psychiatric patients. It was not until February 2012 that the Supreme Court in Rabone definitively confirmed that an operational duty to protect could arise as regards voluntary psychiatric patients such as the applicant’s son and, further, that parents would be entitled to damages for non-pecuniary loss following the death of a child in such a situation. Accordingly, while the underlying reasoning may have changed over the years, prior to February 2012 the applicant did not have an action for damages under the HRA for her non-pecuniary loss following the death of her son."

As to a civil action in negligence pursuant to the 1934 and 1976 Acts on which on which the Government further relied, it is noted that, in their written pleadings in the applicant’s HRA action, the Trust and Council accepted that they owed common law duties of care to the applicant’s son (paragraph 21 above)."

                "65. However, it is also noted that, as the mother of an adult child and a non-dependant, the applicant would have been unable to claim damages under the 1976 Act on her own behalf. Moreover, the Court does not consider that a negligence action on behalf of the estate of her son was available to the applicant even assuming she could have applied to be an executor of that estate and that any such award to his estate could constitute compensation for the applicant’s bereavement. The survival of any such action on behalf of the deceased and in favour of his estate is governed by the 1934 Act. Given the circumstances of the applicant’s son’s death (which was instantaneous), there is no evidence that he inflicted physical injury on himself before the moment of his death. While it is likely that he suffered significant anguish and fear, there is no evidence that this would be regarded as psychiatric “injury” in the sense recognised by domestic law. The most therefore that could be recovered under the 1934 Act on behalf of the deceased’s estate would have been the funeral expenses (as regards the 1976 and 1934 Acts, see the above-cited Keenan judgment, § 129 and Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, § 172, ECHR 2005 ‑ II).

His psychotic symptoms had therefore returned but he had stabilised rapidly as he had already re-taken his medication that morning. The voices had diminished and were not troubling him any more although he was terrified of their returning. During the assessment, he confirmed that he did not want to kill himself.

The claimant argued, citing Osman v. the United Kingdom (28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII), that a duty to take steps to prevent a particular patient from committing suicide arose if the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk of her doing so. The claimant sought to distinguish her son’s position (an involuntary patient) from that of a voluntary patient arguing that the test for Article 2 liability in Powell did not apply to her son and equating the duty of care owed by the State to an involuntary patient with that owed to a prisoner in the criminal justice system. The High Court expressly rejected that distinction, finding that the proper test applicable to a breach of the substantive obligation under Article 2, in respect of both voluntary and involuntary patients where the relevant allegations were of clinical negligence, was the Powell test namely, that of gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter (the High Court relied on the above-cited Takoushis judgment).

                "35. The appeal to the House of Lords was rejected by judgment dated 10 December 2008. Lord Rodger, giving the main judgment of the House of Lords, noted that the fundamental error in the approach of the Trust was to conceive of the Powell decision and the Osman judgment as laying down two mutually exclusive approaches whereas the Court’s case-law did not contain a hint of such an approach. The principles represented by those cases related to different aspects of the Article 2 obligations of health authorities and Lord Rodger summarised the relevant obligations of the health authorities under Article 2 as follows:",
                "“In terms of article 2, health authorities are under an over-arching obligation to protect the lives of patients in their hospitals. In order to fulfil that obligation, and depending on the circumstances, they may require to fulfil a number of complementary obligations.",
                "In the first place, the duty to protect the lives of patients requires health authorities to ensure that the hospitals for which they are responsible employ competent staff and that they are trained to a high professional standard. In addition, the authorities must ensure that the hospitals adopt systems of work which will protect the lives of patients. Failure to perform these general obligations may result in a violation of article 2. If, for example, a health authority fails to ensure that a hospital puts in place a proper system for supervising mentally ill patients and, as a result, a patient is able to commit suicide, the health authority will have violated the patient’s right to life under article 2.",
                "Even though a health authority employed competent staff and ensured that they were trained to a high professional standard, a doctor, for example, might still treat a patient negligently and the patient might die as a result. In that situation, there would be no violation of article 2 since the health authority would have done all that the article required of it to protect the patient’s life. Nevertheless, the doctor would be personally liable in damages for the death and the health authority would be vicariously liable for her negligence. This is the situation envisaged by Powell.",
                "The same approach would apply if a mental hospital had established an appropriate system for supervising patients and all that happened was that, on a particular occasion, a nurse negligently left his post and a patient took the opportunity to commit suicide. There would be no violation of any obligation under article 2, since the health authority would have done all that the article required of it. But, again, the nurse would be personally liable in damages for the death and the health authority would be vicariously liable too. Again, this is just an application of Powell.",
                "Finally, article 2 imposes a further “operational” obligation on health authorities and their hospital staff. This obligation is distinct from, and additional to, the authorities’ more general obligations. The operational obligation arises only if members of staff know or ought to know that a particular patient presents a “real and immediate” risk of suicide. In these circumstances article 2 requires them to do all that can reasonably be expected to prevent the patient from committing suicide. If they fail to do this, not only will they and the health authorities be liable in negligence, but there will also be a violation of the operational obligation under article 2 to protect the patient’s life. This is comparable to the position in Osman and Keenan. As the present case shows, if no other remedy is available, proceedings for an alleged breach of the obligation can be taken under the Human Rights Act 1998.”"

Plainly, patients, who have been detained because their health or safety demands that they should receive treatment in the hospital, are vulnerable ... not only by reason of their illness which may affect their ability to look after themselves, but also because they are under the control of the hospital authorities. Like anyone else in detention, they are vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, bullying and all the other potential dangers of a closed institution. Mutatis mutandis, the principles in the case law which the European court has developed for prisoners and administrative detainees must apply to patients who are detained. ...... The hospital authorities are accordingly responsible for the health and well being of their detained patients. Their obligations under Article 2 include an obligation to protect those patients from self-harm and suicide.”"

An informal psychiatric patient’s position was therefore more analogous to that of the child at risk of abuse ( Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ V).

As to an action under the HRA on which the Government first relied, the Court recalls that the applicant’s HRA action, alleging negligence and a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, was struck out under Rule 3.4 of the Civil Procedure Rules on the basis that she had no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim. The Government argued that this amounted to a rejection of the merits of her negligence case. The applicant maintained that the HRA action was a limited remedy which did not apply to her case.",
                "The Court recalls that the Court of Appeal had found in 2005, in the above-cited Takoushis case which concerned allegations of negligence as regards a voluntary mental health patient, that the Powell decision meant that the relevant Article 2 substantive responsibility was limited to cases where gross negligence or manslaughter was alleged. The Government suggested that Takoushis was not clear precedent because the core dispute therein concerned the investigatory duties under Article 2. However, the Court of Appeal in Takoushis explained why its view on the applicability and scope of Article 2 protection was important in that case and subsequent domestic courts did not treat as obiter the Takoushis ruling on the Powell substantive obligation under Article 2. On the contrary, the High Court in Savage later accepted that obligation as outlined in Takoushis and went on to apply it to a case concerning the death of an involuntary patient due to alleged negligence. The County Court therefore applied this case-law from two superior courts to the present applicant’s case (death of a voluntary patient due to alleged clinical negligence) and found it clear from that case-law that the parameters of the applicant’s case fell outside the scope of an action under the HRA alleging a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. Indeed the County Court considered the case-law to be so certain in these respects that an appeal in the Savage case did not raise sufficient prospects of success for the applicant’s case as to require it to be adjourned pending the Savage appeal. The applicant’s case was not therefore rejected as failing to disclose negligence but rather as not disclosing a cause of action under the HRA and, in particular, the County Court applied contemporary domestic case-law to the effect that she had no cause of action under the HRA about the allegedly negligent care and death of her son as he was a voluntary psychiatric in-patient.",
                "Moreover, the Court does not accept that any purpose would have been served by the applicant lodging an appeal immediately after the County Court decision if she considered it to be erroneous or by lodging an appeal thereafter on an out-of-time basis following the appeals in the Savage case. While the House of Lords in the Savage case (2008) later confirmed the existence of an Article 2 “operational duty” to suicide-risk patients, the Court of Appeal in Rabone found in 2010 that any such duty did not concern voluntary psychiatric patients. It was not until February 2012 that the Supreme Court in Rabone definitively confirmed that an operational duty to protect could arise as regards voluntary psychiatric patients such as the applicant’s son and, further, that parents would be entitled to damages for non-pecuniary loss following the death of a child in such a situation. Accordingly, while the underlying reasoning may have changed over the years, prior to February 2012 the applicant did not have an action for damages under the HRA for her non-pecuniary loss following the death of her son."

As to a civil action in negligence pursuant to the 1934 and 1976 Acts on which on which the Government further relied, it is noted that, in their written pleadings in the applicant’s HRA action, the Trust and Council accepted that they owed common law duties of care to the applicant’s son (paragraph 21 above)."

Moreover, the Court does not consider that a negligence action on behalf of the estate of her son was available to the applicant even assuming she could have applied to be an executor of that estate and that any such award to his estate could constitute compensation for the applicant’s bereavement. The survival of any such action on behalf of the deceased and in favour of his estate is governed by the 1934 Act. Given the circumstances of the applicant’s son’s death (which was instantaneous), there is no evidence that he inflicted physical injury on himself before the moment of his death. While it is likely that he suffered significant anguish and fear, there is no evidence that this would be regarded as psychiatric “injury” in the sense recognised by domestic law. The most therefore that could be recovered under the 1934 Act on behalf of the deceased’s estate would have been the funeral expenses (as regards the 1976 and 1934 Acts, see the above-cited Keenan judgment, § 129 and Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, § 172, ECHR 2005 ‑ II).

Taking into account also the unprovoked, violent and disproportionate assault by other individuals on the police officers, it is concluded that the police officers properly assessed the relevant circumstances and acted correctly.

The court accepted that the three police officers had feared for their physical integrity as a group of almost fifteen persons had hindered them, either physically or verbally, in their task of carrying out a normal police control. Finally, the court did not accept that the aggravating circumstances described in Article 167 § 2 of the Greek Criminal Code could be applied in the applicant's case (judgment no. 683/2005 )."

In that connection the Court notes that the latter established that the applicant had physically resisted his arrest. In particular, he had refused to comply with Officer Apostilidis's request to identify himself and had instead shoved him violently with his arm and subsequently violently pushed Officers Hamopoulos and Tsiorakis with his arms and feet.

In the Court's view, this is an important factor that could justify the firing of gunshots by Police Officer Apostolidis in order to intimidate them. However, the Court considers that acts of self-defence against the persons who ran out from the café could not, in the specific circumstances of the case, also justify the infliction of serious injuries on the applicant, who, by that time, was not the one threatening the physical integrity of the police officers. The Court considers that weight should be given in this respect to the significant difference in extent of the applicant's and the police officers'injuries: according to the medical reports and certificates, the former was hospitalized for five days and was expected to convalesce for eighteen to twenty - one days, whereas the three police officers, allegedly assaulted by a mob of ten to fifteen people, were admitted to hospital late on 23 February and were discharged the next day."

As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity ( see Assenov and Others v.

Nonetheless, the Court observes that the administrative inquiry included excerpts from the testimonies given mainly by the applicant, two of his acquaintances present at the scene and some other individuals accused of assaulting the police officers. It is also apparent from the relevant report that the agent based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. He thus observed, initially, that the violent behaviour transpired from the testimonies of the persons who had provoked the illegal acts. However, he did not consider these testimonies to be credible for two reasons: firstly, because they undoubtedly reflected personal opinions and assessments that would be of assistance to the accused during the trial; and secondly, because they could be considered as constituting defence tactics by the applicant's acquaintances, who were already facing grave criminal charges and whose depositions aimed to damage the credibility of the police officers. However, the administrative inquiry did accept as such the credibility of the police officers'testimonies by considering that “ not all the testimonies have been proven; on the contrary, the police officers (involved in the events) have denied them. The latter insisted in their testimonies that there had been no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians had been provoked before their transfer to the police station”. In the Court's view, the administrative inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies as those given by the civilians involved in the events were recognised as subjective but not those given by the police officers. However, the credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned as the administrative proceedings had also sought to establish whether they were liable on disciplinary grounds ( see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no. 46317/99, § 99, 23 February 2006)."

However, it drew a negative conclusion only in respect of the applicant as it accepted that this omission revealed the latter's intention to prevent the disclosure of new evidence facilitating the investigation of the case. As far as the police officers were concerned, it was accepted that “the disciplinary liability that derived from that omission was obvious in the present case but was of minor importance in the context of the case as a whole ”."

Secondly, the prosecuting authorities concluded that the applicant's allegations were “factually unfounded” by endorsing the testimonies given in the context of the judicial investigation carried out by the police.

Racial violence is a particular affront to human dignity and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of its enrichment ( see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 145, 6 July 2005)."

However, where it is alleged – as here – that a violent act was motivated by racial prejudice, such an approach would amount to requiring the respondent Government to prove the absence of a particular subjective attitude on the part of the person concerned. While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was racially motivated (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 157)."

A clear pattern of physical ill-treatment of prisoners by custodial staff emerged. The ill-treatment alleged consisted essentially of kicks, punches and truncheon blows to various parts of the body (excluding the face). The ill-treatment was said to have been inflicted principally in the central corridor of the detention facility, usually when prisoners were taken to an investigator's room for questioning or when they were returned to their cells after such questioning; apparently, prisoners were also on occasion physically ill-treated in the investigators'rooms. Investigators were said to have been fully aware of the ill treatment being inflicted, and some prisoners affirmed that it was inflicted at their instigation. In certain cases, the delegation has gathered medical evidence which is consistent with the allegations of ill-treatment made by the prisoners concerned.",

In the report on those two visits, the CPT recommended that the Russian authorities redouble their efforts to uncover and prosecute all cases of ill-treatment of persons deprived of their liberty in the Chechen Republic in the course of the conflict. The Committee made a number of remarks of a practical nature intended to clarify the precise form those efforts might take. More generally, the CPT stressed that it was essential for the Russian authorities to adopt a proactive approach in this area.",

                "As was stressed in a letter sent to the Russian authorities on 10 May 2001, the CPT's concerns in this regard are all the greater given that in the course of the Committee's most recent visit to the Chechen Republic, in March 2001, numerous credible and consistent allegations were once again received of severe ill-treatment by Federal forces; in a number of cases, those allegations were supported by medical evidence. The CPT's delegation found a palpable climate of fear; many people who had been ill-treated and others who knew about such offences were reluctant to file complaints to the authorities. There was the fear of reprisals at local level and a general sentiment that, in any event, justice would not be done.

Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective.

This avenue, however, had proved futile, as despite their very serious and detailed allegations, corroborated with medical documents, the authorities had remained passive and failed to act with sufficient dispatch and diligence in response to their complaints. No investigation had taken place and their complaints had been rejected without proper examination. Moreover, the authorities had refused to grant them access to the documents in the file or even to provide them with a copy of the decision of 7 January 2002, referring to the provisions of the old procedural legislation, even though at the moment of their request new legislation had been in force which granted them the possibility of receiving a copy of that decision. They had thus been deprived of any meaningful possibility of appealing against it in a court. Moreover, when the applicants had been in detention, their relatives had lodged numerous requests that criminal proceedings in connection with the applicants'unlawful detention, as well as the searches and seizure of their property, be instituted.

The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy, cited above, p. 2279, § 64; Aydın, cited above, pp. 1891-92, §§ 83-84 and 86; Selmouni, cited above, § 105; Dikme v.

Furthermore, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law that in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention. It observes that the requirements of an investigation and the undeniable difficulties inherent in the fight against crime cannot justify placing limits on the protection to be afforded in respect of the physical integrity of individuals (see Tomasi, cited above, p. 42, § 115, and Ribitsch, cited above, §§ 38-40)."

However, in a complaint of 14 March 2002 the applicants, acting through their representatives, challenged the said decision, referred to their original complaints and pointed out that the second applicant had been compelled to withdraw his allegations concerning ill-treatment (see paragraph 58 above). Against this background, the Court considers that the medical evidence and the applicants'complaints together raised a reasonable suspicion that their injuries could have been caused by representatives of the State and that the matter was duly brought before the competent authorities.

The Court notes in this connection that even though the applicants'complaints were dealt with by prosecutor's offices at two levels, the authorities never addressed the medical documents referred to by the applicants in support of their allegations. Moreover, the authorities failed to take a number of steps that appear essential for a proper conduct of the investigation. In particular, no attempts were made to order and carry out a forensic medical examination of the applicants, to inspect the scene of the incident or to identify and question officials who, at the material time, worked in the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD and Chernokozovo SIZO.

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 ( see, among other authorities, Çakıcı v.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions by the authorities of the respondent State (see Aydin, cited above, § 103).",

That was so because the applicable law treated as irrelevant the question whether or not the fiscal authorities made efforts to secure payment by other means, the debtor ’ s attitude and his or her potential ability to pay. The only grounds on which the travel ban could be lifted were payment, submission of sufficient security (apparently understood as security covering the full amount) or, as it happened in the event, extinction of the debt by prescription (see paragraphs 36, 37, 39 and 57-66 above). In these circumstances the travel ban was in reality an automatic measure of indefinite duration. The yearly “confirmations” were merely information notes certifying that the applicant had not paid, with the automatic consequence of the travel ban remaining in place, without examination of its justification and proportionality (see paragraph 41 above)."

The Court considers that the “automatic” nature of the travel ban ran contrary to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country should be justified and proportionate throughout its duration, in the individual circumstances of the case. It notes in this context that in the domestic law of a number of member states prohibitions against leaving the country for unpaid taxes can only be imposed if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person concerned would evade payment if allowed to travel abroad. Also, in a number of countries there are limitations on the duration of the restrictions (see paragraphs 73, 77-80 above). Regardless of the approach chosen, the principle of the proportionality must apply, in law and in practice. It did not in the present case."

National security was such a legitimate aim. Its protection had priority over the protection of individual rights and freedoms. Section 47 (1) of the Aliens Act took account of the fact that confidential information was at stake in deportation decisions based on national security.

Depriving aliens of any possibility of obtaining judicial review of a deportation decision was disproportionate.

Where an appeal against such an order is submitted to a court, it is not entitled to enquire whether genuine national security concerns are at stake and must reject it. In the applicants' case the same approach was adopted by the Ministry of the Interior, to which Mr Al-Nashif appealed (see paragraph 36 above)."

                "Where national security considerations are involved certain limitations on the type of remedies available to the individual may be justified. As regards secret surveillance and the use of secret information for screening job candidates who would have access to sensitive information, Article 13 requires a remedy “as effective as it can be”, having regard to the fact that it is inherent in any system of secret surveillance or secret checks that there would be a restricted scope for recourse (see the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, § 69, and the above cited Leander judgment, § 78). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. In particular, in the Klass and Leander cases, the applicants had possibilities of recourse with certain procedural guarantees and independent review. In the case of Amann v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 27798/95, ECHR 2000-II) the applicant could appeal to a court. In those cases no violation of Article 13 of the Convention was found.",

The Court considers that in cases of the expulsion of aliens on grounds of national security – as here – reconciling the interest of preserving sensitive information with the individual's right to an effective remedy is obviously less difficult than in the above-mentioned cases where the system of secret surveillance or secret checks could only function if the individual remained unaware of the measures affecting him.",
                "While procedural restrictions may be necessary to ensure that no leakage detrimental to national security would occur and while any independent authority dealing with an appeal against a deportation decision may need to afford a wide margin of appreciation to the executive in matters of national security, that can by no means justify doing away with remedies altogether whenever the executive has chosen to invoke the term “national security” (see the above cited Chahal judgment and paragraph 96 above on possible ways of reconciling the relevant interests involved).",
                "Even where an allegation of a threat to national security is made, the guarantee of an effective remedy requires as a minimum that the competent independent appeals authority must be informed of the reasons grounding the deportation decision, even if such reasons are not publicly available. The authority must be competent to reject the executive's assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it arbitrary or unreasonable. There must be some form of adversarial proceedings, if need be through a special representative after a security clearance. Furthermore, the question whether the impugned measure would interfere with the individual's right to respect for family life and, if so, whether a fair balance is struck between the public interest involved and the individual's rights must be examined."

Furthermore, Mr Al-Nashif had voluntarily abandoned teaching after service of the deportation order and would not be able to restart as new instructions issued by the Chief Mufti Office after his deportation prohibited religious instruction by persons lacking appropriate religious education.

The concept of lawfulness in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness ( see Rekvényi v.

However, the Court notes that, in line with the original decision, the domestic courts repeatedly found for the applicant in the ensuing proceedings for enforcement and fined the respondent Ministry. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the obstinate reluctance of the respondent State ’ s authorities to comply with the execution orders was in defiance of domestic law and tantamount to arbitrariness. The essentially obstructive character of this behaviour is also manifest in that it led to the finding of a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 3 9 above) from the perspective of the length of the proceedings. For the Court, such a misuse of the power vested in the authorities cannot be characterised as a measure “prescribed by law”.",

The Court considers that the obligation of States under that Article also encompasses a duty to ensure that the competent authorities enforce remedies when granted ( compare Article 2 § 3 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). For the Court, it would be inconceivable if Article 13 secured the right to a remedy, and provided for it to be effective, but did not guarantee the implementation of remedies used successfully. To hold the contrary would lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby, cited above, § 40)."
