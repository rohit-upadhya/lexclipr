                "37. The Court reiterates that the right to a court, of which the right of access is one aspect (see the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, § 36), is not absolute; it may be subject to limitations permitted by implication, particularly regarding the conditions of admissibility of an appeal (see the Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24–25, § 57). However, these limitations must not restrict exercise of the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. They must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see the Fayed v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 49–50, § 65; the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 78–79, § 59; the Bellet v. France judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 333-B, p. 41, § 31; and the Levages Prestations Services v.

                "This impairs the very essence of the right of appeal, by imposing a disproportionate burden on the appellant, thus upsetting the fair balance that must be struck between the legitimate concern to ensure that judicial decisions are enforced, on the one hand, and the right of access to the Court of Cassation and exercise of the rights of the defence on the other."

Such inadmissibility was not prescribed by law but had been introduced by case ‑ law and was contrary to the “presumption of innocence”, since it was based on the idea that the accused had deliberately sought to evade justice. In the present case, however, the applicant had never tried to withhold information about where he was living, which appeared in the Court of Appeal’s judgment convicting him and was perfectly well known to the police. In addition, there was no law which obliged him to attend the Court of Appeal in person on the day appointed for the reading of the judgment, five weeks after the hearing. As soon as he had learned of his conviction he had instructed his lawyer to lodge an appeal on points of law, and had then attempted to commit suicide. His family had thereupon had him admitted to a psychiatric clinic, where the arrest warrant was enforced three weeks later. In the present case, therefore, the sanction was disproportionate to the public-policy requirements relied on."

The Government submitted that the Court of Cassation’s ruling that the applicant’s appeal was inadmissible satisfied the criteria laid down by the Court’s case-law, in so far as the limitation concerned did not “restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right [was] impaired”. Access to the Court of Cassation was not denied to an absconding defendant but only made subject to certain conditions intended to ensure a fair balance between the protection of public interests and respect for the rights of the defence. In the present case the applicant had deliberately failed to comply with the warrant for his arrest, since he had not attended the hearing for the delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the date of which had been duly notified to him, and had had himself admitted to a psychiatric clinic without informing the Court of Appeal and without giving the address. The ruling that the appeal was inadmissible had thus been proportionate to the aim pursued, which was to make it possible to enforce the court’s order against Mr Guérin, regard being had in addition to the level of the court which had ruled it inadmissible. Moreover, unlike Mr Poitrimol, the applicant had had the benefit of adversarial procedure at first instance and on appeal, so that the Court’s conclusion in its judgment in that case (see paragraph 34 above) could not be transposed to the present case. Lastly, scrutiny of the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a whole showed that his right to a fair trial had been respected."

The Commission considered that the finding the Court had reached in its Poitrimol judgment should be even more applicable in the case of a defendant who was not seeking to evade justice, but was in hospital, and who had complied with the arrest warrant as soon as he came out of hospital, the Court of Cassation’s attention having been duly drawn to his particular situation. On this point it expressed the view that for the Government to demand that this situation be explained in the notice of appeal itself would be too formalistic, regard being had to the repercussions and consequences of that requirement for respect of the right of access to a court, which was an essential element of a fair trial as guaranteed by the Convention."

However, these limitations must not restrict exercise of the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. They must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see the Fayed v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 49–50, § 65; the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 78–79, § 59; the Bellet v.

In the present case the Court of Cassation declared the appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that “[i]t follows from the general principles of criminal procedure that a convicted person who has not complied with a court order is not entitled to act through a representative in order to lodge an appeal on points of law. It could not be otherwise unless he supplied evidence of circumstances making it absolutely impossible for him to surrender to custody at the appropriate time. In the present case the appellant has not supplied evidence of any such circumstances” (see paragraph 21 above)."

The Court notes in the first place that the obligation for a defendant sentenced to a non-suspended term of imprisonment accompanied by a warrant for his arrest to surrender to custody at the time when he gives notice of his intention to appeal on points of law, that is within five days of delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment (see paragraph 24 above), is derived from the very long-established and consistent case-law of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation (see paragraph 28 above)."

At the hearing the Agent of the Government emphasised that this rule had an essentially moral basis and was underpinned by the idea “that it would be shocking to allow a person who has deliberately failed to comply with a court order to appeal on points of law”. It was not absolute and was no longer applied where the appellant’s good faith could be presumed, as, for example, when he came in person to sign his notice of appeal (see paragraph 29 above)."

However, some French legal writers have criticised the rule, arguing that the decision, when considering an appeal on points of law, to declare it inadmissible ipso jure when the convicted person has not surrendered to custody within the five-day time-limit is based on a presumption that he is at fault, whereas his fault is not necessarily intentional."

The Court can only note that, where an appeal on points of law is declared inadmissible solely because, as in the present case, the appellant has not surrendered to custody pursuant to the judicial decision challenged in the appeal, this ruling compels the appellant to subject himself in advance to the deprivation of liberty resulting from the impugned decision, although that decision cannot be considered final until the appeal has been decided or the time-limit for lodging an appeal has expired.",

Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6” (see the Delcourt v.

In addition, it noted that Mr Findlay ’ s court-martial board contained no judicial members, no legally qualified members and no civilians, that it was set up on an ad hoc basis and that the convening officer had the power to dissolve it either before or during the trial. The requirement to take an oath was not a sufficient guarantee of independence.",
                "Accordingly, it considered that the applicant ’ s fears about the independence of the court martial could be regarded as objectively justified, particularly in view of the nature and extent of the convening officer ’ s roles, the composition of the court martial and its ad hoc nature. This defect was not, moreover, remedied by any subsequent review by a judicial body affording all the guarantees required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since the confirming officer was the same person as the convening officer, and the reviewing authorities were army officers, the second of whom was superior in rank to the first. The ineffectiveness of the post-hearing reviews was further underlined by the secrecy surrounding them and the lack of opportunity for Mr Findlay to participate in a meaningful way."

The Court recalls that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered as \"independent\", regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 15, para. 37).",
                "As to the question of \"impartiality\", there are two aspects to this requirement. First, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 792, para. 30).",

The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay ’ s case. He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate. He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).",
                "Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those \"reasonably requested\" by the defence. His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).",

It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above)."

This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of \"tribunal\" and can also be seen as a component of the \"independence\" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45)."

Whilst impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, be tested in various ways. A distinction can be drawn in this context between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect.",
                "(a) As regards the first approach, the Court notes that the applicant is pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Van de Walle ’ s personal impartiality; it does not itself have any cause for doubt on this score and indeed personal impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58).",
                "However, it is not possible to confine oneself to a purely subjective test. In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",
                "(b) It would be going too far to the opposite extreme to maintain that former judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department were unable to sit on the bench in every case that had been examined initially by that department, even though they had never had to deal with the case themselves. So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",
                "(c) The Belgian Court of Cassation, which took Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) into consideration of its own motion, adopted in this case a criterion based on the functions exercised, namely whether the judge had previously intervened \"in the case in or on the occasion of the exercise of ... functions as a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department\". It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "(d) Even when clarified in the manner just mentioned, a criterion of this kind does not fully meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

                "(a) Before 1955, although there were no written rules on the subject, the Court of Cassation had delivered eight judgments in which it had been held that a judicial officer who had acted as public prosecutor in criminal proceedings could not thereafter sit in the case as a judge and, in particular, on the assize court bench. The Court of Cassation founded this prohibition on a general and absolute principle that was said to derive from the very nature of the functions. The avocat général summarised the judgments as follows:",
                "\"It is of little moment - that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case only occasionally or by chance...;",
                "- that his intervention did not implicate one or more of the accused by name;",
                "- that his intervention did not involve a formal step in the process of investigation.",

                "There is incompatibility as soon as the judicial officer, during the course of the prosecution, has personally intervened in the case in the capacity of member of the public prosecutor ’ s department.\"",
                "(b) The second period (1955-1968), during which the Court of Cassation apparently did not have occasion to rule on the problem of incompatibility between the functions of public prosecutor and the functions of judge, was marked by two new factors: the incorporation of the Convention into the Belgian domestic legal system and the developments in domestic case-law with regard to the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",
                "The litigant ’ s right to \"an impartial tribunal\", within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, could imply either that a judge was simply obliged to withdraw if he were at all biased as regards the case or, alternatively, that he was under the more extensive duty of withdrawing whenever there was a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the requisite guarantees of impartiality. The avocat général rejected the first interpretation, which he described as \"restrictive\", in favour of the second, the \"extensive\", interpretation; he relied notably on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ( account to be taken of the object and purpose) and on the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970 (Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, § 25 in fine). As regards the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court, he also referred to judgments of the Belgian Court of Cassation and the Belgian Conseil d ’ État. In addition, he cited the following passage from an inaugural address of 1 September 1970 to the Court of Cassation: \"any judge whose impartiality may legitimately give rise to doubts must refrain from taking part in the decision\".",
                "(c) The third period saw the entry into force of Articles 127 and 292 of the Judicial Code (see paragraph 22 below) and the application by the Court of Cassation of the second of these Articles to cases where a decision had been given by a judge who had previously acted as a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department. According to the avocat général, the five judgments that he listed followed the same approach as those delivered in the first period and established that:",

                "- appeared at a hearing at which the court did no more than adopt a purely procedural measure; or",
                "- taken some step which was manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, the avocat général concluded that the Court of Cassation should \"set aside the judgment under appeal ... whether on the sixth ground adduced by the appellant or on the ground, to be taken into consideration by the Court of its own motion, of violation either of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention ... or of the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court\".",
                "The avocat général stressed that the covering note of 4 February 1977 emanated from the investigating judge, the person who quite naturally was best informed not only as to the background to the case but also as to the identity of the judicial officer or officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department who were dealing with the prosecution. And Mr. Preuveneers had added to the covering note, in manuscript, the words \"for the attention of Mr. P. Van de Walle \", thereby indicating the specific addressee for whom the note was personally intended:",
                "\"If the investigating judge marked this covering note as being for Mr. P. Van de Walle ’ s attention, it is logical to suppose that he knew that that judicial officer had personally played some part or other in the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "What other reasonable explanation can be given for such a course of action ... which surely would not have been taken unless the two officers had been in contact regarding the investigation of the case?",
                "It is of little moment that other judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case, for example to follow up the investigating judge ’ s covering note, or that Mr. Van de Walle intervened only by chance or occasionally, or that such intervention has not been shown to have implicated the appellant or a co-accused by name or ... to have involved a formal step in the process of investigation.",
                "Finally, there would be no reasonable explanation for the handwritten words ... if Mr. Van de Walle ’ s intervention in the case had until then been limited to steps that were purely routine or ... were manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.\"",
                "Even if the Court of Cassation were not to allow the appeal on the sixth ground, which was based on Article 127 of the Judicial Code, the circumstances described above were, in the opinion of the avocat général, Mr. Velu, sufficient to give rise to legitimate doubts as to whether the President of the Assize Court had offered the guarantees of impartiality required both by Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and by the general principle whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",

                "As regards the sixth ground of appeal, the Court of Cassation observed firstly that the mere despatch of the covering note of 4 February 1977 did not necessarily show that Mr. Van de Walle had \"acted in the case as public prosecutor\", within the meaning of Article 127 of the Judicial Code.",
                "The Court of Cassation also took into consideration of its own motion Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and the general principle of law establishing the right to the impartiality of the court. It was true that both of these norms obliged a judge to refrain from taking part in the decision if there were a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused person was entitled. However, the Court held that the documents which it could take into account did not reveal that after the public prosecutor ’ s department had received the covering note mentioned in the ground of appeal, Mr. Van de Walle, who was then a senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, had taken any decision or intervened in any manner whatsoever in the conduct of the prosecution relating to the facts in question. Admittedly, for a judge ’ s impartiality to be regarded as compromised on account of his previous intervention in the capacity of judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department, it was not essential that such intervention should have consisted of adopting a personal standpoint in the matter or taking a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation. Nevertheless, it could not be assumed that a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department had intervened in a case in or on the occasion of the exercise of his functions as such an officer merely because there was a covering note which had been addressed to him personally by the investigating judge but which had not been shown by any evidence to have been received by the officer or to have caused him to take even an indirect interest in the case. In this connection, the Court of Cassation noted finally that it was not the senior deputy Van de Walle who had replied to the covering note.",

As regards the covering note of 4 February 1977 (see paragraph 10 above), the investigating judge, Mr. Preuveneers, was said to have written thereon the words \"for the attention of Mr. P.

In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",

So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",

It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",

In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

That is why a strict interpretation is called for of the criteria authorising what are ‘ veritable investigative powers ’ ( Stéfani and Levasseur, Droit pénal général et procédure pénale, 1966 edition, volume II, no. 259).",
                "Admittedly Article 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which defines the conditions for an investigation under the flagrante delicto procedure, does not indicate any time-limit for such an investigation, with the result that the surprisingly long duration - ten days - of that carried out following the criminal bomb attack at Mauléon is not sufficient to entail its nullity, but this extension beyond the usual period in such circumstances exposed the police officers to the risk of losing sight of the conditions laid down in the relevant provision. Thus the measures taken by them against Sainte-Marie are open to the following criticisms:",

This interruption of over twenty- four hours removed any justification for the very prolonged continuation of the inquiry under the flagrante delicto procedure.",
                "Secondly, the attention of the police officers was finally drawn to Sainte-Marie not only because he was known to be sympathetic to the Basque separatist movements, but also by the information received on 30 January that this new suspect sometimes drove a Renault 14 of the same colour as a Simca ‘ Horizon ’ which had been noticed in a street of Mauléon on the night of the attack. Yet it is ‘ within a very short time after the offence ’ (Article 53 of the C.C.P. [Code of Criminal Procedure]) that the persons suspected must manifest ‘ marks or clues ’ and this temporal condition cannot be regarded as satisfied where the clue which led the investigators to Sainte-Marie ’ s home was only discovered by them ten days after the offences had been committed.",

In addition, neither of them had previously been involved in the case as a representative of the prosecuting authority or as investigating judge. Finally, the decision of 8 August 1985 had dealt solely with the question of Mr Sainte-Marie ’ s remand custody; the Indictment Division had not made any assessment in it of the applicant ’ s possible criminal liability arising out of the attack on the Mauléon-Licharre police station.",

The main thrust of the applicant ’ s argument, namely that the fact of having ruled on the question of detention on remand necessarily entails a lack of objective impartiality, runs counter to the Court ’ s case-law. According to the Hauschildt judgment of 24 May 1989, which moreover is concerned, as appears from its express wording, solely with the decisions of a judge who is not responsible for preparing the case for trial, the mere fact that such a judge has already taken pre-trial decisions in the case, including decisions relating to detention on remand, cannot in itself justify fears as to his impartiality (Series A no. 154, p. 22, paras. 50-51).

On 8 August 1985 the Indictment Division made \"express reference\" to the facts which it had already examined in the decision of 5 April 1985. That decision, given by a division composed to a large extent differently (see paragraph 13 above), set out extremely precise findings: Mr Sainte-Marie \"said that he was a member of Iparretarrak, admitted ownership of the arms, ammunition and unlawful or suspect articles found in the cars and at his home\" and \"acknowledged having even participated as driver in the expedition of 24-25 November 1984\" against the Lecumberry police station; \"the firearm and the ammunition seized ... were of the same type as those normally used by the Basque revolutionary group, Iparretarrak\" (see paragraph 12 above).",

He did not retract these statements and never claimed that they had been obtained under duress. They were moreover corroborated by uncontested physical evidence. The Indictment Division confined itself to making a brief assessment of the available facts in order to establish whether prima facie the police suspicions had some substance and gave grounds for fearing that there was a risk of the accused ’ s absconding."

There has therefore been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."

Whilst impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, be tested in various ways. A distinction can be drawn in this context between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect.",
                "(a) As regards the first approach, the Court notes that the applicant is pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Van de Walle ’ s personal impartiality; it does not itself have any cause for doubt on this score and indeed personal impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58).",
                "However, it is not possible to confine oneself to a purely subjective test. In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",
                "(b) It would be going too far to the opposite extreme to maintain that former judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department were unable to sit on the bench in every case that had been examined initially by that department, even though they had never had to deal with the case themselves. So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",
                "(c) The Belgian Court of Cassation, which took Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) into consideration of its own motion, adopted in this case a criterion based on the functions exercised, namely whether the judge had previously intervened \"in the case in or on the occasion of the exercise of ... functions as a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department\". It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "(d) Even when clarified in the manner just mentioned, a criterion of this kind does not fully meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

                "16. In his submissions, Mr. Velu, an avocat général, retraced developments in the relevant Belgian legislation and judicial decisions, distinguishing between three periods:",
                "(a) Before 1955, although there were no written rules on the subject, the Court of Cassation had delivered eight judgments in which it had been held that a judicial officer who had acted as public prosecutor in criminal proceedings could not thereafter sit in the case as a judge and, in particular, on the assize court bench. The Court of Cassation founded this prohibition on a general and absolute principle that was said to derive from the very nature of the functions. The avocat général summarised the judgments as follows:",
                "\"It is of little moment - that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case only occasionally or by chance...;",
                "- that his intervention did not implicate one or more of the accused by name;",
                "- that his intervention did not involve a formal step in the process of investigation.",
                "It suffices that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department personally played some part in the conduct of the prosecution in the case in question.",
                "There is incompatibility as soon as the judicial officer, during the course of the prosecution, has personally intervened in the case in the capacity of member of the public prosecutor ’ s department.\"",
                "(b) The second period (1955-1968), during which the Court of Cassation apparently did not have occasion to rule on the problem of incompatibility between the functions of public prosecutor and the functions of judge, was marked by two new factors: the incorporation of the Convention into the Belgian domestic legal system and the developments in domestic case-law with regard to the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",
                "The litigant ’ s right to \"an impartial tribunal\", within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, could imply either that a judge was simply obliged to withdraw if he were at all biased as regards the case or, alternatively, that he was under the more extensive duty of withdrawing whenever there was a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the requisite guarantees of impartiality. The avocat général rejected the first interpretation, which he described as \"restrictive\", in favour of the second, the \"extensive\", interpretation; he relied notably on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ( account to be taken of the object and purpose) and on the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970 (Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, § 25 in fine). As regards the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court, he also referred to judgments of the Belgian Court of Cassation and the Belgian Conseil d ’ État. In addition, he cited the following passage from an inaugural address of 1 September 1970 to the Court of Cassation: \"any judge whose impartiality may legitimately give rise to doubts must refrain from taking part in the decision\".",
                "(c) The third period saw the entry into force of Articles 127 and 292 of the Judicial Code (see paragraph 22 below) and the application by the Court of Cassation of the second of these Articles to cases where a decision had been given by a judge who had previously acted as a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department. According to the avocat général, the five judgments that he listed followed the same approach as those delivered in the first period and established that:",
                "( i ) notwithstanding Article 292 of the Judicial Code, the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court had retained its full force;",
                "(ii) for the purposes of that Article, the expression \"dealing with a case in the exercise of the functions of public prosecutor\" signified intervening therein in the capacity of prosecuting party;",
                "(iii) there could not be said to have been such an intervention if, in the case concerned, a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department had simply",
                "- appeared at a hearing at which the court did no more than adopt a purely procedural measure; or",
                "- taken some step which was manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, the avocat général concluded that the Court of Cassation should \"set aside the judgment under appeal ... whether on the sixth ground adduced by the appellant or on the ground, to be taken into consideration by the Court of its own motion, of violation either of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention ... or of the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court\".",
                "The avocat général stressed that the covering note of 4 February 1977 emanated from the investigating judge, the person who quite naturally was best informed not only as to the background to the case but also as to the identity of the judicial officer or officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department who were dealing with the prosecution. And Mr. Preuveneers had added to the covering note, in manuscript, the words \"for the attention of Mr. P. Van de Walle \", thereby indicating the specific addressee for whom the note was personally intended:",
                "\"If the investigating judge marked this covering note as being for Mr. P. Van de Walle ’ s attention, it is logical to suppose that he knew that that judicial officer had personally played some part or other in the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "What other reasonable explanation can be given for such a course of action ... which surely would not have been taken unless the two officers had been in contact regarding the investigation of the case?",
                "It is of little moment that other judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case, for example to follow up the investigating judge ’ s covering note, or that Mr. Van de Walle intervened only by chance or occasionally, or that such intervention has not been shown to have implicated the appellant or a co-accused by name or ... to have involved a formal step in the process of investigation.",
                "Finally, there would be no reasonable explanation for the handwritten words ... if Mr. Van de Walle ’ s intervention in the case had until then been limited to steps that were purely routine or ... were manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.\"",
                "Even if the Court of Cassation were not to allow the appeal on the sixth ground, which was based on Article 127 of the Judicial Code, the circumstances described above were, in the opinion of the avocat général, Mr. Velu, sufficient to give rise to legitimate doubts as to whether the President of the Assize Court had offered the guarantees of impartiality required both by Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and by the general principle whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",

                "As regards the sixth ground of appeal, the Court of Cassation observed firstly that the mere despatch of the covering note of 4 February 1977 did not necessarily show that Mr. Van de Walle had \"acted in the case as public prosecutor\", within the meaning of Article 127 of the Judicial Code.",
                "The Court of Cassation also took into consideration of its own motion Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and the general principle of law establishing the right to the impartiality of the court. It was true that both of these norms obliged a judge to refrain from taking part in the decision if there were a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused person was entitled. However, the Court held that the documents which it could take into account did not reveal that after the public prosecutor ’ s department had received the covering note mentioned in the ground of appeal, Mr. Van de Walle, who was then a senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, had taken any decision or intervened in any manner whatsoever in the conduct of the prosecution relating to the facts in question. Admittedly, for a judge ’ s impartiality to be regarded as compromised on account of his previous intervention in the capacity of judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department, it was not essential that such intervention should have consisted of adopting a personal standpoint in the matter or taking a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation. Nevertheless, it could not be assumed that a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department had intervened in a case in or on the occasion of the exercise of his functions as such an officer merely because there was a covering note which had been addressed to him personally by the investigating judge but which had not been shown by any evidence to have been received by the officer or to have caused him to take even an indirect interest in the case.

As regards the covering note of 4 February 1977 (see paragraph 10 above), the investigating judge, Mr. Preuveneers, was said to have written thereon the words \"for the attention of Mr. P.

Whilst impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, be tested in various ways. A distinction can be drawn in this context between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect.",
                "(a) As regards the first approach, the Court notes that the applicant is pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Van de Walle ’ s personal impartiality; it does not itself have any cause for doubt on this score and indeed personal impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58).",

In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",

So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",
                "(c) The Belgian Court of Cassation, which took Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) into consideration of its own motion, adopted in this case a criterion based on the functions exercised, namely whether the judge had previously intervened \"in the case in or on the occasion of the exercise of ... functions as a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department\". It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "(d) Even when clarified in the manner just mentioned, a criterion of this kind does not fully meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

Those proceedings concerned the operation of the “tax-minimisation scheme” using trading companies, described above. In the following months more claims concerning the tax situation of Yukos and its affiliates were lodged. The commercial courts granted most of the Tax Service’s claims. As a result Yukos had to declare itself insolvent and bankruptcy proceedings were started, which ended up by a forced sale of its assets and, finally, by the liquidation of the company on 12 November 2007. The company ceased to exist, leaving over RUB 227.1 billion (around 9.2 billion US dollars (USD)) in unsatisfied liabilities.

Yukos sought instead to maximise its oil production and market share. Further, from 2003 Yukos was in the process of merging with Sibneft, another large Russian oil company. The merger was supposed to take place in two steps: firstly, completion of the deal on paper, and then unification of the new company’s management structures. The first aspect of the deal was finalised in October 2003; the second was supposed to be implemented by January 2004. Yukos was also engaged in merger talks with the US-based Exxon Mobil and Chevron Texaco companies.

The value of the promissory notes was later offset from the tax debt of the sham companies. Thus, in 1999 the four sham companies (Business Oil, Forest Oil, Vald Oil and Mitra) transferred to the Lesnoy town budget promissory notes in the amount of RUB 5,315,535,283; in 2000 the sham companies transferred promissory noted worth of RUB 10,381,901,191."

On 9 March 2005 the defence lawyers requested disclosure of the expert report that had been allegedly commissioned by the prosecution in the context of the criminal investigation into the activities of the Lesnoy town administration (the case which had been closed in 2002). For the defence it was unclear whether this report (mentioned in some of the GPO documents, namely in the decision to re-open the case of 18 July 2003) was the same document as the study prepared by the UBRAS at the request of the Lesnoy town administration (see paragraph 30 above), the copy of which was in the possession of Mr Bochko and which had earlier been submitted to the court by the defence (see paragraph 214 below). The prosecution objected to disclosure of the expert report, arguing that the court had no power to order disclosure. On 9 March 2005 the court ruled that the defence had not specified what legal and economic review might be obtained from the materials of the 2002 criminal case. Moreover, the court noted that the expert evaluation requested had been carried in the context of a criminal case which was still at the stage of preliminary investigation.",

Both reports were collected by the defence on 10 January 2005. In his report on the company-tax evasion charges Mr Shchekin explained that it was common and accepted practice for taxes to be paid for by promissory notes in 1999; he relied in particular upon a letter of December 1999 from the Finance Minister and the First Deputy Minister of Taxes and the decision of the Federal Commercial Court of 24 December 2001. Mr Shchekin further explained that the trading companies had entered into lawful agreements with the local administration for taxes to be paid by way of promissory notes. Mr Shchekin also explained that in his opinion there was no basis for characterising the trading companies as sham companies. He indicated that the question of where the oil products traded by those companies were produced and kept was irrelevant for granting them the tax cuts. In support he referred to the decision of the Federal Commercial Court for the North-West District, which in the judgment of 5 June 2002 in case no. A42֊6604/00-15-818/01 considered the granting of tax cuts in a similar situation to be legal."

The tax audits carried out by tax inspectorates during the period under review did not reveal any violations of the law in this respect; tax authorities registered and recorded non-monetary tax payment receipts in accordance with the established procedures ( inter alia, by completing a form which was approved under Decree of 23 December 1998). He explained that the promissory notes were highly liquid securities which, bearing an interest rate of 28 per cent per annum, were well suited to constitute investments for a municipal administration. Payment on such notes was underwritten by the Doveritelny i Investsionny Commercial Bank, which entered into an agreement with the Lesnoy town authority to repurchase the securities on demand."

Mr Bochko produced a copy of that report to the court; the defence asked the court to attach it to the materials of the case. That study concluded that, far from causing any damage, the granting of the tax concessions had been positively beneficial. The granting of tax concessions had made it possible to rescue the Lesnoy town economy from a state of permanent crisis. In particular, the experts concluded that the refund of tax overpayments by Yukos promissory notes “had not caused damage to the town and federal budgets” and that the Lesnoy town trading companies had been entitled to pay tax in advance since this was the “unconditional right of a taxpayer”. Further, the experts concluded that the Lesnoy town administration was entitled to accept tax payments by way of promissory notes in 1999.

In fact, the documents were seized and examined in Murmansk and not in Moscow. The court also noted that the report on the search of 9 July 2003 in Apatit’s premises indicated that the documents seized during that search had been examined by the investigators on 10 June 2003. The court considered that this had been a typing error too.

Finally, the court noted that the investigators did not know that they were searching in the premises of a law firm. None of the lawyers who were present during that search asked the investigators to allow them to participate in the searches. The District Court noted that a search was an urgent measure. In the court’s opinion, the investigators had learnt that they had been searching in the offices of a lawyer “from V.V.

The court further held that several attesting witnesses had participated in the searches and were able to supervise their progress. As to the statements by Ms Ardatova, Ms Morozova and Mr Rakhmankulov, relied on by the defence, the court discounted them.

Most of the persons who had set up those companies on their behalf worked at Yukos, Menatep, Rosprom, and other affiliates of Yukos. In that capacity those persons were subordinated to the applicants. Further, the sham companies had no financial resources of their own, but operated with the financial support of Menatep, Rosprom, and Yukos.

After ruling on such requests, the judge begins the “judicial investigation” of the case. The prosecutor opens the case for the accusation by setting out succinctly the essence of the accusation with reference to the relevant Articles of the Criminal Code. The judge then asks the accused if he (the accused) understands the accusation and whether or not he considers himself guilty. If the accused understands the charges and does not plead guilty, the examination of evidence produced by the prosecution begins. The prosecution decides on the order in which witnesses are called and other evidence is presented to the court. The defence can intervene and challenge the witnesses for the prosecution, put questions, etc., but the presiding judge can reject leading or irrelevant questions. An expert witness who gave an opinion during the preliminary investigation may be summoned and questioned in court; further expert examinations can be ordered if necessary. After the prosecution finishes its submission of evidence, the floor is given to the defence. The prosecution can challenge evidence adduced by the defence."

A40 ‑ 31714/97-2-312) concerned a series of intertwined transactions (rent contracts and loan agreements) between the respondent entity and two third parties: as a result, the respondent leased a building in central Moscow to the third parties, but was able to avoid inclusion of the rent payments in the taxable base of its operations by claiming that they were interest payments in respect of the loan agreement. The Tax Service discovered the tax-evasion scheme, re-characterised the transactions in question as rent and ordered the taxpayer to pay RUB 2 billion in back taxes. The case was examined in three rounds of court proceedings by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. Having regard to the substance of the transactions entered into by the respondent, the terms of payment and execution of the contested contracts, and, generally, to the conduct of the respondent company and the third parties, the courts decided that the contractual arrangement had been sham, re-characterised the arrangement as rent and upheld the decision of the Tax Service. In the first round of proceedings the courts adopted their decisions on the following dates: 1 December 1997, 27 January 1998 and 30 March 1998.

It concerned, in particular, interpretation of the concept of “other means” used in Article 199 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiffs in that case considered that the concept of “other means” was too vague, might lead to arbitrary interpretation and was therefore unconstitutional. In particular, Mr T., one of the plaintiffs, was a director of a firm which had an outstanding tax debt. Instead of paying that debt he spent the money of his firm for other purposes. Such behaviour was considered as tax evasion “by other means” and Mr T. was convicted. The Constitutional Court held that “taxes ... can be considered as lawfully established only where the law defines clearly the object of taxation, the taxable amounts, the amounts of tax payments, category of taxpayers [concerned] and other substantive elements of a fiscal obligation”.

The court found that 70 per cent of the average number of staff in the company were ZATO residents and that they received more than 70 per cent of wages paid by the company. The central argument for the Tax Inspectorate was that the business activity of the defendant company (which consisted of processing and re-selling of oil-products) was not carried out on the territory of ZATO and that it was done by the industrial facilities which did not belong to the defendant company.

All the above circumstances as such did not exclude that the company was carrying out its activities on the territory of the ZATO and are irrelevant for the case at hand, since they are not taken into account by the tax law in order to define conditions for tax cuts.",
                "The fact that the first-instance court and the court of appeal examined those circumstances demonstrates that they interpreted Section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs wrongly and went beyond [the mere examination] of conditions explicitly referred thereby for obtaining tax cuts. In breach of Article 3 (7) of the Tax Code the lower courts [wrongly] assumed that since the law did not refer to other criteria for defining whether the business activity was carried out on the territory of ZATO other than the presence of fixed assets, personnel and wages [there], the tax inspectorate or the court could establish such criteria by themselves.",
                "The argument of the Tax Inspectorate that the Director General of the company had no permanent place of residence in the ZATO is equally irrelevant, since Section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs makes tax cuts conditional of the fact that 70 per cent of staff of the company-taxpayer lives in the ZATO, but not necessarily the director of the company taxpayer.

The documents submitted by the company to the Tax Inspectorate demonstrated that the company satisfied all requirements of section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs. The Tax Inspectorate, within a “desk” tax audit, was not empowered to visit premises of the company. Although after the decision bringing the company to tax liability the Tax Inspectorate conducted an “on-the-site” tax audit of the company, its results cannot be used to support the conclusions of the decision of 2000. The court of cassation also held that it was wrong to shift on the company the burden of proof that it had indeed carried out its business activities on the territory of ZATO.

The price of the licence thus constituted a nominal annual advance tax payment (calculated as a multiple of the State defined minimum wage), and exempted the entrepreneur from further taxation (including state insurance premiums) in respect of the licensed activity income.

As a result, the service agreement had his signatures on behalf of both sides: he signed it in the capacity of an individual entrepreneur and in the capacity of the sole owner of the company. The fees paid by the company to Mr K. were included in its declaration as “costs”. The Tax Inspectorate considered that these fees could not be regarded as “costs” on the ground that the service agreement between the company and Mr K. was null, since it was signed by the same person on both sides. The court of cassation, however, ruled in favour of the taxpayer company. It held, in particular, that the charter of the company did not provide for the position of a general director, and that his functions could therefore be transferred to an external person. Furthermore, there was nothing in the law to prevent the company from “outsourcing” the managerial function to somebody else.

In 1999 they were convicted by the Ostankinskiy District Court of Moscow for company tax evasion (under Article 199 of the Criminal Code), for having submitted false information in the tax declaration submitted on behalf of the “Taros Corporation” company.

Placement in an isolation cell is a punishment for various breaches of prison rules, from the “repeated non-compliance with prison rules” to attacking the prison staff. All contacts, except for contacts with the lawyer, are prohibited for a detainee placed in an isolation cell. He is not allowed to buy foodstuff in the prison shop or receive parcels from his relatives.

In the 21 st General Report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) ( CPT/Inf (2011) 28) made certain recommendations on the solitary confinement of prisoners. It noted, in p. 55, that “solitary confinement further restricts the already highly limited rights of people deprived of their liberty. The extra restrictions involved are not inherent in the fact of imprisonment and thus have to be separately justified”. For the CPT, it is appropriate to apply the traditional tests developed by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. In particular, any further restriction of a prisoner’s rights must be linked to the actual harm the prisoner has caused in the prison setting. During solitary confinement there should, for example, be no automatic withdrawal of rights to visits, telephone calls and correspondence or of access to resources normally available to prisoners (such as reading materials). Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, the CPT considers that the principle of proportionality requires that it be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, no higher than 14 days for a given offence, and preferably lower. Prisoners undergoing solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should be entitled to at least one hour’s outdoor exercise per day, from the very first day of placement in solitary confinement, and should also be permitted access to a reasonable range of reading material (for further details see Razvyazkin v. Russia, no. 13579/09, § 89, 3 July 2012). On the last point the 21 st General Report reiterated recommendation made in respect of the Russian Federation in the Report on the 2001 visit to the Russian Federation (CPT/inf (2003) 30), made public on 30 June 2003, where it urged the Russian authorities in § 119 to “take steps to ensure throughout the country that prisoners placed in disciplinary cells have access to reading matter.”"

The reason for his placement in the isolation cell was the fact that he had complained to the Prosecutor General about the actions of Mr Tagiev, the director of the remand prison. Thus, Mr Tagiev, who had submitted the information about the conditions in the isolation cell, definitely had an interest in providing an untrue account. The applicant believed that the documents appended to the Government’s memorandum had been drawn up by persons who were not disinterested.

In assessing whether the treatment inflicted on a prisoner went beyond the “inevitable element of suffering or humiliation” associated with the deprivation of liberty, the Court often took into account the cumulative effect of various aspects of prison life ( Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-II). In previous cases the Court analysed such factors as access to natural light or air in the cells, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements, the opportunity to use the toilet in private and the availability of ventilation (see, for example, Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, §§ 70-72, ECHR 2001-III; Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; and Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, § 84, 12 June 2008). That list is not exhaustive; other conditions of detention may lead the Court to the conclusion that the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded and the applicant was subjected to “inhuman or degrading treatment” (see, for example, Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, § 68, 25 October 2005; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007; and Slyusarev v. Russia, no. 60333/00, § 36, ECHR 2010-...).

The Court had to assess whether, in view of the danger he represented, “the measures taken [i.e. isolation] were necessary and proportionate compared to the available alternatives” (§ 136). In Ensslin, Baader and Raspe v.

Some of the submitted documents mentioned that the applicant had refused to go to the shower (see paragraph 57 above). Whatever the real reason for imposing a disciplinary sanction, the Court considers that the applicant’s fault, if any, was not particularly serious and did not probably call for such a measure (see in this respect the CPT’s recommendation that such a serious punishment as solitary confinement should be commensurable to the disciplinary offence for which it was imposed, paragraph 455 above). The Court reiterates that although it is not for the Court to specify which security measures may be applied to prisoners, “the absence of any substantive reasons” for placing a detainee in a solitary confinement cell for a considerable period of time can be a relevant factor for characterising this form of disciplinary punishment as “inhuman and degrading treatment” (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, § 211, 10 April 2012; see also Razvyazkin, cited above, § 107)."

In particular, the Court takes it as accepted that the cell had a window measuring 90 x 60 cm. It is questionable whether such a window would provide enough natural light for a cell measuring 5.5 square metres. The permanent electric light in the cell may have been very disturbing for a detainee, and the one-metre distance between the open toilet pan and the sleeping place was clearly insufficient. Furthermore, the applicant had been deprived of all social contacts, could not read books or magazines or watch TV (see paragraph 452 above), and could not lie down on the bunk-bed, since it was unfolded only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m."

However, the Court is not required to resolve this factual controversy on those points. Even if the applicant’s description of the other conditions of detention was accurate, and even if such conditions might indeed be very uncomfortable, it is crucial to note that the situation complained of lasted for only seven days (cf. with Popandopulo v. Russia, no. 4512/09, § 95, 10 May 2011, or A.B. v. Russia, cited above, §§ 105 et seq., where the applicants’ solitary confinment lasted much longer). The Court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the degree of suffering to which the applicant was exposed, given its short duration and in view of the applicant’s age and mental and physical condition, did not reach the minimal threshold of severity to amount to “inhuman or degrading” treatment.

It was therefore possible for the applicant to prepare tea, coffee or instant food during the day.

Russia, no. 25432/05, § 54, 7 October 2010; Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 69, 21 December 2010; and Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 41833/04, § 88, 27 January 2011). The applicant in the present case claimed that for most of the time he had been deprived even of that short walk.

The Court reiterates its factual findings in the case of Trepashkin v.

This fact is confirmed by, amongst other sources, the letter from the Ministry of Justice concerning the delays in dispatching prisoners to and back from the Moscow courts ...",

However, the Government did not explain whether any special arrangements had been made for those returning from the courts in the evening, especially in winter, when the “daytime” is short.

Such security arrangements, which might exceptionally be warranted in the case of dangerous defendants, were wholly unjustified in the applicant’s case. The applicant was charged with economic crimes and there was no reasonable basis for keeping him in a cage during the trial. He had never been convicted of any criminal offence prior to his trial.

The Government’s reference to certain “security risks” was too vague and was not supported by any specific fact. It appears that “the metal cage in the ... courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant’s placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated” (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, cited above, § 127). Furthermore, the applicant’s own safety or the safety of the co-accused was not at stake. Finally, the applicant’s trial was covered by almost all major national and international mass media, so the applicant was permanently exposed to the public at large in such a setting. As in Ashot Harutyunyan the Court concludes that “such a harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial.

It held, in particular, that when choosing a measure of restraint for the first time a court may rely on relatively loose presumptions of fact, and that the existence of a potential risk, for example, the risk of fleeing, cannot be demonstrated with the same degree of certitude as the existence of a fact that has already occurred (see §§ 188 et seq.).

In their submissions the Government described in detail the circumstances of the second applicant’s arrest and claimed that his behaviour at that point, as well as his informal exchanges with his lawyers had been indicative of his inclination to flee (see paragraph 489 above). However, the Court notes that these arguments did not constitute part of the domestic courts’ reasoning. The Government further referred to the testimony of potential witnesses who had fled the country, allegedly at the insistence of the Yukos management (see paragraph 491 above). The Court notes that that testimony was collected only in 2007-2008 and, consequently, had not been relied upon by the domestic courts in 2003 ‑ 2005. The same concerns information about credit cards issued by foreign banks in the applicant’s name, real-estate abroad and private jets which had allegedly been at the applicant’s disposal at Vnukovo airport: those factual elements were not mentioned in the extension orders under examination.

By the end of 2004 the court had completed its examination of evidence collected by the prosecution. These developments significantly reduced the risk of tampering with evidence. Furthermore, throughout 2004 the main assets of Yukos were attached and sold at auction (see the Yukos case, §§ 92 et seq.). Thus, the second applicant ceased to exercise de facto control over the company; his ability to influence the company’s personnel was accordingly reduced.

Thus, the mention of the second applicant’s “international connections” was too vague and was not supported by any evidence. The Court stresses that, given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the domestic courts were in a position to take a closer look at the second applicant’s alleged “international connections” and explain it in their decisions (compare Aleksanyan v.

Russia, no. 30033/05, § 152, 19 March 2009). The fact that other Yukos managers and shareholders had left Russia might probably have been relevant at the initial stage of the investigation, but “the fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account” (see Sizov v. Russia, no. 33123/08, § 53, 15 March 2011). Furthermore, the Court notes that “the behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee’s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee” (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 76, 1 June 2006)."

The Court reiterates in this respect that “Article 5 contains more flexible procedural requirements than Article 6 while being much more stringent as regards speediness” (see Lebedev (no. 1), § 84). The Court observes that the applicant was represented by a group of highly professional lawyers, that the hearings were adjourned for one or two hours each time when the defence asked for it, and that the defence did not seek extra adjournments (see paragraph 49, 51 and 53 above). The Court concludes that even though the prosecution had more time to develop their arguments, given the nature of the proceedings, this disparity between the parties did not perturb the principle of equality of arms to an extent incompatible with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention."

Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 82-88, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, §§ 34-39, 30 November 2000). Where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 § 4; at the same time, the standard of speediness “is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal.... The Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees” (see Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 179, 5 June 2012). In the case of Mamedova, cited above, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the “speediness” requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days respectively, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, § 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v. Russia, no. 27193/02, §§ 112-114, 24 May 2007, and Lamazhyk v. Russia, no. 20571/04, §§ 104-106, 30 July 2009). By contrast, the length of appeal proceedings that lasted ten, eleven and sixteen days was found to be compatible with the “speediness” requirement of Article 5 § 4 (see Yudayev v. Russia, no. 40258/03, §§ 84-87, 15 January 2009, and Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247). Finally, the Court reiterates that the delay for which the State may be held responsible should not include the time when the defence was preparing their brief of appeal (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247), unless the defence was prevented from finalising it through the fault of the authorities (see Lebedev (no. 1), § 100)."

In that case the Court held that delays of forty-four and sixty-seven days, of which twenty-seven and forty ‑ seven were attributable to the authorities, constituted a breach of Article 5 § 4 (see §§ 98-108). During the period now under examination the detention order of 10 September 2004 was reviewed within twenty-three days, if calculated from the date when the brief of appeal was introduced (see paragraphs 49 et seq. above). The detention order of 14 December 2004 was reviewed by the City Court within twenty-six days. The detention order of 2 March 2005 was examined by the City Court within twenty days from the date when the brief of appeal had been introduced, and only twelve days out of this period can be attributed to the State, since the defence requested an adjournment of the appellate hearing."

In Mamedova a similar delay was found to be in breach of Article 5 § 4, and the Court does not see any reason to hold otherwise in the present case. The Court has not overlooked that the applicant in casu introduced his appeal during the period of long public holidays (New Year and Orthodox Christmas).

France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998-III; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII)."

Russia, no. 30024/02, § 182, 3 May 2011).

Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant’s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co-accused’s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court’s assessment of the applicant’s guilt. In Poppe, cited above, the Court found it decisive that the applicant’s name had been mentioned only in passing in the judgments against the co ‑ accused and that the trial judges had not determined whether the applicant was guilty of having committed an offence."

In that case the judgment in the applicant’s case contained a reference to a judgment rendered earlier in the case of his brother, who was a member of the same gang, but only in passing. There was no direct evidence that the findings of the previous judgment were relied on by the judge in the proceedings against the applicant. What is more, Article 90 of the CCrP clearly stipulated that those findings could not have the force of res judicata in the applicant’s case. The judge sitting in the applicant’s case was required to conduct a fresh examination of the charges against him, relying only on the evidence examined at his trial."

The court in the case of the applicant’s brother did not determine whether the applicant was guilty, and there was no specific qualification of the acts committed by him. The Court further held as follows:",
                "“Indeed, several witnesses named the applicant as the leader of the gang and described his role in some of the episodes imputed to [his brother]. That information was reproduced in the judgment; however, it was presented in the judgment as reported speech, and not as the court’s own findings. It can be seen from the judgment that the information about the applicant’s involvement in the gang was not a condition sine qua non for the conviction of [the applicant’s brother]. At least, there is no indication that the Nikulinskiy District Court would not have come to the same conclusions in [the applicant’s brother’s] case if all references to the applicant’s name had been removed. These circumstances lead the Court to conclude that the judgment in [the applicant’s brother’s] case did not contain findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant’s guilt in subsequent proceedings”.",

Thus, in the applicants’ case Judge Kolesnikova, under the Russian law, had been in no way bound by her earlier findings in the case of Mr Shakhnovskiy (see paragraph 387 above). She had to reconsider the whole case with all the issues raised by the case remaining open. Further, the judgment in the applicants’ case did not refer to the case of Mr Shakhnovskiy."

Although the Shakhnovskiy judgment did not establish the applicants’ guilt, their names were mentioned in a somewhat incriminating context. Thus, the central proposition of the Shakhnovskiy judgment was the fictitious character of his relations with Status Services. This was based on a number of other interim factual findings, including the fact that Mr Aleksanyan had given a legal opinion to the first applicant, describing the individual entrepreneur’s scheme, the fact that the second applicant had been a chief executive of Status Services, and the fact that an identical service contract had existed between the second applicant and Status Services (see paragraph 142 above)."

It appears that at least the first two items of evidence were discovered by the prosecution during the searches in the Yukos premises in Zhukovka in October 2003 (see paragraphs 69 et seq. above). The Court notes that the defence in the case at hand tried to obtain the exclusion of materials obtained during those searches (see paragraph 173 above). By admitting that evidence in Mr Shakhnovskiy’s proceedings the judge implicitly acknowledged the lawfulness of the searches and seizures which led to the discovery of that evidence."

The applicants and their lawyers repeatedly signed forms acknowledging that they had been allowed to study the materials of the case without any time restrictions. The applicants’ defence teams were allocated special rooms in the remand prison in order to enable them to prepare for the trial. These rooms were equipped with safe-boxes, where the defence was allowed to keep the materials of the case-file. The applicants were studying the materials in parallel with their lawyers; according to a letter from the head of the remand prison, the defence could ask the administration to make copies of the materials in the case file. In addition, the applicants were entitled to make notes and take materials from the case file to their cells, and transmit written comments to the lawyers, under the conditions established in sections 17, 18, 20 and 21 of the Detention on Remand Act. The second applicant had always had paper, writing accessories and law books at his disposal.

When any new material was added to the case file during the trial, the court always adjourned the hearing and provided the defence with an opportunity to study it. Throughout the entire trial the applicants and their lawyers had access to the materials of the case file.

The second applicant’s case-file contained 164 volumes, each volume contained 250 pages on average, i.e. there were about 41,000 pages in total. Two bills of indictment constituted another two volumes. At the trial, after the two cases had been joined, the first applicant received 22 working days to study 165 volumes of case materials from the second applicant’s case, whereas the second applicant had to study 228 additional volumes within that period. The bill of indictment had covered a period of over ten years, and the case was extremely complex, both legally and factually. Although there was a commonality in the charges faced by the applicants there were also significant differences. It was therefore imperative for the applicant’s lawyers to scrutinise the additional materials. Some documents, of course, appeared in both sets of files, but it was necessary to look through all of the volumes to understand which documents had already been studied and which had not."

In addition, the defence had only been permitted to use certain meeting rooms, even when others were vacant, which was very suspicious. The Government’s assertion that the applicant was able to give written comments to his lawyers was misleading, in as much as it omitted to mention the fact that all such comments had had to be passed through a special division of the detention facility - i.e. lawyer ‑ client confidentiality had systemically been violated.

The applicants had been entitled to read the case file only in the presence of the investigator. When the applicants wished to discuss the documents in private with their lawyers the investigator had removed the documents. The temporary absence of a magnifying glass and a calculator had seriously impaired the preparation of the defence of the second applicant. The applicants were very largely reliant on the notes that they had made when they were reviewing the case files in the presence of the investigator.

Those restrictions will be analysed separately under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention. However, they were not such as to make it impossible for the applicants to obtain the assistance of their lawyers in examining the case file and ascertaining the position of the prosecution before the start of the trial."

                "582. Secondly, the Court notes that the applicants were able to keep handwritten notes and use them at the trial. Furthermore, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004 there was a possibility for the defence lawyers to make copies of the materials. The Court previously held that unrestricted use of any notes and the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents were important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court’s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, §§ 59 and 63, 24 April 2007; Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, §§ 64 and 68, 15 January 2008; and Moiseyev, cited above, § 217). However, the applicants in the present case, unlike in Matyjek or Moiseyev, were not bound by any rules on State secrets; they could make notes and keep their notebooks with them, and their lawyers were allowed to make copies of pages from the case file, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004."

Their ability to absorb and analyse information was necessarily above average; they knew the business processes at the heart of the case and were, arguably, more competent in those matters than any other participants in the proceedings. Their professional status is also an additional factor in favour of the Court’s finding that the applicants’ inability to study every document personally was somehow compensated by their lawyers’ participation in examination of the case file: it must have been natural for the applicants, as senior managers, to delegate certain tasks to their lawyers."

For example, contracts between Yukos and its affiliates were important only in so far as they contained information about the price of oil and about the parties involved. It follows that the applicants did not need to read every page of such contracts in order to counter the prosecution’s arguments. As transpires from the judgment in the applicants’ case, a large part of the materials in both cases must have been identical. This means that in reality the number of pages which the applicants needed to scrutinise after the joinder of the two cases was less than the overall number of pages in each co-defendant’s case."

As to the “time and facilities” allocated to the defence during the trial, the Court observes that the timing of the hearings during the first stage of the trial proceedings, when the prosecution was presenting their case, was indeed more relaxed and made greater allowance for the preparation of arguments by the parties. However, the timing changed and the hearings became more intensive as soon as the court began examining evidence by the defence. Thus, without any apparent reason the court started hearings much earlier in the day (see paragraph 157 above) and discontinued the practice of Wednesday recesses (see paragraph 158 above)."

The Court observes that the appeal proceedings lasted from 31 May 2005 (the date when the Meshchanskiy District Court finished reading out its judgment) to 22 September 2005 (the date when the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment in the main part). The defence obtained a copy of the first-instance court judgment on 7 June 2005; the fifteen volumes containing the hearing record (which ran to over five thousand pages) were made available to the defence on 28 July 2005. The appeal hearing took place on 22 September 2005 (see paragraphs 278, 279 and 306 above). After lodging a preliminary brief of appeal the defence had the opportunity to supplement it (see paragraph 293 above). Thus, the defence team had three months and sixteen days to prepare written pleadings and to prepare for an oral argument, which appears to be a sufficient time, at least on the face of it. The Court’s analysis, however, cannot stop here: it must ascertain whether that time was sufficient in view of the specific conditions in which the defence had to prepare their appeal and whether the defence had all necessary facilities for that purpose."

Russia, no. 63378/00, § 81, 20 January 2005; Trepashkin, cited above, § 167). The Court notes that from 8 August 2005 the first applicant was detained in a “common” cell. In Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) the Court found that the conditions of detention in that cell amounted to “inhuman and degrading treatment” within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (§§ 117 et seq.). On 18 August 2005 the second applicant was placed for one week in an isolation cell where it was impossible to work with the case (see paragraph 473 above). On 15 September 2005 both cells in which the applicants were detained were placed under the quarantine regime (see paragraph 301 above); as a result, the applicants were unable to meet with their lawyers for some time. All that must have impeded the applicants’ preparation for the appellate hearing."

The applicants further claimed that before finalising their submissions to the court of appeal the defence had to verify the accuracy of the trial record and read materials added in the course of the trial. The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial (see Yukos, cited above, § 538). The Court accepts that studying a trial record and other trial materials may be a necessary phase in the preparation of a brief of appeal, especially where, as in the case at hand, the defence questions the lower courts’ findings of fact and challenges procedural decisions made during the trial, and where the court of appeal does not conduct a full rehearing of the case but bases its conclusions on written materials contained in the case file (see, mutatis mutandis, Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 107, 16 November 2006). The Court will therefore examine whether the defence was given sufficient time to study the trial materials."

The remaining volumes were not available to the defence, apparently because GPO was using them. Those volumes contained a number of the court’s procedural rulings and some documentary evidence added during the trial. The remaining volumes were given to the defence some time later, but the applicants were silent on that point and the Government did not comment either. The Court is prepared to admit that the defence had to prepare their appeal initially without having the entirety of the trial materials before them.

The Court is not in a position to say whether this was really so. It is, however, worrying that the defence’s written submissions on the trial record were dismissed by the domestic judge in a summary manner. The judge refused to consider the audiotapes made by the defence throughout the trial (see paragraph 287 above) and held in essence that she trusted her secretaries and her own memory better than the audiotapes (see paragraph 291 above). The Court accepts that audio-recording is not the only possible method of keeping track of proceedings. However, the case at hand was extremely complex, the trial lasted for nearly a year, seven secretaries were employed to keep the summary record, and hearings were held almost every day. In such circumstances it is difficult to believe that in all 126 pages of the defence’s written submissions, based on the audiotapes they had made, there was not a single accurate remark worthy of attention and that the secretaries’ diligence and the judge’s memory were infallible. In addition, the date of the appellate hearing was set by the Chairman of the Meshchanskiy District Court before Judge Kolesnikova had ruled on the defence’s objections to the trial record (see paragraph 290 above). This all leads the Court to the conclusion that the objections to the trial record were not considered seriously, and that the accuracy of the trial record is, therefore, open to doubt."

That “disadvantaged position” need not necessarily be analysed in terms of the equality-of-arms guarantee, primarily because the Court does not know whether the prosecution had any problems with access to and the accuracy of the trial materials. The situation may, however, be assessed alone, in the light of the principle of adversarial proceedings, which means, inter alia, that the defence must have a possibility to put arguments on all pertinent points, including “the elements ... which relate to procedure” (see Dowsett, cited above)."

Austria, cited above, § 50). The defence must be able to put relevant arguments so as to influence the outcome of the proceedings. In the circumstances the Court considers that possible inaccuracies in the trial record and the defence’s temporary inability to obtain access to part of the trial materials did not make it impossible for the defence to formulate their arguments and did not, therefore, influence the outcome of the appeal proceedings. The applicants’ conviction was based on various items of evidence, including a large amount of documentary evidence and statements from dozens of witnesses. Even acknowledging that the trial record may have contained some inaccuracies, the Court is not persuaded that they were such as to render the conviction unsafe. Furthermore, the defence were aware of the procedural decisions that had been taken during the trial and what materials had been added.

The Government further stressed that pursuant to point 27 of the Remand Prisons Rules (Decree of the Ministry of Justice of 12 May 2000, no. 148) lawyers were prohibited from accepting “letters of private character” from detainees. In the case at hand it was not a private letter which was seized, but a note which contained instructions to commit unlawful actions. That note had contained a plan of actions for the defence.

In addition, the note had contained the following instructions to the first applicant’s lawyers: “to address the issue with witnesses”; “as to the participation in RTT, Lebedev must give a negative answer”, “to address the issue of fees received for the consulting services”, “to obtain evidence [from the defence witnesses] that there was no criminal intent, and that Mr Lebedev did not give any orders on the methods of investment and taxation”.

Under Article 275 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code the applicants were entitled to use notes, which had to be shown to the presiding judge if he or she so requested. The presiding judge had explained to the defence that all transmitted documents should first be shown to her for inspection, to which Mr Padva, one of the first applicant’s lawyers, replied “Sure, by all means”. The judge needed to inspect notes transmitted from the applicants to their lawyers in order to decide whether they were related to the criminal proceedings, and in order to prevent the applicants giving their lawyers personal letters and similar documents that were not relevant to the case. The judge did not object to the contacts between the applicants and the lawyers during the breaks and even in the course of the hearing (to the extent that these did not pose a problem for the normal course of the hearing), but insisted on inspecting written documents passed between them. That measure was accepted by Mr Padva, who had said: “I will print out [those documents and notes] and show them to you”.

Those documents were subsequently widely used by the investigators.

It was indisputably established before the Meshchanskiy District Court that a number of documents were seized directly from Mr Drel, a defence lawyer in the criminal case, shortly before the second applicant’s arrest on 25 October 2003; these concerned the first applicant’s tax affairs and advice given to the applicant in connection with the case being conducted at that time against the second applicant, who by that time had already been in detention for more than three months. Since the first applicant’s name was mentioned in the charges against the second applicant – and the charges subsequently brought against them were virtually identical – Mr Drel, at the first applicant’s request, had formulated the applicant’s defence position in the event of identical charges being brought against him.

The record of the search of Ms Artyukhova indicates that the search was conducted under section 34 (6) of the Detention on Remand Act. According to this section, a search can only be conducted if there are sufficient grounds for suspecting individuals of attempting to smuggle in prohibited items, substances or food. It was claimed in the report following Ms Artyukhova’s search that the duty officer saw that “the lawyer and the defendant were repeatedly passing to each other notepads with some notes, making notes therein from time to time”. There were thus no legal grounds for conducting a search of Ms Artyukhova, because there was no indication in the report that the officer witnessed any attempt to pass any prohibited items, substances or food."

However, the search of and subsequent seizure from Mr Shmidt occurred when he was leaving the remand prison, and it could not therefore be alleged that the measures were designed to prevent prohibited items being brought into it. The applicants noted that that as a consequence of the search the Ministry of Justice demanded that disbarment proceedings be instigated against Mr Shmidt. The St Petersburg Bar Association subsequently exonerated Mr Shmidt at the disciplinary proceedings and determined that Mr Shmidt was entitled to take the document in and out of the remand prison and that the document was legally privileged."

The court declined to intervene, notwithstanding its overriding duty under the CCrP to ensure the fairness of its proceedings. However, the applicants were not violent. They had never attempted to escape. It was difficult to see what possible reason that there could have been for such a restriction, save to ensure that their discussions could be overheard. At a key phase in the trial (when the applicants’ defence was being presented) the court eliminated the Wednesday recess, which had been the primary opportunity for the applicants and their lawyers to communicate. The defence complained to the Meshchanskiy District Court about the inability to discuss matters confidentially in the court room on a significant number of occasions. The trial court refused to alter the arrangements in any way, simply stating that the defence were able to discuss matters confidentially during the adjournments. The District Court took the view that the requirement that the defence lawyers stood at least one metre from the applicants in the cage “does not really have anything to do with the case”. The defence raised those issues in the brief of appeal, but the Moscow City Court did not even address this aspect of the appeal in its decision."

As to Ms Khrunova and Ms Mikhailova, they were both authorised by the first applicant to act for him, in relation to the criminal proceedings as well as the applicant’s case before the Court. The Government’s reliance on Articles 62 and 72 of the CCrP was misconceived. Those provisions related to a lawyer’s participation in the trial, and did not govern the right of a lawyer to see his client. Section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act contained the applicable law in relation to access to a lawyer and provided that an accused was permitted to receive visits from his lawyer “with no limitation of their number or duration”. Moreover, Section 18 expressly stated that “visits shall be granted to a defence lawyer upon presentation of a lawyer’s ID and an authorisation. Demanding other documents from a lawyer is prohibited”. There was no requirement under domestic law for the trial court to “validate” a lawyer before he or she was permitted access to a client who had already authorised that lawyer to represent him or her in the proceedings. The remand prison officials’ insistence that the applicant’s lawyers had to be authorised by the trial court before they were permitted to see the first applicant was particular to his case and was unlawful."

In order to decide whether Article 6 § 3 (c) was complied with the Court does not need to know what happened after those proceedings were over, i.e. after the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 22 September 2005.

Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, § 97, 2 November 2010). An accused’s right to communicate with his advocate out of hearing of a third person is part of the basic requirements of a fair trial. If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, “his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective” (see S. v. Switzerland, 28 November 1991, § 48, Series A no. 220). Any interference with privileged material, and, a fortiori, the use of such material against the accused in the proceedings should be exceptional, be justified by a pressing need and will always be subjected to the strictest scrutiny by this Court (see Khodorkovskiy (no.1), § 198)."

From the search record itself it is clear that the investigators knew that they were entering a law firm’s office and were seizing the working files of a lawyer who represented the applicants (see, in particular, paragraph 71 above). Thus, by searching in Mr Drel’s office and seizing his working files the authorities deliberately interfered with the secrecy of the lawyer-client contacts protected under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see André and Other v.

At the relevant time Mr Drel was not under suspicion of any kind. Most significantly, the search in Mr Drel’s office was not accompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards, for example a court warrant, as required by the Advocacy Act and confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 398 and 399 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan, cited above, § 214; Golovan v.

Such limitations, however, had no firm basis in domestic law. Thus, the legislation referred to by the Government regulated the correspondence of detainees with the outside world (“telegrams [and] letters” or “proposals, declarations and complaints” - see section 20 of the Detention on Remand Act, sections 84, 86, 91 and 99 of the Internal Regulations). It also mentioned “objects, substances and foodstuff” which the detainees were not allowed to have or to use (see sections 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and, in particular, section 27 of the Internal Regulations, which associates “objects” with physical objects rather than documents, or Article 19.12 of the Code of Administrative Offences). The Court has doubts as to whether the drafts or notes made by a lawyer during a meeting with his or her client could be qualified as “correspondence” or “prohibited objects” within the meaning of the Detention on Remand Act or the Internal Regulations. The Government did not specify what set of rules applied to the notes and to other written materials which the applicants might have exchanged with their lawyers during the meetings, and the Court cannot accept that the law was applied by extension in such a sensitive area as intereference with privileged materials of the defence. The Court reiterates in this respect that any limitations imposed on a detainee concerning his contacts with lawyers should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K. v.

Furthermore, even assuming that the Russian law at the time prevented the defence from keeping and exchanging notes during the meetings, the Court is not persuaded that such a measure was necessary in the applicants’ case. Secrecy of written communications is no less important than the secrecy of oral exchanges, especially where the case is factually and legally complex. As follows from the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29 November 2010 (see paragraph 396 above), notes, drafts, outlines, action plans, etc. prepared by the lawyer for or during a meeting with his detained client are to all intents and purposes privileged material. In addition, as noted by the Constitutional Court, certain exceptions from the general principle of confidentiality are permissible, but only if the authorities have a reasonable cause to believe that the professional privilege is being abused. The Court fully subscribes to this position. The Court reiterates that in Campbell, cited above, it stressed that the prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer should not be “susceptible to routine scrutiny”. Such correspondence can be opened only when the prison authorities have “reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure”. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The reading of a prisoner’s mail to and from a lawyer should only be permitted “in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature” (§ 48)."

In the present case the authorities took as their starting point the opposite presumption, namely that all written communications between any detained person and his lawyer were suspect. This went so far as to assimilate “correspondence” with written notes made by the lawyers in preparation for the meetings with the client or during them. The only way for the defence to overcome that presumption was to submit their working papers to the prison authorities for inspection, i.e. to reveal their arguments to a body which could hardly be regarded as independent, and which was required by law to communicate all suspicious correspondence to the investigative authorities (see paragraph 392 above)."

However, the fact that a criminal defendant is detained is not sufficient to subject all of his written communications with his lawyers to perusal, and that for an indefinite period of time and without any justification specific for that particular case. The Court has repeatedly condemned the practice of “indiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant’s correspondence” with his lawyer (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005; see also Kepeneklioğlu v. Turkey, no. 73520/01, § 31, 23 January 2007). This is a fortiori true in respect of papers brought by the lawyer to a meeting with his client or prepared during the meeting. To have a reasonable cause for interfering with the confidentiality of lawyer-client written communications the authorities must have something more than a sweeping presumption that lawyers always conspire with their clients in disregard of the rules of professional ethics and despite the serious sanctions which such behaviour entails."

Switzerland, cited above, § 47, see also Kröcher and Möller v. Switzerland, no. 8463/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1981, DR 26, p. 40).

There were no ascertainable facts showing that the applicants’ lawyers might abuse their professional privilege. The Court stresses that the measures complained of were not limited to the first days or weeks after the applicants’ arrest, when the risk of tampering with evidence, collision or re-offending was arguably higher, but lasted for over two years. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the rule whereby working documents of the defence, drafts, notes etc. were subject to perusal and could have been confiscated if not checked by the prison authorities beforehand was unjustified.

However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence’s rights under Article 6 § 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v.

At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the “security plan” implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge’s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her.

The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants’ case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, § 67) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners’ correspondence). In the Court’s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge’s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial."

In the light of the materials of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the applicants’ account in this respect (see, in particular, paragraphs 151 and 154 above). In particular, the Court notes that the lawyers were not allowed to come closer than 50 cm to their clients when they wished to speak to them, and that escort officers were always standing in close proximity.

Thus, for example, in assessing limitations imposed on the defence in the case of Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012), the Court applied a quantitative approach and held as follows (§ 92):",
                "“The security arrangements [i.e. placement of the accused in a metal cage] undeniably limited communication between the applicant and his lawyer during the hearing. These limitations did not, however, amount to a complete lack of communication between the applicant and his lawyer; the applicant did not demonstrate that it was impossible to request that the lawyer’s seat be brought closer to his “cage”, or that they had been denied an opportunity for private communication when necessary.”",
                "In contrast with Titarenko, in the present case the applicants did not have “an opportunity for private communication” with their lawyers, due to the permanent presence of escort officers near the metal cage and the minimal distance the lawyers had to respect. The fact that the defence was able to request adjournments during the hearings is irrelevant: it appears that even during those adjournments the lawyers were unable to discuss the case with their clients anywhere but in the hearing room, i.e. in the close vicinity of the prison guards. The Court concludes that even though the applicants benefited from legal assistance by several lawyers, the secrecy of their exchanges, both oral and written, was seriously impaired during the hearings."

The Russian courts at two instances had examined the objections of the defence as to the admissibility of a large number of items of evidence and dismissed them. The fact that the defence had not been satisfied with the decisions of the domestic courts in this respect did not mean that the principle of equality of arms had been breached."

As regards other evidence relied on by the prosecution, the Government asserted that all of the evidence had been obtained lawfully, and that the premises in Zhukovka where the searches had been conducted had not been lawyers’ offices and thus protected by lawyers’ professional privilege. The Government maintained that the court had verified the admissibility of the evidence obtained during the search and found it to be lawfully obtained. The judgment contained the court’s reasoning on that point. The Government further noted that the question of admissibility of evidence had been discussed in the subsequent proceedings on appeal and during the supervisory review appeal. The defence had been able to present their view on the issue of the admissibility of various pieces of evidence. Occasionally, the requests and motions of the defence were satisfied; in other instances the court took the side of the prosecution. The District Court was acting in compliance with the provisions of Article 50 (2) of the Russian Constitution, which provides that unlawfully obtained evidence cannot be used in criminal proceedings. In any event, even when the prosecution objected, the defence had a right to call and question their witnesses."

In so far as the questioning of witnesses by the prosecution during the trial was concerned, the Government maintained that several witnesses for the prosecution in the first criminal case had indeed been questioned again within the framework of another criminal case, which had been severed from the first case and investigated separately. Their testimony so obtained had not been used within the criminal case under examination. They denied that such practice amounted to putting undue pressure on the witnesses."

With regard to the experts for the prosecution, the Government indicated that witnesses Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov had not been witnesses but “expert witnesses” whose appearance at the trial had been requested by the defence in order to calculate the amount of damage allegedly caused by the applicant to the State. Under Russian law, an expert is a person who has specialised knowledge in an area where the judge has no competence."

In the circumstances the presence of an expert in those matters had not been necessary. Further, questioning of an expert was always preceded by the preparation of a report by that expert. An expert could not be questioned if he had not earlier produced a written expert opinion. At the same time, the law allowed a written expert opinion (report) to be admitted to the materials of the case file without subsequent questioning of the expert who had prepared it. The judge in this case decided that there had been no grounds for calling the experts for questioning. It was the court’s task to establish the amount of damage, and the court had all the necessary information for that purpose. The District Court noted that the final assessment of the conclusions of the report by Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov could be made only at the conclusive stage of the proceedings, when the court had deliberated and developed its position. The Government submitted that the same was true in respect of the expert Mr Shulgin."

The defence had submitted to the District Court expert reports by Mr Shchekin, Ms Petrova, Mr Semenov, and Mr Lubenchenko. Those reports contained analysis of tax and banking legislation and accounting procedures and practices, criticism of the conclusions of the prosecution authorities, analysis of the lawfulness of audit reports issued by the tax authorities in the case in respect of the companies allegedly affiliated with the applicants, etc. The reports of those “expert witnesses” contained conclusions of a legal nature about the applicants’ guilt, analysis of the arguments of the prosecution, of evidence, interpretation of the applicable law etc., which was not an expert’s task under Russian law. On those grounds the District Court decided not to admit reports from those persons, on the ground that they were “inadmissible evidence”."

Furthermore, an “expert witness” had to receive a formal warning about his rights and obligations in the procedure; a defence lawyer could not, by virtue of his status, give such a formal warning, this being the prerogative of an investigator or a judge. Mr Grechishkin, Mr Shchekin and Mr Semenov made their conclusions on the basis of photocopies of documents which had not been “properly certified” as true copies. According to the defence, those documents had been copies from the case file in the applicants’ case. However, those “expert witnesses” had not been given access to the originals of the materials in the case file. In addition, as the District Court established in the course of the proceedings, Mr Shchekin had obtained some “additional materials” from the defence lawyers.

At the request of the court, Mr Shchekin enumerated pages of the report which he had prepared personally and those which had not been written by him. Mr Shchekin gave his interpretation of the tax law. On 25 January 2005 Mr Rivkin requested the court to admit in evidence an “expert report” by Mr Semenov. The “expert report” was attached to the materials of the case (without attachments, since they mostly consisted of extracts from the applicable law and decisions of the commercial courts which had not been “properly certified”). Mr Semenov testified about the conditions in which he had prepared his written report. The court, having examined their evidence, concluded in the judgment that those two persons could not be considered as “expert witnesses”, since they did not have the necessary specialist knowledge. Thus, they had never worked in any State tax authority or in an audit firm, with the exception of Mr Shchekin, who had worked as a lawyer for four months in 1996 in a State tax service. Those two persons were in fact lawyers and/or law professors. However, the court did not require their commentaries and interpretations of the law.

The Court reiterates that it belongs primarily to the national courts to decide whether, on the facts of the case, a particular item of evidence could be considered as a reliable source of information. Nevertheless, where the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy, reliance on such evidence may undermine the overall fairness of the proceedings (see Jalloh v.

Accordingly, when the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors were required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 119 and 147)."

By contrast, the Court must examine the refusal to hear Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kuprianov, since their evidence was seemingly relevant to the charges on which the applicants were found guilty. The Government argued that Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kuprianov were not “witnesses” within the meaning of Article 6 § 3 (d), but “experts”, i.e. persons with specialist knowledge who assisted the court in a particular technical or scientific filed. The Court agrees that the role of an expert witness in the proceedings can be distinguished from that of an eye-witness who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. That does not mean, however, that testing of expert evidence is not covered by Article 6 § 3 (d) taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 1. There is an extensive case-law of the Court which guarantees to the defence a right to study and challenge not only an expert report as such but also the credibility of those who have prepared it, through their direct questioning (see, amongst other authorities, Brandstetter v.

The Court cannot accept this argument. Both Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov were hired as experts by the prosecution at the investigation stage and conducted their expert examination at the premises of the GPO, without any involvement of the defence (compare with Zarb v.

Consequently, their position was closer to that of a “prosecution witness”. Contrary to the situation with defence witnesses, the accused is not required to demonstrate the importance of a prosecution witness. If the prosecution decides that a particular person is a relevant source of information and relies on his or her testimony at the trial (see paragraph 165 above), and if the testimony of that witness is used by the court to support a guilty verdict (which was the case – see paragraph 271 above), it must be presumed that his or her personal appearance and questioning are necessary, unless the testimony of that witness is manifestly irrelevant or redundant."

There is nothing in the judgment of the District Court to counter that assumption. The defence explained to the District Court why they had doubts about the reliability of the expert reports and the methods employed by the experts (see paragraph 169 above).

Although “Article 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence” (see Mirilashvili, cited above, § 225), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence “under the same conditions” as the prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 33, Series A no. 274; see also Perić, cited above, § 19).

However, as follows from the text of Article 6 § 3 (d) the defence must have an opportunity to conduct an active defence – for example, by calling witnesses on its behalf or adducing other evidence."

The reports were obtained within the preliminary investigation, i.e. not in adversarial proceedings, and, in this case, without any participation of the defence. Thus, the defence was unable to formulate questions to the experts, challenge the experts or propose their own experts for inclusion in the team, etc. The trial court admitted those reports in evidence because under the CCrP the prosecution had a right to collect them."

Indeed, in theory the defence could challenge an expert report produced by the prosecution and ask the court to commission a fresh expert examination. However, to obtain such a fresh examination it was incumbent on the defence to persuade the court that the report produced by the prosecution was incomplete or deficient. The Court notes that the defence was unable to call some of the experts who had prepared the reports at the request of the prosecution, and to cast doubt on their credibility. That fact gave rise to a separate finding of a violation under Article 6 § 3 (d) (see paragraph 716 above) and it undoubtedly made the defence’s task of proving the usefulness of the counter-reports more difficult."

The CCrP, as interpreted by the District Court, did not allow the defence to collect written reports by “experts” or “specialists”. The defence lawyers were indeed able to obtain consultations from relevant specialists outside the trial, but this does not suffice to equalise the positions of the prosecution and the defence.

Although a specialist may “explain to the parties and to the court matters which come within his or her professional competence”, his primary role is to assist the court and the parties in conducting investigative actions which require special skills or knowledge (see paragraph 402 above). In any event, the defence would only be able to rely on oral questioning of the “specialists” at the trial, whereas the prosecution was able to produce written reports prepared beforehand by “experts”. Finally, as transpires from the Meshchanskiy District Court’s reasoning, “specialists” invited by the defence, unlike “experts” for the prosecution, did not have direct access to the original copy of the case file, and the court was not prepared to admit their conclusions based on the copies of materials of the case provided to them by the defence (see paragraph 252 above)."

The Government stressed that the applicants, as businessmen, could have solicited the opinion of the most experienced lawyers. In addition, the first applicant held two university degrees. It was hard to believe that the applicants had never assessed the risks related to their business activities in Russia, including the risks in the sphere of criminal law.

Tax evasion, a crime proscribed by Articles 198 and 199 of the Code, was a deliberate act, aimed at the default in payment of taxes and dues in large or very large amounts which led to the partial or complete non-receipt of those taxes and dues by the treasury. There could be different methods of tax evasion. For example, it could occur in the form of a deliberate and knowing indication of false information in the tax declaration or in other documents which the taxpayer must submit to the tax authority in accordance with the law. “Other documents” in this context meant any documents necessary for the calculation of the taxes due. “Deliberate” meant the existence of a direct intent to give false information. “False information” was understood as any incorrect data about the object of the tax (i.e. property, revenue or other operations and status), about the right to tax deductions, credits etc., which could affect the correctness of the calculation of the amount due by the taxpayer. “Indication of the false information” could take the form of the taxpayer’s failure to indicate the true amount of his revenues; artificial minimisation of revenues or increase of deductible costs; falsification of data on the time period when certain revenues were received or losses suffered; distortion of physical characteristics of a particular type of business activity, etc."

The Government further referred to the opinion of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which noted that tax-evasion schemes were quite widespread and were constantly developing, becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, which called for the enactment of new laws penalising particular types of conduct. Their report on money laundering in 1999-98 mentioned the use of offshore companies as a common tax-evasion technique. The Financial Action Task Force continued to discover new forms of tax evasion every year; however, this could not preclude the States from bringing the persons responsible for tax evasion to criminal liability.

The central question was therefore whether such schemes had been discovered and penalised in any other case before the applicants were brought to trial. The Government asserted that the tax-evasion schemes used by the applicants were “relatively new” and were discovered only in the course of the investigation into the applicants’ case. Thus, the sham companies were registered and functioned on the territories enjoying a special taxation regime. However, the ZATO Act clearly established criteria which permitted companies incorporated and registered in those locations to use that special regime. In order to benefit from tax cuts the companies had to have up to 90 per cent of their fixed assets and 70 per cent of their human resources concentrated in those territories. Seventy per cent of the wage-fund was supposed to be paid to locally-hired employees. The companies which were buying oil from Yukos did not correspond to those requirements; consequently, they obtained tax cuts unlawfully and caused damage to the State. The provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation which applied to the applicants’ case were clear and did not change.

Then they entered into the consulting agreements with an intermediary company. Those agreements were related to a separate arrangement with a non-Russian end-user, tapping into the applicants’ expertise as regards the conducting of business in the Russian Federation. Given the sensitive nature of such arrangements they were indeed genuinely confidential, and it would have been a serious breach of faith for the applicants to have shared such matters with their prosecutors in a publicly conducted trial.

It follows that the offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied when the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it or by way of appropriate legal advice, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Liivik v.

Foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law concerned, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. A law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Scoppola v.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances” (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 234). The Court also reiterates that “the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice” (see Scoppola (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 100). Furthermore, in most of the member States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001-II; K.-H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, ECHR 2001-II (extracts); and Kononov v.

The Court did not find a violation of Article 7 in this case referring to the fact that the old distinction between “lawful” and “unlawful” involuntary sexual intercourse was clearly obsolete, that the new interpretation continued “a perceptible line of case-law development” and that “the essentially debasing character of rape” was so manifest that the judicial recognition of such behaviour as criminal was not “at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 of the Convention” (see §§ 42-44)."

The Court considers that its findings under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the Yukos case cannot be automatically applied to the applicants’ complaint under Article 7 in the present case.

It also complained that any existing legal basis for finding the company liable fell short of the Convention requirements in respect of the quality of the law and that, in any event, the application of the relevant laws contradicted established practice. Accordingly, the Court has to determine whether the relevant tax arrangements were domestically lawful at the time ... and whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable. ...",
                "591. ... The company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts ...",

The domestic courts found that [the tax minimisation technique applied by the company] was ... unlawful ..., as it involved the fraudulent registration of trading entities by the applicant company in the name of third persons and its corresponding failure to declare to the tax authorities its true relation to these companies .... The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety ...",

This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time .... The case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 .... Moreover, in a number of its rulings ... the Constitutional Court [mentioned] possible consequences of a taxpayer’s bad faith conduct.",

In so far as the applicant company complained that the bad faith doctrine had been too vague, the Court would again reiterate that ... many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice ... On the facts, ... the applicable legal norms made it quite clear that, if uncovered, a taxpayer faced the risk of tax reassessment of its actual economic activity in the light of the relevant findings of the competent authorities. And this is precisely what happened to the applicant company in the case at hand.",

The case of Chelpiks decided by the commercial courts of the Urals District implied that it was impossible to sue a taxpayer for the use of tax advantages granted by a preferential tax agreement without previously invalidating that agreement (see paragraph 436 above).

Be that as it may, the Court reiterates that Article 7 guarantees that criminal offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by substantive criminal law. It does not, however, set any requirements as to the procedure in which those offences must be investigated and brought to trial. The Court reiterates that in the case of Coëme and Others v. Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 149, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) it faced a somewhat similar claim by the applicants, who argued that Article 7 guaranteed not only the foreseeability of the punishment, but also the foreseeability of the prosecution. In that case the new law had extended the limitation period and thus prolonged the period of time during which prosecutions could be brought in respect of the offences imputed to the applicants. The Court admitted that the application of the new law “detrimentally affected the applicants’ situation, in particular by frustrating their expectations”, but that it did not “entail an infringement of the rights guaranteed by Article 7, since that provision cannot be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation”."

The Court observes that “tax evasion” is defined in Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code in very general terms (see paragraph 429 above). The Code describes tax evasion as “knowing” inclusion of “false data” in the fiscal declarations. By itself such a broad definition does not raise any issue under Article 7 of the Convention. Forms of economic activity are in constant development, and so are the methods of tax evasion. In order to define whether a particular behaviour amounts to “tax evasion” in the criminal-law sense the domestic courts may invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law.

The prosecution in the applicants’ case alleged that the applicants were submitting “false” information to the authorities. For many purposes “sham” is a synonym of “false”, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a “sham” transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as “knowingly” submitting “false information” to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code."

Some of the case-law referred to by the parties speak in favour of the Government’s position. In particular, in the cases of Mechel or Grin Haus (paragraphs 422 and 425 above) the courts re-characterised the transactions of taxpayers as “sham” at the request of the Tax Service."

                "798. The judgments in cases concerning transfer pricing in the low-tax zones were more supportive of the applicants’ position. An illustration is the case of the Tax Service v. OOO Pribrezhnoe (see paragraph 439 above), analysed in §§ 593-594 of the Yukos judgment. In that case a commercial court refused to recalculate taxes due by a company registered in the low-tax zone despite several factual elements indicative of the “sham” character of the operations of that company. Factual elements relied on by the Tax Service in the Pribrezhnoye case were very close to those relied on by the prosecution in the criminal case against the applicants. The domestic court accepted the documents submitted by the defendant (contracts, lists of personnel, payrolls, bills, etc.) at face value and rejected the prosecution’s arguments about the fictitious character of the impugned operations as unconvincing."

Energosintez (see paragraph 437 above), where the commercial court held in favour of the defendant company registered in a ZATO, despite the fact that industrial facilities for processing and transporting oil (which was the main business of that company) did not belong to the company and were located outside the territory of the ZATO. The court found those arguments irrelevant."

The Court notes that the cases of Pribrezhnoye and Energosintez may create an impression that the courts at the time were reluctant to apply the “substance-over-form” approach to transfer pricing arrangements. However, in the Court’s opinion, those cases were mostly decided on the facts. They cannot be construed as negating the power of the courts to invalidate a particular transaction as “sham”. Rather, the courts in those cases found that evidence produced by the Tax Service was insufficient to reach such a conclusion. The fact that in one or two cases the Tax Service failed to produce sufficient evidence and prove the fictitious character of a taxpayer’s operations does not mean that it would fail in all subsequent cases in respect of other taxpayers."

Similarly, the domestic court’s conclusions in the case of Siblekon relied on by the applicants (see paragraph 438 above) did not mean that the existence of a preferential tax agreement always relieves the taxpayer from liability for not paying taxes in full. The existence of such an agreement with the ZATO administration is a powerful argument strengthening the presumption that the taxpayer acted bona fide, but it does not give absolute immunity from possible re-characterisation of operations based on that agreement as “sham”."

Likewise, in the criminal-law sphere the question of whether a taxpayer knowingly misinformed the tax authorities about his operations is a factual question."

            [
                "805. The Court acknowledges that there are legitimate methods of tax minimisation: a company may organise its business processes in such a way as to benefit from special tax regimes. However, the tax-minimisation scheme deployed by Yukos was not fully transparent; some of the elements of the scheme were concealed from the authorities. Such behaviour by the taxpayer might have reasonably been construed as amounting to the submission of “false data” to the tax authorities within the meaning of the Criminal Code, which constitutes the actus reus of tax evasion."
            ],
            [
                "806. First, the Court observes that tax minimisation was the sole reason for the creation of the network of the trading companies in Lesnoy. It was not claimed by the applicants, neither in the domestic proceedings nor before this Court, that the trading companies were registered in Lesnoy in order to facilitate logistics, save on production costs, hire qualified staff, etc. As the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 593), “the arrangement [i.e. the tax minimisation scheme] was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices”."

                "807. Second, the Court observes that despite the formal domiciliation of the trading companies in Lesnoy, all business activities which generated profit were in fact carried out in Moscow. The trading companies presented themselves as real companies having assets and personnel in the low-tax zone; however, as was established in the domestic proceedings and later confirmed by the Court in the Yukos case (see § 591), all of the trading companies had virtually no assets or personnel in the ZATO, and had enjoyed no operational independence whatsoever from the Moscow headquarters. Thus, the trading companies claimed tax cuts as if they were really operating in the low-tax zone, but in reality they were merely registered there for form’s sake, and all the operations were conducted in Moscow."
            ],
            [
                "808. Third, the Court does not find any proof that the applicants ever informed the tax authorities about their true relation to the trading companies. Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received “gifts” from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of “market prices” in the relations between affiliated companies."
            ],
            [
                "809. The Court concludes that the applicants’ behaviour cannot be compared to that of a bona fide taxpayer who fails to declare his revenues or submit other relevant information due to some unintended omission or a genuine misinterpretation of the tax law. In the present case, whereas a part of the tax-minimisation scheme was visible to the authorities, the applicants misrepresented or concealed some important aspects of that scheme which arguably might have been crucial for defining eligibility of the trading companies to tax cuts."

            [
                "810. The applicants also challenged the finding of the domestic courts to the effect that they (the applicants) had played a leading role in mounting and managing the impugned tax-optimisation scheme. In the opinion of the Court it is difficult to imagine that the applicants, as senior executives and co-owners of Yukos, were not aware of the entire transfer pricing arrangement and did not know that the information included in the fiscal reporting of the trading companies did not reflect the true nature of their operations (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros, cited above, § 59). Thus, the mens rea of the impugned crime was self-evident."

            [
                "811. The Court is not called upon to develop a comprehensive legal theory explaining the differences between legitimate tax-minimisation techniques and tax evasion. Similarly, it is impossible to set an exhaustive list of criteria for defining a particular operation or a company as “sham”. However, the cumulative effect of the elements discussed was sufficient to demonstrate that the operations of the trading companies were likely to be “sham”, that the reporting based thereon did not reflect the realities of the business operations, and that the applicants therefore “knowingly” submitted “false data” in order to reduce the overall tax burden of the company. Such inferences of fact were not “arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable”."

In so far as the personal income-tax evasion is concerned, the applicants claimed that in reality they had rendered consulting services to the two Isle of Man companies, i.e. Status Services and Hinchley and/or to the “end-users”. Again, this is a question of fact which was disputed in the domestic proceedings. If the “consultancy agreements” between the applicants and the Isle of Man companies were indeed “sham” or “fictitious” – and that was the finding of the domestic courts – one can reasonably consider that the applicants had knowingly submitted false data in their declarations, thus committing an offence under Article 198 of the Criminal Code."

The domestic courts, after having examined the evidence before them, concluded that the fees received by the applicants under the service agreements were de facto payment for the applicants’ work in Yukos and in the affiliated structures – payment which would normally be taxable under the general taxation regime. The applicants’ own explanations concerning their relations with the unnamed “end-users” were quite vague. Even though the applicants were allowed to remain silent, the overall picture of their relations with the two Isle of Man companies and/or “end-users” required some explanation, especially in the light of their parallel work as senior executives of Yukos, work for which they received only a symbolic compensation, and in view of other evidence discovered by the prosecution which showed the links between the applicants and the two Isle of Man companies. The provenance of the money paid by the Isle of Man companies under the “service agreements” – an element which the applicant considered as important – in the eyes of the domestic courts was not important for establishing the true purpose of those transfers, and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with this. In such circumstances the inferences made by the Russian courts as to the real nature of the payments received by the applicants from the two Isle of Man companies were not unreasonable or arbitrary."

Equally, the Court is unable to accept the applicants’ alternative argument, namely that by opting for a licence the applicants simply used a legitimate tax-minimisation technique falling short of tax evasion. The right to choose a particular mode of operation with a view to minimising taxes does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation to submit true information to the tax authorities. In the domestic proceedings (as well as before this Court) the applicants claimed that they had provided consulting services to various clients, including those not related to Yukos. Apparently, their tax declarations were formulated in similar terms. However, the Russian courts did not accept that assertion, holding that the sums received by the applicants had nothing to do with any consulting services but solely related to their work as senior executives in Yukos. In other words, the applicants did not inform the tax authorities of the true nature of their activities. This was clearly not an unintended or minor omission, or a simple misinterpretation of the tax law. In this respect the applicants’ situation was different from that of the defendant in the Vliran case they referred to (see paragraph 443 above)."

The applicants’ last line of argument also concerned their prosecution for tax evasion and the authorities’ attitude to such tax-minimisation schemes during the period when they operated. The applicants’ claimed that they had been the first to suffer from a novel interpretation of the criminal law, and that no other businessmen who had been using similar tax-minimisation techniques had been prosecuted and/or convicted for that. Furthermore, the tax-minimisation scheme operated on the basis of preferential tax agreements, and several tax assessments conducted in respect of the trading companies confirmed the lawfulness of the tax cuts.

However, this was not the case here, primarily because the reasons for such toleration are unclear. It is possible that the authorities simply did not have sufficient information or resources to prosecute the applicants and/or other businessmen for using such schemes. The Court does not exclude that similar “tax-optimisation techniques” might have been known to the tax authorities, for example from the FATF documents (see paragraph 750 above). It is also conceivable that a global analysis of money-flow and sales of Yukos oil might be suggestive of the use of some tax-minimisation techniques. However, there is no evidence that the tax authorities knew exactly what Yukos was doing; as the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 592):",

Thus, the Government insisted that the measure complained of was lawful. Under Article 73 of the CES a convict was entitled to serve his prison sentence in the same federal constituency where he was convicted (in the applicants’ case, Moscow). However, where this is impossible, the convict was sent to serve his sentence in a penal colony situated in the next closest federal constituency. Several regions of Russia (Moscow, St Petersburg and some republics of the Northern Caucasus) have no general-regime penal colonies. In order to avoid prison overcrowding and comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in the Court’s case-law in respect to prison conditions in Russia, convicts from those regions were sent to colonies situated in other regions. For example, convicts from Moscow often served their sentences even further from Moscow than the town of Krasnokamensk, where the first applicant had been sent. According to the Government, Article 73 of the CES “was complied with in the majority of the federal constituencies of the Russian Federation”. In many regions new penal colonies were being built. The applicants were treated in this respect in the same manner as any other convict in a similar situation. There were no grounds for giving the applicants preferential treatment because of their family or financial situation.

Of course, had the applicant been serving his sentence closer to his family, he would have been able to make far greater use of the facility for short visits. On account of the exhausting and demanding nature of the journey, his young twin sons were unable to visit him in Krasnokamensk at all.

Poland, no. 26761/95, 12 November 2002). The Court will not turn a blind eye to such limitations which go beyond what would normally be accepted in the case of an ordinary detainee. Thus, for example, it is an essential part of a prisoner’s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000-X). Limitations on contacts with other prisoners and with family members, imposed by prison rules, have been regarded by the Court as an “interference” with the rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 69, ECHR 2003-II)."

Thus, placing a convict in a particular prison may potentially raise an issue under Article 8 if its effects for the applicant’s private and family life go beyond “normal” hardships and restrictions inherent to the very concept of imprisonment. As the Commission already observed in Wakefield v. the United Kingdom (no. 15817/89, decision of 1 October 1990, DR 66, p. 251): “Article 8 requires the State to assist prisoners as far as possible to create and sustain ties with people outside prison in order to promote prisoners’ social rehabilitation. In this context the location of the place where a prisoner is detained is relevant”. Furthermore, the right to respect for family life imposes upon states a positive obligation to assist prisoners in maintaining effective contact with their close family members (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8 October 1982, DR 30, p. 115). In the context of imprisonment the Commission recognised that the possibility for close family members to visit a detainee constitutes an essential factor in the maintenance of family life (see Hacisuleymanoglou v. Italy no. 23241/94, decision of 20 October 1994, DR no. 79-B, p. 121)."

The Court reiterates that in the Wakefield case the Commission considered that the refusal to allow the applicant a permanent transfer from Yorkshire to Scotland to be near his fiancée had constituted an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for private life. In the present case the distances involved were much longer than those in Wakefield. Given the geographical situation of the colonies concerned, and the realities of the Russian transport system the Court has no difficulty in accepting that a trip from Moscow to the Krasnokamensk colony or the Kharp colony was a long and exhaustive endeavour, especially for the applicants’ young children. Indeed, it was not the applicants themselves but the members of their respective families who suffered from the remoteness of the colonies. Still, the applicants were affected by this measure, albeit indirectly, because they probably received fewer visits than they would have received had they been located closer to Moscow. In sum, the Court finds that this measure constituted an interference with the applicants’ Article 8 rights to privacy and family life.",

The Court is aware that the FSIN was the main regulatory body in the penitentiary system and, as such, was competent to decide matters related to transferrals of detainees. In such circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to review the findings of the Russian courts as to the lawfulness of the measure complained of. The Court is prepared to accept, for the purposes of the present case, that the interference with the applicants’ family and private lives was compatible with the domestic legal provisions.",

Before the Court the Government argued that sending the applicants to the two remote colonies pursued three aims: (a) preventing “unauthorised contacts with journalists”, and preventing “unauthorised rallies and picketing”, (b) protecting the applicants from other convicts or persons who might wish to take vengeance on them, (c) avoiding overcrowding in the prisons located in Moscow."

Thus, the Russian law provided for transferral of a detainee from one colony to another when his own safety required it. Furthermore, it is evident that the exception to the “geographical rule” applied to the applicants was aimed at combating prison overcrowding in certain regions. Those aims (guaranteeing safety of the convict and avoiding general overcrowding) are, in the opinion of the Court, “legitimate” under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention since they contribute to preventing “disorder and crime” and securing the “rights and freedoms” of others. It remains to be established whether the measure complained of was proportionate to those aims.",

However, the authorities did not refer to that ground in the domestic proceedings, and the courts consequently did not consider whether the applicants were exposed to any security risks. Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the general assumption that inmates in the Kharp or Krasnokamensk colonies were less dangerous for the applicants since these other inmates did not know who the applicants were: the applicants’ trial was the most mediatised trial of the recent decade and the first applicant’s wealth was well-known from many sources open to the general public. Finally, the Government’s assertion that unnamed “victims” of the applicants’ crimes would try to take vengeance on them did not have any factual basis - the principal victim of the crimes imputed to the applicants was the State itself. It follows that the measure complained of could not have been justified by the applicants’ own safety."

The Court is prepared to accept that given the size of the population in Moscow and the corresponding number of convicts from that city there were no free places for the applicants there. However, the rule set by Article 73 of the Code of Execution of Sentences was relatively clear and simple. It allowed sending a convict to the next closest region, not several thousand kilometres away."

The Court accepts that it was difficult to decide individually for every detainee from Moscow or another region affected by prison overcrowding where he or she must serve the sentence. It appears that in order to address that problem the FSIN came up with a general plan establishing quotas for the distribution of convicts amongst penitentiary colonies in different Russian regions (“federal constituencies”). The Government submitted to the Court a copy of that plan. However, the Government did not explain how that plan was prepared, and did not describe a method or algorithm of distribution of convicts used by the FSIN to draw that plan. The plan itself does not contain any information to that effect. It is consequently difficult to say to what extent the plan was compatible with the “geographical rule” set out in Article 73 of the CES."

On the facts of the present case it is hardly conceivable that there were no free places in any of the many colonies situated closer to Moscow, and that the only two colonies which had free space were located several thousand kilometres away from the applicants’ home. Data referred to by the applicants and not contested by the Government suggested that at the time when the applicants were sent to Siberia and the Far North there were free places in the Russian penitentiary system, including in colonies situated in Central Russia (see paragraphs 328 and 347 above). Over thirty-five regions in Russia are closer to Moscow than the Yamalo-Nenetskiy region, and over fifty-five regions are closer than the Chita region. Therefore, it was likely that the FSIN plan did not adhere strictly to the “geographical rule” fixed in Article 73. This may not have led to a breach of the “geographical rule” in all cases, but it is very likely that that rule was not followed in the applicants’ case."

The Court is also mindful of the situation in Russia, where, historically, penal colonies were built in remote and deserted areas, far away from the densely populated regions of Central Russia. There are other arguments speaking in favour of giving the authorities a large margin of appreciation in this sphere. However, that margin of appreciation is not unlimited. The distribution of the prison population must not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies, such as FSIN. The interests of the convicts in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account. The Russian law is based on a similar assumption, as the spirit and the goal of Article 73 of the CES was to preserve the applicants’ social and family ties to the place where they used to live before the conviction. However, practical implementation of that law in Russia could lead to a disproportionate result, as the applicants’ case demonstrates. In absence of a clear and foreseeable method of distribution of convicts amongst penal colonies, the system failed to “provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities” (see Telegraaf Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, § 90, 22 November 2012).

Italy [GC] (no. 44759/98, ECHR 2001-VII), the Government submitted that “tax matters still form part of the hard core of public-authority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant” (§ 29)."

In such circumstances the amounts recovered from him must be regarded as compensation due to society and the State for the wrongs committed by him. The first applicant was therefore deprived of his possessions in the public interest, which prevails in this context over his private interest.

Article 110 of the Tax Code provides that the mens rea of the corporate taxpayer is defined with reference to the mens rea of the managers who acted on its behalf. As a general rule, tax claims concerning unpaid corporate taxes are brought against the corporate taxpayer. However, there are a few exceptions from this rule. Thus, if at the moment when the claim is introduced, the corporate entity still exists but it does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the claim, this triggers the subsidiary liability of the person who was responsible for the tax debt.

Thus in the I. and K. case the Russian Supreme Court stated that there was no legal justification for upholding a civil claim filed by the tax authorities for the evasion of taxes that were not paid by a joint-stock company implicated in a criminal case to the private individuals convicted in the relevant case. The principles set out in I. and K. were applied by the Moscow Regional Court on 9 October 2002 in its report “On the results of an examination of criminal cases in the economic sphere by the Moscow region courts during 2000 and the first half of 2002”:",

In a criminal case an individual may be recognised as a civil respondent only on the basis of the tax, which he failed to pay into the budget as a taxpayer paying income tax. But as a company’s head or chief accountant, an individual cannot incur tax liability for the company, because the latter, being a separate object of taxation, has its own collection of rights and responsibilities as a taxpayer, particularly as the payer of tax on legal entities or companies, including tax on profit (income), VAT, transactions with securities, tax on profit from stock exchange and insurance operations. Therefore, in this example the company/taxpayer itself must be regarded as the civil respondent in respect of the unpaid taxes and duties. In granting the civil claim submitted by the prosecutor, the court actually shifted the obligation to pay tax arrears to the wrong taxpayer. Granting a civil claim for the collection of tax in a criminal case instigated on the indications specified under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (company tax evasion), from the personal funds of a private individual convicted under this article, has no basis in law”."

The amounts recovered from him by virtue of the judgment of 16 May 2005 were the same as the amounts recovered from the companies affiliated with the first applicant - in particular, Yukos. The Meshchanskiy District Court ordered the first applicant to pay the Federal Tax Service RUB 17,395,449,282 in relation to the latter’s claim for damages arising from the alleged non-payment of taxes by the ZATO trading companies. The total award for damages related to the crime committed under Article 199 of the Criminal Code comprised: (a) damages related to the tax evasion for 1999 in the amount of RUB 5,447,501,388; and (b) damages relating to the alleged tax evasion for 2000 in the amount of RUB 11,947,947,894. On appeal, the Moscow City Court excluded from the total amount of unpaid taxes for 1999 and 2000 the amount of taxes which were paid by the four trading companies in promissory notes. The basis of the Moscow City Court’s decision on this point was that even if one assumed that payment of tax by the Lesnoy companies by using promissory notes had been unlawful in 1999 and 2000, by the time that the first applicant’s case came to trial the wording of Article 199 of the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of his being convicted under that (or any other) provision of the Criminal Code in respect of such conduct, and the applicant was therefore entitled to invoke the benefit of that change. As a result, the total amount of unpaid taxes was reduced by the Moscow City Court to RUB 1,217,622,799 for 1999 and to RUB 1,566,046,683 for 2000.

In the case of Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands (23 February 1995, § 59, Series A no. 306 ‑ B), the Court stated that “the importance which the drafters of the Convention attached to this aspect of the second paragraph of Article 1 may be gauged from the fact that at a stage when the proposed text did not contain such explicit reference to taxes, it was already understood to reserve the States’ power to pass whatever fiscal laws they considered desirable, provided always that measures in this field did not amount to arbitrary confiscation (see Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Rapporteur of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, Second Session of the Consultative Assembly, Sixteenth Sitting (25 August 1950), Collected Edition of the Travaux préparatoires, vol. VI, p. 140, commenting on the text of the proposed Article 10A, ibid., p. 68)”. The power of appreciation of the States parties in such matters is therefore a wide one (see Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH, cited above, § 60; see also Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 69, Series A no. 52; National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII; and M.A. and 34 Others v. Finland (dec.), no. 27793/95, 10 June 2003; see also, mutatis mutandis, Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, § 46, Series A no. 284).",

                "871. The Government claimed, referring to Ferrazzini, cited above, that the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the first applicant cannot be analysed in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since it was not an “interference” with the applicant’s rights guaranteed by this provision. The Court considers, however, that the Government’s reading of Ferrazzini is misconceived. The question for the Court in the present case is not to define whether the “tax proceedings” are “civil proceedings” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, but to define whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to the court order recovering a certain amount of unpaid taxes from a taxpayer. Even if tax proceedings are not civil (cf. Yukos judgment, §§ 527 and 528), a pecuniary award made against a taxpayer within such proceedings may still constitute an “interference” with his possessions. As the Court held in Burden, cited above, “taxation is in principle an interference with the right guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since it deprives the person concerned of a possession, namely the amount of money which must be paid” (§ 59). The fact that the State enjoys a large margin of appreciation in this sphere does not affect that conclusion."

                "872. The Government further argued that the amount of unpaid taxes did not constitute the applicant’s “possessions” in the Convention meaning since the applicant withheld it unlawfully. The Court cannot agree with that argument either. The parties disagreed on the meaning of the applicable legal provisions, eligibility of the first applicant and trading companies to tax cuts, and, consequently, on the exact amount of taxes due. Eventually, the courts ruled in favour of the authorities and concluded that Yukos and the first applicant had an outstanding tax debt, but that fact alone cannot remove from the amounts recovered from Yukos and/or from the first applicant the protection guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, “Bulves” AD v. Bulgaria, no. 3991/03, §§ 53-58, 22 January 2009; Intersplav v. Ukraine, no. 803/02, §§ 30-32, 9 January 2007; Shchokin v.

First, he claimed the State had been awarded the same amount of outstanding corporate taxes twice: first, in the tax proceedings before the commercial courts those taxes were recovered from the company, and then, in the criminal proceedings before the Meshchanskiy District Court, the same tax was recovered from the first applicant himself."

Thus, he claimed that, as a matter of principle, Russian law did not provide for the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the managers of that company who had been found guilty of tax evasion under Article 199. In his submissions, only a company which had failed to pay taxes might be a defendant in such circumstances. The interference at issue, therefore, did not have a lawful basis. The Government, on the contrary, argued that the law provided for by the subsidiary liability of managers if the corporate taxpayer had no assets."

The Court reiterates that when speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the same concept to be found elsewhere in the Convention (see Špaček, s.r.o. v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 54, 9 November 1999). The phrase “subject to the conditions provided for by law” requires in the first place the existence of and compliance with adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (see the Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1986, § 110, Series A no. 102). The Court’s power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, inter alia, the Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 18 February 1991, § 50, Series A no. 192; with reference to the Håkansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 47, Series A no. 171). However, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court’s case-law (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 190 and 191, ECHR 2006 ‑ V)."

Where a limited liability company was used merely as a façade for fraudulent actions by its owners or managers, piercing of the corporate veil may be an appropriate solution for defending the rights of its creditors, including the State. That being said, there should be clear rules allowing the State to do so – otherwise an interference would be arbitrary."

Quite the contrary: if unpaid taxes are claimed with reference to the Civil Code as “damages”, as it was the case, Article 1068 of the Civil Code must apply, which provides that damage caused by an employee of the company while performing his official duty must be compensated by that company (see paragraph 446 above), and not by the employee himself. The Government did not explain how their case accommodated Article 1068 of the Civil Code."

The Court is mindful of the fact that Russian law provides, in certain circumstances, for the civil liability of a company’s executives for the debts accrued by it – see Article 56 of the Civil Code, quoted in paragraph 444 above. However, the Court does not consider that Article 56 was applicable in casu. First, it is questionnable whether the Meshchanskiy District Court had the power to grant the claims of the Tax Service against the applicant while the corporate taxpayer still existed (see paragraph 350 above; see also paragraph 18 above). Second, Article 56 of the Civil Code provides for subsidiary liability of managers of the insolvent company, whereas the judgment of the Meshchanskiy District Court seemed to order the recovery of the outstanding amount of company taxes from both applicants on the solidarity basis with the company. Third, Article 56 of the Civil Code was not relied on by the domestic courts. The Court concludes that neither the Tax Code nor the Civil Code at the time allowed for piercing of the corporate veil in such circumstances."

The Court notes that the underlying rules of civil, tax and criminal liability, applied in the case of I. and K., were the same as in the applicants’ case.

After 2006 the Russian courts repeatedly stated that company taxes cannot be recovered from its managers convicted under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 451 above).

The Meshchanskiy District Court’s conclusions on a civil claim worth over RUB 17 billion (over EUR 500 million at the time) run to a few lines and contained neither any reference to legal norms, nor any comprehensible calculation of damages (see paragraphs 267 and 268 above).

Furthermore, the Court in that case did not consider some of the evidence, namely the witness statement by Mr Kasyanov, the former Prime Minister, and the report of the Russian President’s expert advisory group, which analysed the applicants’ second trial. There was now a clear global consensus, including judgments from the highest courts in Switzerland and Cyprus, that the applicants’ prosecution was politically motivated. Finally, the Court’s approach to Article 18 in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) was inconsistent with the Convention case-law. The travaux préparatoires for Article 18 indicated that the drafters of this provision were concerned to ensure thereby that an individual was protected from the imposition of restrictions arising from a desire of the State to protect itself according “to the political tendency which it represents” and the desire of the State to act “against an opposition which it considers dangerous”."

Such recognition is apparent from the Court’s approach to Article 14, which like Article 18, has no autonomous place in the Convention but has a particular character in the case-law (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 57325/00, § 186, 13 November 2007).

On the other hand, the Court cannot agree with the applicants’ sweeping claim that their whole case was a travesty of justice. In the final reckoning, none of the accusations against them concerned their political activities stricto sensu, even remotely. The applicants were not opposition leaders or public officials. The acts imputed to them were not related to their participation in the political life, real or imaginary – they were prosecuted for common criminal offences, such as tax evasion, fraud, etc."

The Court is prepared to admit that some political groups or government officials had their own reasons to push for the applicants’ prosecution. However, it is insufficient to conclude that the applicants would not have been convicted otherwise. Elements of “improper motivation” which may exist in the present case do not make the applicants’ prosecution illegitimate “from the beginning to the end”: the fact remains that the accusations against the applicants were serious, that the case against them had a “healthy core”, and that even if there was a mixed intent behind their prosecution, this did not grant them immunity from answering the accusations. Having said that, the Court observes that the present case, which concerned the events of 2003-2005, does not cover everything which has happened to the applicants ever since, in particular their second trial."

As to the episode of 22 July 2005, when Ms Mikhaylova had been denied access to the applicant, the Government asserted that the applicant had misled the Court about her status – she had not been his advocate and had not therefore been entitled to visit him in the remand prison. Article 53 of the CCrP provided that an advocate must be formally admitted to act in the proceedings by the official in charge of the case. Although Ms Mikhaylova had the status of an advocate, she was not on the list of lawyers admitted to participate in that particular criminal case. As a result, she was not allowed to see the applicant in the capacity of his advocate. She could have visited him in her private capacity, but she failed to obtain written permission for such a visit from the investigator. The Russian law distinguishes between the notions of “defence counsel” ( защитник ) and “advocate” ( адвокат, i.e. a barrister). In order to become a “defence counsel” the advocate must have been admitted to participate in the case in this capacity. Ms Mikhaylova was an “advocate”, but she had not obtained authorisation to participate in the case as the applicant’s “counsel”. The same concerned the episode of 27 July 2005, when Ms Mikhaylova and Mr Prokhorov were denied access to the applicant by the remand prison administration.

Neither had they been able to see their client. The Government had not commented on the authorities’ attempts to disbar the first applicant’s lawyers. Both of his Russian representatives in the Strasbourg proceedings had faced disbarment proceedings: thus, in September 2005, immediately after the appeal hearing, the GPO sought the disbarment of Ms Moskalenko; in March 2007 disbarment proceedings were again instigated against Ms Moskalenko.

In a judgment dated 2 March 2006 the Supreme Court stated that the rule was invalid. The Government accepted that prior to the Supreme Court decision access to the first applicant’s lawyers had been refused during working hours, but offered no explanation as to why such an unlawful restriction on access had not hindered his right of access to this Court."

The first applicant also referred to the words of the President of the Moscow Bar Association who had commented that, to date, the Federal Registration Service had been mainly concerned with requests to deprive the first applicant’s lawyers of the right to practice.

Judging by the number of documents collected and submitted by his legal team it is difficult to imagine that the first applicant’s lawyers were seriously hindered in preparation of the case file for submission to the Court. Thus, the “end result” speaks in favour of the Government’s assertion. However, the Court reiterates that Article 34 may be invoked even if an applicant was able to submit an application, observations, etc. Violations of that provision have been found in many cases where an applicant was successful and the Court found one or several violations of his or her “substantive” rights under the Convention. Thus, the “end-result argument” by itself does not mean that an applicant’s right of individual petition under Article 34 was respected."

He referred in particular to the episodes involving his lawyers Ms Mikhaylova and Mr Prokhorov, who had been denied access to him for some time.

The Court observes that the prosecution made several attempts to disbar his lawyers, including those acting on his behalf in Strasbourg (see paragraph 355 above). Moreover, they were subjected to administrative and financial checks (see paragraph 357 above).

Furthermore, some of those proceedings took place after the first applicant had submitted the application form. An extraordinary tax audit of the NGO headed by Ms Moskalenko (one of the leading lawyers in his Strasbourg team) could also be explained by reasons not connected to the Yukos case.

Although the Court found several violations of the second applicant’s rights under Articles 3, 6 and 8 in the present case, the loss of his earnings can be attributed to many other factors, primarily to the tax proceedings involving Yukos, which eventually led to its bankruptcy and liquidation. The second applicant’s detention throughout 2004 and 2005 undoubtedly played some part in those proceedings. However, the Court does not need to speculate in this respect.

A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts-martial sentencing decisions, particularly where the Judge Advocate General has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here. The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency, the need for deterrence, the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay, which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere. Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when the Courts-Martial Appeal Court is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere, and would justify caution in interfering with courts-martial sentences; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere.”",

There were, however, a large number of points in issue in Morris v. the United Kingdom, and it seems clear that on this particular aspect the European Court did not receive all the help which was needed to form a conclusion. It is true that the junior officers who sit on courts-martial have very little legal training, but that is also true of the [permanent president] whose presence was accepted [in Morris ] as a guarantee of the rights of the accused. It is also true that junior officers sitting on courts-martial remain subject to army discipline and reports. But there is nothing to suggest that any report ever is or ever has been made on any junior officer's decision-making as a member of a court-martial, and it is hard to see how any such report could be made given the prohibition on disclosure of the deliberations of the tribunal in the oath taken by the members. There is nothing to suggest that they remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision-making, and again it is hard to see how they could. It is true that there is no statutory bar on an officer being made subject to external army influence when sitting on the case. Any person seeking to influence the decision of a sitting member of a court-martial otherwise than at the hearing would, however, be at risk of prosecution either for perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice or under section 69 of the 1955 Act. The officer members are drawn from a different command from the accused. Briefing notes sent to officer members of courts-martial before they sit enjoin them not to'speak to any unit personnel and certainly not to any unit officer who may be attending the trial in an official capacity or as a spectator'. They are instructed in writing not to talk to anyone about the case (other than the other members of the court-martial, when all are together) for as long as the trial continues, and this instruction is routinely emphasised by the judge advocate. The officers do not occupy accommodation at the unit of the accused and are told to be seen to avoid'local unit influences'. They are instructed'not to associate with Formation or Unit personnel either professionally or socially until the trial is over'. At the outset of the hearing the officers take an oath in terms quoted by the European Court in [ paragraph 27 of its judgment in Morris ], swearing to try the accused'according to the evidence'and to'administer justice according to the Army Act 1955 without partiality, favour or affection'. In considering the independence and impartiality of the [permanent president] both the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court in the appellants'cases] and the European Court in Morris ... attached weight to established convention and practice. In my opinion the rules governing the role of junior officers as members of courts-martial are in practice such as effectively to protect the accused against the risk that they might be subject to'external army influence', as I feel sure the European Court would have appreciated had the position been more fully explained.”"

                "“Its role can certainly be seen as anomalous, since ordinarily a binding decision of any court cannot be disturbed otherwise than (exceptionally) by itself or by a superior appellate court. It is however to be noted that the review of conviction and sentence carried out by the reviewing authority, whether the accused seeks such review or not ... cannot work otherwise than to the advantage of the accused. The reviewing authority cannot substitute conviction of a more serious offence, nor can it substitute a sentence which is in its opinion more severe (section 113AA(4)). This subsection does not confer a discretion, but calls for an exercise of judgment. It is essentially the same exercise of judgment as is required of the Court of Appeal ... which has not given rise to difficulty in practice. If the reviewing authority were to substitute a sentence which the accused considered to be more severe than that imposed by the court-martial, it would be open to the accused to challenge the substituted sentence on appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and it is important to note that the intervention of the reviewing authority in no way diminishes the rights of the accused on appeal. It is difficult to see any analogy with the situation which the European Court considered in Brumarescu v. Romania ... where the applicant, with a final and irreversible judgment of a court in his favour, was deprived of the benefit of that judgment by a later decision in proceedings initiated by a party not involved in the earlier case. If a court-martial is not an independent and impartial tribunal for the trial of civil offences committed by service personnel in England and Wales, the reviewing authority could not be relied on to save it. But if it is, I find it difficult to understand how the role of the reviewing authority can undermine or reduce its independence and impartiality. [The appellants] recognised the difficulty of this argument and did not seek to sustain the judgment of the European Court on the point.”"

I would also accept that officers serving on courts-martial will disapprove of those found to have acted in breach of the law governing their respective service. But judges and jurors in the Crown Court will similarly disapprove of those found to have infringed the ordinary criminal law. There is no reason to think that in the former case any more than in the latter such disapproval will infect the tribunal's approach to deciding whether the particular accused has broken the law in the manner charged. Officers will appreciate, better than anyone, that to convict and punish those not shown to be guilty is not to promote the interests of good discipline and high morale but to sow the seeds of disaffection and perhaps even mutiny. In the absence of any evidence at all to support it, I could not accept the suggestion that any modern officer would, despite the oath he has taken, exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so.”",

As the European Court noted in Morris ... the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked. In the present cases, in substance, the court-martial must be guarded from the risk of influence by the prosecution and guarded from the risk of influence by the relevant service authorities, especially superior officers who might wish to secure some particular result, supposedly in the interests of the morale or discipline of the service or of some particular unit. As a result of the abolition of the role of the convening officer by the 1996 Act, no issue was raised in these cases as to the independence of the members of the tribunal from the prosecution. On the other hand, Article 6 does not require that the members of the tribunal should not share the values of the military community to which they belong any more than it requires that the judge or members of the jury in a civil court should be divorced from the values of the wider community of which they form part. What matters is that, while sharing the values of the service community, the members of the court-martial should put aside any prejudices which they may have and act – and be seen to act – independently and impartially in deciding the issues in the case before them.”"

However, he went on to observe that such reports generally, and the ones completed in the case before him, commented on the manner in which the permanent president had tackled his role as a permanent president (referring to the administrative aspects of the job) and did not bear on his actual decisions when sitting in a court-martial. Indeed, Lord Rodger noted that the reports in question had recognised that the permanent president's role was one in which the president was “isolated and unsupervised and which require [d] independence” which the Air Secretary “honour[ed] and respect[ed]”.

He drew parallels between the members of the court-martial and jurors, noting that, while jurors brought certain prejudices and experiences with them to a trial, the safeguards of an oath and the trial judge's directions were considered by the domestic courts and by the European Court to be sufficient to ensure that jurors put aside their prejudices and reached a just verdict on the evidence. The members of courts-martial took a similar oath and the judge advocate gave them the same kind of directions which a trial judge would have given jurors: there was no reason to suppose that members of a court-martial would be less faithful to their oath or less diligent in applying the directions given by the judge advocate than would jurors, particularly when “trust and obedience to commands” were important to the officers sitting on a court-martial."

Those steps had not, he noted, been outlined to the Chamber in Morris. He went on to detail those steps. In this connection, he referred to the briefing notes sent to members of the court-martial and noted as relevant safeguards those matters outlined at paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 20, 21, 25, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42 and 45 of those notes.

                "“The various provisions which I have quoted from the briefing notes for the members of courts-martial reinforce significantly the message, proclaimed in any event by the oath and the directions of the judge advocate, that the members are to act independently and impartially. In order to be seen to avoid local unit influences, the members are not to stay in public accommodation at the accused's unit. They are not to speak to unit personnel and especially not to any officer who may be attending the trial – at the risk of being debarred from the trial or indeed of the trial being prejudiced. They are not to associate either professionally or socially with such personnel until the trial is over. There is a veto on the president briefing the other members of the court in the absence of the judge advocate. The members are to tell the court administration officer if they know something about the accused which could prejudice their impartiality or if they know someone who might be a witness in the case. The members are warned not to talk to anyone else about the case as long as it continues. They are not to look at any papers which are before the judge advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel, for fear of seeing something which they ought not to. When they deliberate on conviction or sentence, the most junior member is to give his opinion orally first – again, obviously, with the aim of ensuring that the junior members express their own personal view, uninfluenced by the more senior members. In terms of the members'oath their deliberations are to be kept secret and this secrecy is further ensured by the instruction to the court orderly at the end of the proceedings to burn or shred all scrap paper. Again, the object is to prevent the members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial by reason of their participation in the decision in the case.",

But if they are indeed observed, I find it hard, if not impossible, to see how anyone either in the court or, more particularly, outside the court could improperly influence the members'decision either on conviction or on sentence. Certainly, it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure that, while sitting in the court-martial, the officers act not as officers subject to command but as independent and impartial members of the court, reaching the verdict and determining the sentence according to law but according also to their own individual conscience.”"

                "“First, the routines, the periods of boredom and the pleasures, pains and pressures of service life would be unknown to most jurors today, although they would have been familiar to many of their fathers and grandfathers. By contrast, members of a court-martial know all about them and about the society in which the accused lives and works. [The appellants'counsel ] suggested that officers on a court-martial, imbued by their training with notions of rank and discipline, would always tend to believe the evidence of a fellow officer or a non-commissioned officer rather than the evidence of a private. By contrast, he said, members of a jury, who carried no such burden of preconceptions, would be able to see more clearly and judge purely on the evidence before them. Of course, this submission was really just a matter of assertion. There was, and could be, no evidence to back it up. Indeed, it was somewhat undermined by the conviction of [ two of] the appellants ... [Those appellants'] conviction was based on the evidence of [two Guardsmen] ... In accepting the guardsmen's evidence, the court-martial must have disbelieved the evidence of their superiors in rank ... In any event, it is possible to fashion an argument – equally a matter of assertion – that officers who are familiar with service life and who are in close contact with service personnel of all ranks may well be less impressed by mere rank and better able to gauge the underlying realities than jurors confronted for the first time with officers or non-commissioned officers telling an apparently plausible tale. Viewed in this light, the specialised knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial could be seen as a positive advantage rather than as a disadvantage. However that may be, I see no reason to think that, when duly directed by the judge advocate, officers on a court-martial cannot properly assess the evidence and return a true verdict based on it. I therefore reject the appellants'argument on this point.",
                "The members of a court-martial perform a role in deciding sentence which is no part of a jury's function in the United Kingdom. I accept that, in determining sentence, the members will indeed have regard to such issues as the impact of the offence on service morale and discipline. They will, inevitably, be more aware of these effects than a civil judge would be. Therefore, while the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of the members should mean that they approach their verdict in much the same way as jurors in a civil trial, it cannot be assumed that, when passing sentence, the court-martial will necessarily give exactly the same weight to these service factors as would a Crown Court judge. The sentences which a court-martial passes may therefore not coincide exactly with the sentences which a civil judge would pass on the same facts. In my view that does not call the decisions of the courts-martial into question, either generally or in terms of Article 6. Any difference in sentencing does not mean that the members are not independent or impartial, but merely that, though both independent and impartial, they may assess the various factors differently ... There are ... two additional points to bear in mind. The first is that the judge advocate advises the other members on sentence and also has a vote on sentence. He will be able to bring to bear his informed view as a lawyer on what sentence would be suitable. The second safeguard is that any sentence imposed by the court-martial is subject not only to review by the reviewing authority but also to appeal, on the ground that it is not appropriate, with the leave of the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ]. The members of the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] are civil judges and are in a position to correct any inappropriate punishment that the court-martial may impose by reason of the members'military background.”"

Lord Rodger considered that all of these matters had to be borne in mind when considering the particular characteristics of the members of the court-martial to which the Chamber attached importance in Morris. He went on to identify and disagree with the specific concerns expressed by the Chamber in that case as regards the independence of the ordinary members:",
                "“The first was that the officer members had no legal training. That applies also in the present cases and indeed must apply in virtually all cases. As the briefing notes show, officers who may be called upon to sit on courts-martial are given some training by being allowed to sit and observe proceedings, including the members'deliberations. This should mean that, when they are eventually asked to sit, they should not find the procedures wholly unknown or strange, but it goes no further than that. While in Morris v. the United Kingdom the Third Chamber seems to have regarded the lack of formal legal training as a significant defect, as I have already noted, in Engel v. the Netherlands ... the European Court held that the Dutch Supreme Military Court was an independent and impartial tribunal, even though four of the six members were military officers with no legal training. Given the other safeguards which were in place in the present cases, I see no reason to conclude that the absence of legal training undermined the members'independence and impartiality.",
                "The European Court attached importance to the fact that the officers, other than the permanent president, remained subject to army discipline and reports. In so far as the members of the courts-martial in the present cases also remained subject to service discipline, they simply shared the characteristic of all serving members of the armed forces. It must have been equally true of the military members of the Dutch Supreme Military Court in Engel v. the Netherlands. Moreover, the fuller information available to the House about the safeguards in place to protect the independence of the members of courts-martial shows clearly, in my view, that, just like the Dutch officers in Engel v. the Netherlands, the officers in these cases would not have been under the command of any higher authority in their function as members of the courts-martial. Indeed, as [the Ministry of Defence] pointed out, contrary to the assumption of the European Court, there was even a formal legal bar to any superior officer trying to influence their decision, since this would have constituted the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice.",
                "It is true, of course, that, as in Morris v. United Kingdom, so also in these cases, leaving aside the permanent presidents, the officers sitting on the courts-martial would have remained subject to reports. [The appellants] indeed drew attention to a number of such reports where mention is made of the fact that, during the year in question, the officer concerned had sat as a member of a court-martial. In itself that must be unobjectionable since the information that the particular officer has had this experience may be relevant at some future date if, for instance, consideration is being given to appointing a permanent president. What would be objectionable would be any report which made reference, whether favourable or unfavourable, to an officer's decisions when sitting on a court-martial. But [the appellants] could point to no report where this had been done. The only report which referred to an officer's performance in relation to a court-martial was one relating to [one officer]:'Her foray into the court-martial arena has brought particular accolades for her thoughtful and incisive contribution to the legal process'. The report showed that [that officer] had acted not only as junior member on several courts-martial but also as assistant defending officer to an airman tried by a general court-martial. It appears that the comment may well have related to this second role. In any event the report makes no comment on any decision reached by [that officer] when sitting as a member of a court-martial. Indeed counsel for the [Ministry of Defence] showed the House a number of statements from officers concerned with personnel matters who had read thousands of annual reports and had never seen mention of such a thing. That being so, again with the benefit of this more detailed information, I would not share the view of the European Court in Morris v. the United Kingdom that the independence and impartiality of officers sitting on courts-martial are compromised by the fact that they remain subject to the system of annual reports.",
                "For all these reasons I consider that those charged with administering the system of courts-martial have been at pains to put in place a series of practical safeguards which are designed to secure the independence and impartiality of those sitting on these courts. Nor is this surprising. There is not a little force in the point made by the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] that, if service factors are to be seen as an aspect or function of the public interest, they will themselves require that the court-martial process should be, and should be seen to be, fair and impartial and, so far as possible, to achieve accurate results. Otherwise both servicemen and the public would lose confidence in it, with consequential effects on good order and discipline.",
                "Having regard in particular to the additional information which was not before the European Court, I would therefore hold that the safeguards built into the system are indeed such that no fair-minded and informed observer who had considered them would conclude that there was a real possibility that the courts-martial in these cases lacked independence or impartiality in this respect. In other words they were, objectively, independent and impartial. I would accordingly reject the Article 6 challenge based on the role of the officer members.”"

It does not operate like an ordinary court and, at a certain level of abstract theory, its existence could seem to be inconsistent with the charge against an accused being determined by only a system of'tribunals'. That appears to be the way in which the European Court has treated it. But if, as the court indicates, the issue can also be characterised as relating to the independence of the court-martial, I find it difficult to see how the existence of this body affects that independence. It might, of course, be different if there were any suggestion that the decisions of the courts-martial were influenced by the existence of the reviewing authority, for example, because they tended to convict more readily or to impose heavier sentences in the knowledge that the reviewing authority could always quash them. But [the appellants] made no such submission and there is nothing whatever in the information before the House that would support it. On the contrary, [the appellants] accepted that the provision for review could only be to the benefit, and not to the detriment, of someone who had been convicted. In particular, it could provide a quick and simple means of correcting a mistaken decision by a court-martial.",
                "In reaching its conclusion on this point the European Court was particularly concerned by the fact that the decision as to whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court-martial would have been left to the discretion of the reviewing authority. When making this observation the Court does not appear to have been referred to, or to have had in mind, the coda to section 71(1) of the [1955 Act] which establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of particular punishments in the hierarchy of punishments set out in the subsection and which deals specifically with how detention and imprisonment are to relate to one another. Particularly when these provisions are taken into account, it is hard to see how, in reality, there is likely to be any scope for the reviewing authority to exercise the kind of discretion that appears to have troubled the European Court. In truth, counsel could refer to no case where any problem as to the relative severity of two punishments had arisen. If, by chance, however, the reviewing authority were to go wrong on the point, the person affected could ask the appeal court for leave to appeal.",

Where they had other arguable grounds of appeal relating to conviction or sentence, the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] dealt with them, as well as with the Article 6 grounds, in their reasoned judgments. In these circumstances I am, with due respect to the decision of the European Court in Morris v .the United Kingdom, unable to see why the mere existence of the reviewing authority, or the reduction of [a] period of detention [in one case], should lead to the conclusion that the determination of the charges against the appellants was not reached by a'tribunal'that was'independent and impartial'for the purposes of Article 6. I would therefore reject the appellants'Article 6 argument based on the role of the reviewing authority.”"

In any event, four of the six officers sitting in the court-martial in Engel and Others, cited above, had no legal training. Moreover, drawing a parallel between jurors and the ordinary members of courts-martial (all without legal training and guided by binding rulings on points of law from the trial judge and judge advocate respectively), the Government pointed out that this Court had never suggested that the determination of guilt by lay jurors was incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Furthermore, armed with the Courts-Martial Administrative Unit (RAF) briefing notes and the instructions of the judge advocate, the ordinary members would have had a very clear idea of their role and duties at the court-martial.",
                "Secondly, it was true that members of the court-martial remained subject to air-force discipline in the general sense because they remained air-force officers. However, members of courts-martial did not remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision-making, so that any reporting by the service authorities on them had to, and did in the applicant's case, exclude any comment on the carrying out by them of their duties as members of a court-martial. This was the position in Morris, and the Government regretted that this information had not been before the Court when it examined that case. Accordingly, the fact that ordinary members remained subject to air-force discipline did not undermine their independence ( the Government referred to Engel and Others, cited above, pp. 12-13, § 30).",
                "Thirdly, in the Government's opinion, there were clearly sufficient safeguards of the independence of the decision-making of the ordinary members of courts-martial. Perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice was a common - law criminal offence and an offence under section 69 of the 1955 Act. The deliberations during which the members of the court-martial voted were confidential. Each member took an oath. As with civilian jurors, there was a reasonable expectation that the ordinary members would comply with the binding directions given by the judge advocate to try the case and give a true verdict according to the evidence and without prejudice ( see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ III, and Gregory v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997 - I). The Government emphasised the content, and distribution to each court-martial member, of the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (RAF) briefing notes. The Government could not locate the actual briefing notes applicable at the time of the applicant's court-martial but submitted those in force in July 1999, which they stated made only minor changes to those notes in force in February 1998. According to the Government, the notes reinforced the message, proclaimed in the oath, that members were at all times to act independently and impartially and they had the effect of preventing members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial.

Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998 - IV, pp. 1572-73, § 71).",

The Court notes that the present applicant did not suggest that anyone involved in his court-martial process was subjectively biased against him.",

In Findlay, the Court concluded that the applicant's misgivings about the independence and impartiality of his army court-martial, convened prior to the entry into force of the 1996 Act, had been objectively justified. The Court was mainly concerned about the conflicting roles of the “convening officer” in the proceedings: he had a key prosecuting role, but at the same time appointed the members of the court-martial who were subordinate in rank to him and fell within his chain of command. He also had the power to dissolve the court-martial before or during the trial and acted as “confirming officer” after the trial, so that a court-martial's verdict and sentence were not effective until “confirmed” by that officer."

                "The Court found that service tribunals could in principle determine criminal charges against service personnel consistently with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, although such tribunals would only be tolerated as long as sufficient safeguards were in place to guarantee their independence and impartiality ( see Morris, § 59 ). It was also found that the 1996 Act had gone a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed in Findlay, abolishing as it did the posts of “convening officer” and “confirming officer” and separating the prosecution, convening and adjudication elements of the court-martial process ( ibid., § § 61 and 62). The Court further found that the independence of the court-martial was not undermined by the manner of appointment of its members ( ibid., § 66).",
                "However, and while considering the permanent president to be a “significant guarantee of independence” and the presence of the judge advocate to be an “important guarantee”, these and other safeguards (rules on eligibility for selection and the oath taken by members) were considered insufficient by the Court to exclude the risk of outside pressure being brought to bear on the ordinary officer members ( see Morris, §§ 69-72). Further, the Court found that the principle that a tribunal's binding decision should be unalterable by a non-judicial authority had been breached by the role of the reviewing authority, a principle which had been considered in Findlay (cited above) to be a component of the “independence” guarantee of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

While the higher authority decides on the basis of service considerations whether a charge should be brought before the prosecuting authority, it is the prosecuting authority which decides whether a prosecution by court-martial should be pursued or not. The 1996 Act has not conferred on the higher authority, and there is no evidence that the higher authority fulfils, any other role in the pursuit of charges by court-martial. Since the decision to prosecute by court-martial is one exclusively for the prosecuting authority, it is not relevant to the independence of the court-martial process whether the higher authority is legally qualified or not or whether there is a chain - of - command connection between that authority and the CO. The applicant's suggestion that the higher authority is the equivalent of the former “convening officer ” is clearly incorrect."

The decision to prosecute is made on the basis of legal criteria similar to those applied by the Crown Prosecution Service and in accordance with the codes of conduct of the respective branches of the legal profession. While the prosecuting authority is also the RAF Director of Legal Services, he is answerable to the Attorney General only, and is not reported on within the service on his prosecution duties. There being no chain of command or service connection between the higher and prosecuting authorities either claimed or apparent, any seniority in rank of the higher authority over the prosecuting authority would not be sufficient to conclude, as the applicant suggests, that the latter is “likely to” be influenced by the former."

However, the applicant did not dispute that a CAO operates independently of the higher and prosecuting authorities, a conclusion also reached in Morris (§§ 61 and 66). Moreover, the CAO's duties are largely administrative in nature, requiring the CAO to take steps which have been regulated in some detail in the 1955 Act, the 1997 Rules and the Queen's Regulations to ensure that a court-martial hearing takes place with the necessary persons in attendance and with the required facilities in place. As to the more significant and sensitive task of selecting members of a court-martial, the detailed criteria and procedures to be followed by a CAO (see paragraphs 34-35 above) allow that officer little discretion in that selection and rebut the applicant's claim that the selection process lacks transparency. In addition, these criteria expressly exclude from a court-martial any officer from the accused's RAF station and any of his COs, as well as any officer who has been involved in the investigation and prosecution of the charges or in the convening of a court-martial. Furthermore, all officers selected to sit are reminded in the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (RAF) briefing notes received by them (see paragraphs 45 -6 2 above) of these and any other factors that could render them ineligible, and members are encouraged to inform the CAO prior to the trial (or the judge advocate once the trial has started ) if they are worried that they may be ineligible."

The independence of air-force judge advocates is not questioned by the applicant, and the Court considers that there is no ground to do so.",
                "Moreover, a judge advocate has a central role in the court-martial proceedings which, like Lord Rodger in R. v. Boyd and Others, the Grand Chamber would compare to that of a Crown Court trial judge. The judge advocate is responsible for the fair and lawful conduct of the court-martial and his rulings on the course of the evidence and on all questions of law are binding and must be given in open court. The judge advocate has no vote on verdict and does not therefore retire with the other court-martial members to deliberate on verdict. However, he sums up the evidence and delivers further directions to the other members of the court-martial beforehand, and he can refuse to accept a verdict if he considers it “contrary to law”, in which case he gives the president and ordinary members further directions in open court, following which those members retire again to consider verdict. The judge advocate retires with the other members in order to provide advice, deliberate and vote on sentence. Moreover, and as Lord Rodger also noted (see paragraph 72 above), there is no evidence to suggest that members (the permanent president and the ordinary members) of a court-martial would be less diligent than civilian jurors in complying with binding rulings and directions on points of law given to them.",
                "In such circumstances, the Court finds that the presence in a court-martial of a civilian with such qualifications and with such a pivotal role in the proceedings constitutes not only an important safeguard but one of the most significant guarantees of the independence of the court-martial proceedings."

                "Most importantly, the Court observes that, while the permanent president is a serving officer, the post was a full-time one filled by a high - ranking officer ( wing commander) for a number of years prior to his retirement, at a time when that officer had “no effective hope of promotion” ( in the words of Lord Bingham – see paragraph 66 above). Such factors were considered demonstrative of the independence of the military members of the court-martial in Engel and Others ( cited above, pp.12-13, § 30 and p.37, § 89).",
                "The Court does not accept the applicant's suggestion that the full-time nature of the post of permanent president would undermine the objectivity of that officer's judgment (see paragraph 8 8 above). Since the permanent president was bound by the legal rulings and directions of the judge advocate, the permanent president's lack of legal qualifications did not undermine his independence or the guarantee of independence provided by that post. While he may have been more senior in rank to the ordinary members, he could not brief them in the absence of the judge advocate and, although he deliberated on verdict alone with the ordinary members, the judge advocate exercised firm control over those deliberations both before and after they took place (see paragraphs 29 and 11 7 above).",
                "It is true that, in contrast to the army, appraisal reports were prepared on permanent presidents in the RAF and the Court would echo the concerns expressed by Lords Bingham and Rodger in this regard. However, the essential point for present purposes is that no appraisal report had been drawn up on the present permanent president since August 1997 and, crucially, such reports could not have referred to that officer's judicial decision-making. As Lord Bingham pointed out (see paragraph 66 above), permanent presidents were answerable to no one in the discharge of their court-martial functions.",
                "It is also true that there was no express provision for their irremovability and that express security of tenure would be preferable, as such a domestic provision is generally considered to be a corollary of judges'independence. However, its absence can be cured if irremovability is recognised in fact and if other necessary guarantees are present ( see Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, p. 40, § 80, and Morris, cited above, § 68).

However, in the absence of any precise and substantiated challenge to this assertion, the Court does not see any reason to doubt that the notes submitted to it in the present case were similar in all material respects to those actually distributed to members of the applicant's court-martial in February 1998. Moreover, the Court considers these notes to be genuine instructions to the members of courts-martial by which they were expected to abide.",
                "The notes provided a detailed step-by-step guide to the ordinary members of the procedures before a court-martial. They also constituted a comprehensive manual of the nature and limits of their role in those proceedings and, importantly, of the precise functions of the judge advocate and permanent president. The Court considers that the briefing notes thereby provided essential information and important orientation to officers who were appointed on an ad hoc basis to a court-martial and who had no legal qualifications and relatively little court-martial experience.",

The hearings of witnesses Jansen and Koene each lasted a good five hours.

Where necessary the statement was then amended, clarified and expanded - always, of course, within the limits of what the witness really wanted to say. And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out, it is my belief that the advocate-general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings. Those present really did have the opportunity for hours on each occasion. If they so desired, those present had several chances to put questions to a witness. Unlike what normally happens at court hearings, everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions.

I have no reason to doubt their reliability. Nor at any time did I have the impression that I was being lied to. On the contrary, each and every one of them was very much to the point. The persons facing me wore serious expressions. The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved. The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ0 3 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused. All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.",

I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable.

Of course it is ultimately for the Court of Appeal to decide on the value of the statements.",

It seems to me that I am now affording the Court an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments. I think that the text of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands also compels me, as the judge conducting the questioning, to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous. I am also concerned to inform the Court of Appeal that I am aware that the Court is called to take the final decision in these matters. I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity.

By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance. At the same time, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses (who are no longer anonymous to myself) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision. It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the ‘ numbered witnesses ’ acted carelessly. Rather, in my opinion, the opposite was true.",

I have been asked to endorse that opinion. I decline to do so. The witness Koene was wary in his answers, which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly. It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred some years previously should not be reproached for failing, in his answers to those questions, to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [the two lawyers] in particular subjected him on 8 November 1990, together and in tandem. Furthermore, I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question, especially if he has already replied under oath on the day before. The witness Koene kept a cool head, and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality. As far as I can judge at the present time, I regard him as a reliable witness. Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness, if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of 7 November and 8 November 1990.",

In my judgment, Mr Engelen is a simple, friendly and very obliging man. Perhaps I can illustrate the impression I had of him by recording that, after the interrogation had gone on for a considerable time, I thought it opportune to ask the unusual question whether the witness could read. I do not exclude the possibility that he is not entirely aware of the great importance of an exact and consistent account of what he saw.",

In these circumstances, the risk run by the witnesses identified only by a number and their families if their anonymity is lifted or insufficiently guaranteed is decisive.

                "“The high incidence of death and injury on the roads caused by the misuse of motor vehicles is a very serious problem common to almost all developed societies. The need to address it in an effective way, for the benefit of the public, cannot be doubted. Among other ways in which democratic societies have sought to address it is by subjecting the use of motor vehicles to a regime of regulation and making provision for enforcement by identifying, prosecuting and punishing offending drivers. Materials ... incomplete though they are, reveal different responses to the problem of enforcement. Under some legal systems (Spain, Belgium and France are examples) the registered owner is presumed to be the driver guilty of minor traffic infractions unless he shows that some other person was driving at the relevant time or establishes some other ground of exoneration. There being a clear public interest in enforcement of road traffic legislation the crucial question in this case is whether section 172 represents a disproportionate response, or one that undermines a defendant’s right to a fair trial, if an admission of being the driver is relied on at trial.",
                "I do not for my part consider that section 172, properly applied, does represent a disproportionate response to this serious social problem, nor do I think that reliance on the respondent’s admission in the present case, would undermine her right to a fair trial. I reach that conclusion for a number of reasons.",
                "1. Section 172 provides for the putting of a single, simple question. The answer cannot of itself incriminate the suspect, since it is not without more an offence to drive a car. An admission of driving may, of course, as here, provide proof of a fact necessary to convict, but the section does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences such as understandably was held to be objectionable in Saunders, and the penalty for declining to answer under the section is moderate and non-custodial. There is in the present case no suggestion of improper coercion or oppression such as might give rise to unreliable admissions and so contribute to a miscarriage of justice, and if there were evidence of such conduct the trial judge would have ample power to exclude evidence of the admission.",
                "2. While the High Court was entitled to distinguish ... between the giving of an answer under section 172 and the provision of physical samples, and had the authority of the European Court in Saunders ... for doing so, this distinction should not in my opinion be pushed too far. It is true that the respondent’s answer whether given orally or in writing would create new evidence which did not exist until she spoke or wrote. In contrast, it may be acknowledged, the percentage of alcohol in her blood was a fact, existing before she blew into the breathalyser machine. But the whole purpose of requiring her to blow into the machine (on pain of a criminal penalty if she refused) was to obtain evidence not available until she did so and the reading so obtained could, in all save exceptional circumstances, be enough to convict a driver of an offence ... [I]t is not easy to see why a requirement to answer a question is objectionable and a requirement to undergo a breath test is not. Yet no criticism is made of the requirement that the respondent undergo a breath test.",
                "3. All who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the State but because the possession and use of cars (like, for example, shotguns ...) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury. It is true that section 172(2)(b) permits a question to be asked of ‘any other person’ who, if not the owner or driver, might not be said to have impliedly accepted the regulatory regime, but someone who was not the owner or driver would not incriminate himself whatever answer he gave. If, viewing this situation in the round, one asks whether section 172 represents a disproportionate legislative response to the problem of maintaining road safety, whether the balance between the interests of the community at large and the interests of the individual is struck in a manner unduly prejudicial to the individual, whether (in short) the leading of this evidence would infringe a basic human right of the respondent, I would feel bound to give negative answers. If the present argument is a good one it has been available to British citizens since 1966, but no one in this country has to my knowledge, criticised the legislation as unfair at any time up to now.”",

In addition to the cases on the right to remain silent (see, for example, Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, § 62, Reports 1996-VI), they referred to the limitations on access to court (see, for example, Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 58, Series A no. 93), to case-law showing that in certain circumstances Contracting States were permitted to reverse the onus of proof of certain matters provided that this did not disturb the fair balance between the interests of the individual and the general interests of the community (see, for example, Salabiaku v.

There were very good reasons why the owner should be required to identify the driver: driving offences are intended to deter dangerous conduct which causes risk to the public and deterrence depended on effective enforcement (research showed that speed cameras, etc., had reduced crashes by up to 28%), there was no obvious generally effective alternative to the power contained in section 172 and without such a power it would be impossible to investigate and prosecute traffic offences effectively, and the simple fact of being the driver of a motor car was not in itself incriminating. Nor did section 172 breach the presumption of innocence as the overall burden of proof remained on the prosecution. It provided for the putting of a single question in particular circumstances and all the usual protections against the use of unreliable evidence or evidence obtained by improper means remained in place, while the maximum penalty was only a fine of GBP 1,000."

They disputed that there was no obvious alternative, asserting that methods of indirect compulsion, or the use of incriminating information obtained compulsorily outside the context of the criminal proceedings themselves, would achieve the same end. They argued that an actual or potential defendant could not be compelled on pain of penalty to provide information which only he was capable of providing and which could not be provided by documents or physical evidence independent of his will.

John Murray v. the United Kingdom (8 February 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ I) concerned, amongst other things, the drawing of inferences from a person’s silence during questioning and trial. The Court found that there was no doubt that “the right to remain silent under police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 ... By providing the accused with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities these immunities contribute to avoiding miscarriages of justice and to securing the aims of Article 6” (see John Murray, cited above, § 45). The Court saw two extremes. On the one hand, it was self-evident that it was incompatible with the immunities to base a conviction solely or mainly on the accused’s silence or on a refusal to answer questions or to give evidence himself. On the other hand, the immunities could and should not prevent the accused’s silence from being taken into account in situations which clearly called for an explanation. The conclusion was that the “right to remain silent” was not absolute (ibid., § 47). In discussing the degree of compulsion in the case, the Court noted that the applicant’s silence did not amount to a criminal offence or contempt of court, and that silence could not, in itself, be regarded as an indication of guilt (ibid., § 48). The Court thus distinguished the case from Funke, where the degree of compulsion had, in effect, “destroyed the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination” (ibid., § 49)."

The domestic provisions required company officers to produce books and documents, to attend before inspectors and to assist inspectors in their investigation on pain of a fine or committal to prison for two years. The Court referred to the cases in John Murray and Funke, and found that the right not to incriminate oneself was primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent. It did not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material which may be obtained from the accused through the use of compulsory powers but which had an existence independent of the will of the suspect, such as breath, blood and urine samples. The Court held that the question whether the use made by the prosecution of the statements obtained from the applicant by the inspectors under compulsion amounted to an unjustifiable infringement of the right “had to be examined in the light of all the circumstances of the case”: in particular, it had to be determined whether the applicant had been subjected to compulsion to give evidence and whether the use made of the resulting testimony offended the basic principles of a fair procedure under Article 6 § 1 (see Saunders, cited above, §§ 67 and 69)."

The Court accepted that it would have been admissible for the applicant to refuse to answer questions from the judge that were likely to steer him in the direction of self-incriminating evidence, but found on the facts that the fine in the case was imposed in order to ensure that statements were truthful, rather than to force the witness to give evidence.

As regards the use of evidence obtained in breach of the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court recalls that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6. Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, Saunders, cited above, § 68; Heaney and McGuinness, cited above, § 40; J.B. v.

In the Court’s view, the evidence in issue in the present case, namely, drugs hidden in the applicant’s body which were obtained by the forcible administration of emetics, could be considered to fall into the category of material having an existence independent of the will of the suspect, the use of which is generally not prohibited in criminal proceedings. However, there are several elements which distinguish the present case from the examples listed in Saunders. Firstly, as with the impugned measures in Funke and J.B. v. Switzerland, the administration of emetics was used to retrieve real evidence in defiance of the applicant’s will. Conversely, the bodily material listed in the Saunders case concerned material obtained by coercion for forensic examination with a view to detecting, for example, the presence of alcohol or drugs.",
                "114. Secondly, the degree of force used in the present case differs significantly from the degree of compulsion normally required to obtain the types of material referred to in the Saunders case. To obtain such material, a defendant is requested to endure passively a minor interference with his physical integrity (for example when blood or hair samples or bodily tissue are taken). Even if the defendant’s active participation is required, it can be seen from Saunders that this concerns material produced by the normal functioning of the body (such as, for example, breath, urine or voice samples). In contrast, compelling the applicant in the instant case to regurgitate the evidence sought required the forcible introduction of a tube through his nose and the administration of a substance so as to provoke a pathological reaction in his body. As noted earlier, this procedure was not without risk to the applicant’s health.",
                "115. Thirdly, the evidence in the present case was obtained by means of a procedure which violated Article 3. The procedure used in the applicant’s case is in striking contrast to procedures for obtaining, for example, a breath test or a blood sample. Procedures of the latter kind do not, unless in exceptional circumstances, attain the minimum level of severity so as to contravene Article 3. Moreover, though constituting an interference with the suspect’s right to respect for private life, these procedures are, in general, justified under Article 8 § 2 as being necessary for the prevention of criminal offences (see, inter alia, Tirado Ortiz and Lozano Martin, cited above).",

In order to determine whether the applicant’s right not to incriminate himself has been violated, the Court will have regard, in turn, to the following factors: the nature and degree of compulsion used to obtain the evidence; the weight of the public interest in the investigation and punishment of the offence in issue; the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedure; and the use to which any material so obtained is put.”"

The applicants contended that the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself are absolute rights and that to apply any form of direct compulsion to require an accused person to make incriminatory statements against his will of itself destroys the very essence of that right. The Court is unable to accept this. It is true, as pointed out by the applicants, that in all the cases to date in which “direct compulsion” was applied to require an actual or potential suspect to provide information which contributed, or might have contributed, to his conviction, the Court has found a violation of the applicant’s privilege against self-incrimination. It does not, however, follow that any direct compulsion will automatically result in a violation. While the right to a fair trial under Article 6 is an unqualified right, what constitutes a fair trial cannot be the subject of a single unvarying rule but must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. This was confirmed in the specific context of the right to remain silent in Heaney and McGuinness and, more recently, in the Court’s judgment in Jalloh, in which the Court identified the factors to which it would have regard in determining whether the applicant’s privilege against self-incrimination had been violated."

The Court accepts that the factual circumstances of Jalloh were very different from the present case. It is nevertheless unpersuaded by the applicants’ argument. Even if a clear distinction could be drawn in every case between the use of compulsion to obtain incriminatory statements on the one hand and “real” evidence of an incriminatory nature on the other, the Court observes that the Jalloh case was not treated as one falling within the “real” evidence exception in Saunders; on the contrary, the Court held that the case was to be treated as one of self-incrimination according to the broader meaning given to that term in Funke and J.B. v.

In the present case, the compulsion was imposed in the context of section 172 of the Road Traffic Act, which imposes a specific duty on the registered keeper of a vehicle to give information about the driver of the vehicle in certain circumstances. The Court notes that, although both the compulsion and the underlying offences were “criminal” in nature, the compulsion flowed from the fact, as Lord Bingham expressed it in the Privy Council in the case of Brown v. Stott (see paragraph 31 above), that “[a]ll who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the State but because the possession and use of cars (like, for example, shotguns ...) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury”. Those who choose to keep and drive motor cars can be taken to have accepted certain responsibilities and obligations as part of the regulatory regime relating to motor vehicles, and in the legal framework of the United Kingdom these responsibilities include the obligation, in the event of suspected commission of road-traffic offences, to inform the authorities of the identity of the driver on that occasion."

Section 172(2)(a) applies only where the driver of the vehicle is alleged to have committed a relevant offence, and authorises the police to require information only “as to the identity of the driver”. The information is thus markedly more restricted than in previous cases, in which applicants have been subjected to statutory powers requiring production of “papers and documents of any kind relating to operations of interest to [the] department” (see Funke, cited above, § 30), or of “documents, etc., which might be relevant for the assessment of taxes” (see J.B. v. Switzerland, cited above, § 39). In Heaney and McGuinness the applicants were required to give a “full account of [their] movements and actions during any specified period” (cited above, § 24), and in Shannon, information could be sought (with only a limited legal professional privilege restriction) on any matter which appeared to the investigator to relate to the investigation (see reference at § 23 of Shannon, cited above). The information requested of the applicant in Weh was limited, as in the present case, to “information as to who had driven a certain motor vehicle ... at a certain time ...” (see Weh, cited above, § 24). The Court found no violation of Article 6 in that case on the ground that no proceedings were pending or anticipated against him. It noted that the requirement to state a simple fact – who had been the driver of the car – was not in itself incriminating (ibid., §§ 53-54). Further, as Lord Bingham noted in Brown v. Stott (paragraph 31 above), section 172 does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences, and the penalty for declining to answer is “moderate and non-custodial”."

At his trial, he attempted to challenge the admission of the statement under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, although the challenge was unsuccessful. It remained for the prosecution to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt in ordinary proceedings, including protection against the use of unreliable evidence and evidence obtained by oppression or other improper means (but not including a challenge to the admissibility of the statement under section 172), and the defendant could give evidence and call witnesses if he wished. Again, as noted in the case of Brown v.

The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, §§ 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1998-IV, p. 1462, § 34). It is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, unlawfully obtained evidence – may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found."

The judge concluded that there was evidence on the tapes from which the jury could infer that the applicant was involved in the events of 3 February 1995, and it was not so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to assess for themselves. The judge also rejected the applicant's counsel's arguments under sections 76 and 78 of PACE that the evidence from H. was obtained by oppression or by such impropriety as to render it inadmissible. He considered that the use of an informant to talk and listen to the accused over a substantial period of time did not result in any unfairness to the accused. The fact that H. might be considered as having much to gain in giving evidence was also a matter to be left to the jury in their assessment of the reliability of his evidence. The evidence was accordingly admitted before the jury. The judge's ruling on the admissibility of the evidence was given on 26 January 1998, after a voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of a jury) and consisted of a judgment of eighteen pages."

You have the tape recordings of the conversations on 28 June when H. had been wired up, between [the applicant] and H., and you have the transcripts of the conversations between H. and the police. I suggest ... that you approach the evidence of H. with the very greatest caution and care. He is a professional criminal. He behaved, and has behaved as he acknowledged, dishonestly and criminally for years. He saw the likelihood of advantage to himself, both in terms of bail and in the sentence that he was likely to receive. You have heard that he has not yet been sentenced on matters for which he was in custody in early 1995. The defence say if you consider the whole picture you simply cannot rely upon H.; quite unsafe to do so. The prosecution say the contents of the tapes of 28 June can be relied on and are consistent with what H. says [the applicant] had said to him previously, before he, H., was wired up. Of course tapes of ... conversations cannot possibly constitute any independent confirmation of what H. says about what [the applicant] had said to him previously, because, and you will understand the logic of that, the information is all coming from one source, namely H. and the witness cannot strengthen his own evidence essentially by repetition.",

He also argued that the judge had erred in his directions as to the circumstances in which the jury could draw inferences from the applicant's failure to respond to police questions in interviews of 28 and 29 June, when the police strategy was to “spook” the applicant into a state of garrulousness when he returned to prison, where he had a conversation with H."

There was no basis for holding that the exercise of his discretion had been so flawed that the Court of Appeal should intervene. In so far as the applicant complained that the judge should have warned the jury not to take into account the applicant's failure to answer police questioning in the light of the police strategy to “spook” him, Lord Justice Rose found that the judge had given an entirely appropriate direction to the jury in the circumstances of the case."

The right protects against the use of State power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities. Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a State agent, the analysis must focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused. The right to silence will only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement.

Parts of the conversation were functionally the equivalent of an interrogation and the appellant's trust in the informer as a friend was used to undermine the appellant's confidence in his lawyer's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the appellant was more likely to talk.”"

It was of no consequence that the police officer was engaged in a subterfuge, permitted himself to be misidentified or lied, so long as the responses were not actively elicited or the result of interrogation. In this case the conversation had been initiated by the accused and the police officer picked up the flow and content of the conversation without directing or redirecting it in a sensitive area.

An undercover officer held a conversation with the accused pretending that his own brother-in-law was suspected of arson and the accused made admissions of his own involvement in a fire.

The accused Pavic had been questioned by the police about a disappeared person and remained silent. After his release from custody, Pavic made incriminatory statements to a friend called C., who had been fitted with a listening device by the police. The High Court found that there was no impropriety involved and the admissions were reliable and should be admitted. C. had not been a police officer or a person in authority over Pavic. The fact that C. was regarded as trustworthy by Pavic was an indicator of the reliability of the admissions; a serious crime had been committed and there was no public interest to be served by rejecting the admissions.

It is whether the trick may be thought to involve such unfairness to the accused or otherwise to be so contrary to public policy that a court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence notwithstanding its high probative value. In the case of covertly obtained confessions, the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police (or by a person acting as an agent of the police) in unfair derogation of the suspect's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent.”",

As regards the use of the evidence from the surveillance at trial, the applicant submitted that the remarks recorded on tape were not an accurate reflection of the Kwik -Save murder, referring to discrepancies with regard to what in fact happened. The time over which the recordings were made, namely, weeks, was oppressive. As he was aware of the possible recording, he was in a no-win situation because if he whispered or gestured, that was said to be incriminating, and if his remarks were not incriminating, he was said to be tailoring his remarks for the microphone. The tapes were also used in the police interviews to unsettle the applicant and set him up for adverse inferences in the event that he exercised his right to silence. This case was also different from that in Khan (cited above) relied on by the Government as the recording in this case was much more invasive and protracted and the evidence obtained filled with inaccuracies and unreliable."

The police used H. not as an inanimate listening post but as a means of conducting surreptitious interrogation, circumventing the protections for a suspect who has availed himself of legal advice and exercised the right to silence (referring to the Canadian authorities' finding that this constituted a violation of the right to silence, Hebert and Broyles, both cited above). In particular, on 28 June 1995 the applicant was removed from prison to a police station and interrogated for a day as a “softening-up” process prior to his being questioned by H. The applicant's conviction was based substantially, if not decisively, on the evidence put forward by H. who was a persistent criminal under threat of sentencing which would depend on his role in the applicant's trial. The one and only alleged admission by the applicant of presence at the scene of the murder was not recorded but rested solely on the H.'s word. This was in all circumstances unfair and oppressive. The applicant further disputed that he suspected H.'s role in this connection or could in any way be regarded as waiving his right to complain about it."

The Government submitted, relying on Khan, cited above, that the admission at trial of recorded evidence obtained secretly by the police under the Guidelines did not violate Article 6. The surveillance had been lawful in domestic terms, there was no reason to suppose that the tapes were not an accurate reflection of what was said, they had not been obtained under any form of pressure and the applicant had an opportunity under domestic law to challenge their use. Furthermore, the tapes were not the only evidence against the applicant and the jury were made fully aware of any possible deficiencies in this evidence. There was no basis on which to distinguish this case from Khan, as in that case no violation was found despite the fact that the recording involved trespass and the evidence obtained was the only evidence against the applicant, whereas in this case the surveillance was lawful under domestic law and the recordings were not the only evidence against the applicant, as there was also the evidence put forward by H. They argued that in serious cases such as murder there was a particularly strong public interest in admitting such material, provided that, as here, the applicant had an opportunity to challenge its use."

Issues of H.'s credibility and reliability were fully argued and explained to the jury which was in a good position to determine whether any findings of fact could be drawn from his statements. The applicant's counsel had been able to cross-examine H. Furthermore, the applicant had spoken voluntarily to H., knowing or at least suspecting that his conversations were being recorded and therefore must be taken as waiving his right to complain about it. There was accordingly no unfairness contrary to Article 6 § 1 in the use of this evidence at trial. Finally, the Government disputed the relevance of the Canadian cases cited by the applicant, noting that the Hebert case concerned the use of evidence actively elicited by an undercover agent (not covert audio- or video-recordings) and which was the only evidence against the accused, while in Broyles the information given by the accused to his visitor was obtained in the functional equivalent of an interrogation and the accused's special trust in his friend exploited."

                "42. The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, §§ 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1998-IV, p. 1462, § 34). It is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, unlawfully obtained evidence – may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found."

In that context, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected, in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use, as well as the opportunity of examining any relevant witnesses; whether the admissions made by the applicant during the conversations were made voluntarily, there being no entrapment and the applicant being under no inducement to make such admissions (see Khan, cited above, § 36); and the quality of the evidence, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubts on its reliability or accuracy (ibid., § 37). While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (ibid.)."

                "44. As regards the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to silence, the Court has reiterated that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure. Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, p. 49, § 45). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2064, §§ 68-69). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court will examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III).",

The Court notes that the recordings made of the applicant in the police station and prison when he was with Leroy Grant, J.N.S. and H. and the testimony of H. who had been placed in the applicant's cell by the police to obtain evidence against him constituted the principal evidence relied on by the prosecution at his trial."

Similarly, there is no suggestion that any admissions made by the applicant during the conversations taped with Leroy Grant and J.N.S. were not voluntary in the sense that the applicant was coerced into making them or that there was any entrapment or inducement. Indeed, the applicant has stated that he was aware that he was possibly being taped while in the police station."

            [
                "47. The applicant has argued that the evidence from the recordings was unreliable and contained many inconsistencies, while the Government have pointed to the admissions that it contained which were probative of the applicant's knowledge of the incident. As the applicant alleged that he knew of the possible recording and as the tapes indicated that a certain amount of whispering or gesturing was being carried out at times, the Court considers that an assessment of the strength or the reliability of the evidence concerned is not a straightforward matter. The applicant's conduct as a whole must have played a role in the assessment of the evidence and this Court is not well-placed to express a view. In those circumstances, the existence of fair procedures to examine the admissibility and test the reliability of the evidence takes on an even greater importance."

            [
                "48. In that regard, the Court notes that the applicant's counsel challenged the admissibility of the recordings in a voir dire, and was able to put forward arguments to exclude the evidence as unreliable, unfair or obtained in an oppressive manner. The judge, in a careful ruling however, admitted the evidence, finding that it was of probative value and had not been shown to be so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to decide for themselves. This decision was reviewed on appeal by the Court of Appeal which found that the judge had taken into account all the relevant factors and that his ruling could not be faulted. At each step of the procedure, the applicant had therefore been given an opportunity to challenge the reliability and significance of the recording evidence. The Court is not persuaded that the use of the taped material concerning Leroy Grant and J.N.S. at the applicant's trial conflicted with the requirements of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

While the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination are primarily designed to protect against improper compulsion by the authorities and the obtaining of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused, the scope of the right is not confined to cases where duress has been brought to bear on the accused or where the will of the accused has been directly overborne in some way. The right, which the Court has previously observed is at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure, serves in principle to protect the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police. Such freedom of choice is effectively undermined in a case in which, the suspect having elected to remain silent during questioning, the authorities use subterfuge to elicit, from the suspect, confessions or other statements of an incriminatory nature, which they were unable to obtain during such questioning and where the confessions or statements thereby obtained are adduced in evidence at trial."

Whether the right to silence is undermined to such an extent as to give rise to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention depends on all the circumstances of the individual case. In this regard, however, some guidance may be found in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, referred to in paragraphs 30-32 above, in which the right to silence, in circumstances which bore some similarity to those in the present case, was examined in the context of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There, the Canadian Supreme Court expressed the view that, where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused was not obviously a State agent, the analysis should focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused: the right to silence would only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement. Whether an informer was to be regarded as a State agent depended on whether the exchange between the accused and the informer would have taken place, and in the form and manner in which it did, but for the intervention of the authorities. Whether the evidence in question was to be regarded as having been elicited by the informer depended on whether the conversation between him and the accused was the functional equivalent of an interrogation, as well as on the nature of the relationship between the informer and the accused."

                "52. In the present case, the Court notes that in his interviews with the police following his arrest the applicant had, on the advice of his solicitor, consistently availed himself of his right to silence. H., who was a long-standing police informer, was placed in the applicant's cell in Stretford police station and later at the same prison for the specific purpose of eliciting from the applicant information implicating him in the offences of which he was suspected. The evidence adduced at the applicant's trial showed that the police had coached H. and instructed him to “push him for what you can”. In contrast to the position in Khan, the admissions allegedly made by the applicant to H., and which formed the main or decisive evidence against him at trial, were not spontaneous and unprompted statements volunteered by the applicant, but were induced by the persistent questioning of H., who, at the instance of the police, channelled their conversations into discussions of the murder in circumstances which can be regarded as the functional equivalent of interrogation, without any of the safeguards which would attach to a formal police interview, including the attendance of a solicitor and the issuing of the usual caution. While it is true that there was no special relationship between the applicant and H. and that no factors of direct coercion have been identified, the Court considers that the applicant would have been subjected to psychological pressures which impinged on the “ voluntariness ” of the disclosures allegedly made by the applicant to H.: he was a suspect in a murder case, in detention and under direct pressure from the police in interrogations about the murder, and would have been susceptible to persuasion to take H., with whom he shared a cell for some weeks, into his confidence. In those circumstances, the information gained by the use of H. in this way may be regarded as having been obtained in defiance of the will of the applicant and its use at trial impinged on the applicant's right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination."

The Court notes that the Government have not contended that the officers’ intervention took place as part of an anti-drug-trafficking operation ordered and supervised by a judge. It does not appear either that the competent authorities had good reason to suspect that Mr Teixeira de Castro was a drug trafficker; on the contrary, he had no criminal record and no preliminary investigation concerning him had been opened. Indeed, he was not known to the police officers, who only came into contact with him through the intermediary of V.S. and F.O. (see paragraph 10 above). Furthermore, the drugs were not at the applicant’s home; he obtained them from a third party who had in turn obtained them from another person (see paragraph 11 above). Nor does the Supreme Court’s judgment of 5 May 1994 indicate that, at the time of his arrest, the applicant had more drugs in his possession than the quantity the police officers had requested thereby going beyond what he had been incited to do by the police. There is no evidence to support the Government’s argument that the applicant was predisposed to commit offences. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the two police officers did not confine themselves to investigating Mr Teixeira de Castro’s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence.",

In connection with an operation monitoring drug trafficking, two plain-clothes officers of the Public Security Police (PSP) from the Famalição police station approached an individual, V.S., on a number of occasions. He was suspected of petty drug trafficking in order to pay for drugs – mainly hashish – for his own consumption. They hoped that through V.S. they would be able to identify his supplier and offered to buy several kilograms of hashish from him. Unaware that they were police officers, V.S. agreed to find a supplier. However, despite being pressed by the two officers, he was unable to locate one."

All four then went to the applicant’s home in the purported buyers’ car. The applicant came outside at F.O.’s request and got into the car where the two officers, accompanied by V.S., were waiting.

It does not appear either that the competent authorities had good reason to suspect that Mr Teixeira de Castro was a drug trafficker; on the contrary, he had no criminal record and no preliminary investigation concerning him had been opened. Indeed, he was not known to the police officers, who only came into contact with him through the intermediary of V.S. and F.O. (see paragraph 10 above). Furthermore, the drugs were not at the applicant’s home; he obtained them from a third party who had in turn obtained them from another person (see paragraph 11 above). Nor does the Supreme Court’s judgment of 5 May 1994 indicate that, at the time of his arrest, the applicant had more drugs in his possession than the quantity the police officers had requested thereby going beyond what he had been incited to do by the police. There is no evidence to support the Government’s argument that the applicant was predisposed to commit offences. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the two police officers did not confine themselves to investigating Mr Teixeira de Castro’s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence.",

She argued that if her telephone had been tapped during this period there must exist recordings not only of her conversations with S. but also of those with the FSB agents who had called her and talked her into selling cannabis in particularly large quantities. The “previous sales of drugs” that she had admittedly discussed with S. had also involved the same FSB agents as buyers. The courts had not established that she had ever sold, or even contemplated selling, drugs to anyone except the FSB agents. The recordings of her conversations with S. made it clear that at first the applicant had not been aware of prices for drugs and had not been sure whether it was possible to obtain the requested amount of cannabis.

The relevant finding in the Milinienė case reads as follows :",

Thereafter the police approached the Deputy Prosecutor General who authorised and followed the further investigation within the legal framework of a criminal conduct simulation model, affording immunity from prosecution to SŠ in exchange for securing evidence against the suspected offender.",

To the extent that SŠ had police backing to offer the applicant considerable financial inducements and was given technical equipment to record their conversations, it is clear that the police influenced the course of events. However, the Court does not find that police role to have been abusive, given their obligation to verify criminal complaints and the importance of thwarting the corrosive effect of judicial corruption on the rule of law in a democratic society. Nor does it find that the police role was the determinative factor. The determinative factor was the conduct of SŠ and the applicant. To this extent, the Court accepts that, on balance, the police may be said to have ‘ joined ’ the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention .. .”"

The applicant then offered to supply them himself. As the transaction progressed, the applicant was offered a significant sum of money – USD 3,000 – to supply a large amount of narcotics. This obviously represented an inducement to produce the goods. The first instance court recognised the determinative part played by the police ... These elements in the present case, in the Court ’ s view, extended the police ’ s role beyond that of undercover agents to that of ‘ agents provocateurs ’. They did not merely ‘ join ’ an on-going offence; they instigated it. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the police did not confine themselves to investigating the applicant ’ s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence ... ”"

When drawing the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and instigation of a crime the Court will examine the question whether the applicant was subjected to pressure to commit the offence. It has found the abandonment of a passive attitude by the investigating authorities to be associated with such conduct as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, renewing the offer despite his initial refusal, insistent prompting, raising the price beyond average ( see, among other cases, Malininas, cited above, § 37) or appealing to the applicant ’ s compassion by mentioning withdrawal symptoms ( see Vanyan, cited above, § § 11 and 49 ).

In practice, the authorities may be prevented from discharging this burden by the absence of formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation. In this context, in the case of Teixeira de Castro (cited above, § 38) the Court found that the undercover agent ’ s activity was not part of an operation ordered and supervised by a judge, distinguishing it on this ground from the case of Lüdi ( cited above ), where the police officer concerned had been sworn in, the investigating judge had been aware of his task and a preliminary investigation had been opened."

Therefore, in public - interest immunity cases the Court has considered it essential to examine the procedure whereby the plea of incitement was determined in order to ensure that the rights of the defence were adequately protected, in particular the right to adversarial proceedings and to equality of arms (see Edwards and Lewis, cited above, §§ 46-48, and, mutatis mutandis, Jasper, cited above, §§ 50 and 58). The procedure in the cases in question consisted of the following. The public - interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 § 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national - security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial ( see A. and Others, cited above, § § 205 et seq.)."

Although the above cases concerned the specific situation of non ­ disclosure of information admitted as evidence, the Court has adopted a broader application of the principles set out therein, extending them to the entire procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined (see Ramanauskas, §§ 60-61; Malininas, § 34; V. v. Finland, § § 76 et seq.; and Khudobin, § 133, all cited above ). Even if the information in question was not part of the prosecution file and had not been admitted as evidence, the court ’ s duty to examine the incitement plea and ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires that all relevant information, particularly regarding the purported suspicions about the applicant ’ s previous conduct, be put openly before the trial court or tested in an adversarial manner (see V. v. Finland, § § 76 et seq., and Malininas, § 36, both cited above; and, mutatis mutandis, Bulfinsky v. Romania, no. 28823/04, 1 June 2010)."

For the same reasons the Court will generally require that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (see Lüdi, § 49; Sequeira; Shannon; and Bulfinsky, § 45, all cited above; and Kuzmickaja v. Lithuania ( dec .), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008 ).",

Firstly, she alleged that her criminal conviction for drug dealing had been the result of entrapment by the FSB agents who had induced her to sell them cannabis. Secondly, she contended that at the trial she could not effectively plead incitement as her defence because of her inability to access the material from the preliminary investigation. She claimed that she had therefore been deprived of a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges against her."

                "67. As follows from the general principles set out above, the first question to be examined by the Court when confronted with a plea of entrapment is whether the State agents carrying out the undercover activity remained within the limits of “essentially passive” behaviour or went beyond them, acting as agents provocateurs. In addressing this question, the Court will apply the substantive test of incitement set out in paragraphs 37 - 50 above; its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities preceding the offence, in particular the details of encounters between the State agents and the applicant before the test purchase. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraphs 51 - 65 above."

Turning to arguments adduced in the present case as regards the substantive test, the Court observes that the parties disagreed as to whether the FSB had carried out the investigation in the applicant ’ s case in an essentially passive manner. In particular, they differed as to the role of the undercover agent in the applicant ’ s sale of cannabis in connection with the test purchase and the applicant ’ s previous involvement in trading drugs before that agent ’ s intervention."

The Court observes that the applicant began to arrange the sale in question in September 2004, allegedly through a certain Vladimir, who requested her to sell him large quantities of cannabis and harassed her into that deal. Until 28 January 2005 the applicant was preparing the sale, acting as an intermediary between S., the supplier, and Vladimir. According to the applicant ’ s own testimonies in court, her first encounter with the FSB undercover agent B. took place on 29 January 2005, immediately before the test purchase. By that stage the FSB already possessed recordings of her conversations with S., which had taken place between 23 and 27 January 2005, concerning the ongoing drug sale. It follows from that account that the FSB agent B. stepped into the transaction when it was already under way. Therefore, as far as B. ’ s role is concerned, it is beyond doubt that he merely “joined in ” the criminal acts rather than instigated them."

In so far as the applicant could be understood as claiming that Vladimir had also acted on the instructions of the FSB, the Court is unable to see any indication of such a link on the basis of the case file. It observes that the materials in its possession contain no account of the initial phase of the transaction other than that given by the applicant at the trial. It cannot therefore determine with certainty whether Vladimir ’ s alleged involvement was part of the undercover operation, and if so, whether he exerted pressure on the applicant to commit the offence at issue."

Nevertheless, the 2004 visit did not allow the concern of the Committee to be alleviated. In fact, most recommendations made have not been implemented.",

Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited access; artificial light – with rare exceptions – was mediocre. Nowhere did the persons obliged to spend the night in detention receive mattresses and blankets, even those detained for prolonged periods. Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives...",
                "45. As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in 2001 (see paragraph 57 of the report on that visit): generally three modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning, a bowl of cereal at noon and tea or warm water in the evening. Sometimes there was only one distribution of food per day. Fortunately, the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed, which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre daily portions.",

In its report on the 1998 visit (paragraph 56), the CPT was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and, in addition, constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained. While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments overnight, the CPT recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity.",
                "54. Unfortunately, during the 2001 visit, the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures, in fact quite the opposite. For example, the renovation and reconstruction of the cells of the EDP of the Department for the fight against organised crime and corruption in Chişinău (reopened in 2000), which were supposed to reflect the CPT's 1998 recommendations, turned out to have had quite the contrary effect. All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the CPT at the time had been faithfully reproduced: cells without access to natural light, artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on, inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses (although certain prisoners did have their own blankets). A similar conclusion can be drawn about the new section of the Bălţi EDP set aside for administrative detainees.",

One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the Moldovan authorities have paid no attention to the CPT recommendations. In fact, this state of affairs strongly suggests that, setting aside economic considerations, the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty.",

A detailed description is superfluous, since it has all been highlighted already in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the report on the 1998 visit.",

This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning, cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in the evening. In some establishments, food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup. ...",

Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time, the CPT wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of one or several other persons, in a confined space such as the EDP cells which also serve as their living space, is in itself degrading, not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening.

On an unspecified date the Moldovan authorities requested the German authorities to extradite him in view of serving the sentence. The application for extradition was examined by the German courts and a final verdict was adopted by the Supreme Court of the Land of Thuringia in a judgment of 25 January 2007.",

In particular, the court found that the applicant and other co-accused were subjected to torture and pressure in order to confess to the offences imputed to them or to incriminate other co-accused. In finding the above, the court relied on witness testimonies to the effect that G.D. had signs of violence on his body during the court hearings. The allegations of ill-treatment were consistent with reports of German and International bodies specialised in the protection of human rights. The court relied, inter alia, on a report of the German Government concerning the Republic of Moldova, in which it was stated that the Moldovan justice system lacked independence from the Government and that ill-treatment and torture by police was a wide spread practice in Moldova. The court also relied on several other reports from Amnesty International and UN and EU bodies specialised in the prevention of torture with similar allegations concerning Moldova. The court also noted that the judge of the Court of Appeal who acquitted G.D. (see paragraph 11 above) was subsequently dissmissed.",

However, even assuming that the name Micu had been used as the denomination of the criminal organisation but not as the applicant's name, as suggested by the Government, the result remains the same. A statement that a criminal organisation bears one's name constitutes an implicit accusation that the initial bearer of the name (the person) is somehow involved with the gang. Otherwise there would simply be no reason for the gang to bear his name. Accordingly, Mr Gurbulea's statement was clearly a declaration of the applicant's guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.

However, in the instant case the Court finds that the exclusion of the public was necessary, having regard to the classified character of the evidence and the State ’ s legitimate interest in prosecuting drug-related offences. The exclusion of the public was further warranted by the need to keep secret police methods of investigation that had been used in the applicants ’ case and to take evidence from police officers who had carried out the covert operations. Moreover, the exclusion of the public needs to be seen in the context of the fact that no evidence was withheld from the defence and the Court ’ s finding that the fairness of the proceedings had not been infringed. The Court also notes that the applicants ’ counsel did not object to the decision to hold the hearing in camera.

Counsel could memorise the content of the evidence they consulted, then use it, while respecting the requirements of confidentiality, either when pleading at the closed hearings or with due diligence in their written submissions. ( ... ) Those were then not limitations on the rights of the defence, but rather certain impediments in conducting the defence, in any case impediments of a minor degree. In the Court of Appeal ’ s view, those limitations were necessary since part of the evidence was classified. If they [those limitations] were not applied, the interests protected by the regulation on classified information would be affected. [Those limitations] are present in every case concerning classified information, and thus alleging shortcomings in this respect does not concern just this particular case but relates generally to the principle of the determination of criminal charges based on evidence covered by the regulation on classified information. That would then be a claim of unconstitutionality in respect of the determination of such cases due to the limitation by that regulation of the constitutionally protected rights of the defence (Article 42 § 2 of the Constitution), which is far-reaching, unjustified and – for the Court of Appeal – unconvincing.

That would not be reasonable and it is not provided for by law. ( ... ) In other words, the Court of Appeal examines whether the evidence the Regional Court took as the basis for its ruling was sufficient for it to give the ruling or whether there was insufficient evidentiary basis for it. The Court of Appeal considers that there was sufficient evidence to give the judgment, and thus the judgment [of the Regional Court ] has adequate evidentiary basis (with one reservation in respect of the presence of the drug in the parcel ).

This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby people ’ s confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the principles of any democratic society (see, amongst many other authorities, Stefanelli v. San-Marino, no. 35396/97, § 19, ECHR 2000 ‑ II, and Olujić v. Croatia, no. 22330/05, § 70, 5 February 2009)."

France, 26 September 1995, § 34, Series A no. 325-A, and Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, § 40, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... )."

                "75. The Court ’ s task is to establish whether the exclusion of the public from the hearing was justified. In the present case the trial court, at the request of the prosecutor, decided to hold the entire hearing in camera on the basis of Article 360 § 1 (3) of the CCP, considering that a public hearing might disclose matters which should remain confidential in the light of the State interests at stake. The Court observes that the counsel for the first applicant did not object to the prosecutor ’ s request and the counsel for the second applicant left it to the court ’ s decision. The trial court did not specify what particular circumstances justified its decision. However, the Court accepts that the decision at issue – as submitted by the Government – was based on the need to keep secret certain police methods of investigation. The Court of Appeal also decided to hold the hearing in camera and stated clearly that the reasons for doing so were related to the examination of classified evidence. In the Court ’ s view, the domestic courts had reason to consider that “ publicity would prejudice the interests of justice” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, having regard to the covert police operations carried out in the case, and the need to examine the resultant classified evidence and to hear police officers involved in the covert operations."
            ],
            [
                "76. Next, the Court has to examine whether the exclusion of the public was “strictly necessary” in the circumstances of the case. In this connection, it notes that it appears that, at all but the first hearing, the trial court examined classified evidence related to the secret recordings and the interception of the parcel, or heard police officers who had been involved in the covert interception of the parcel, the examination of its content and the search of the first applicant ’ s flat. In respect of the secret recordings, the Court notes that the trial court heard that evidence and subsequently, after the close of the trial, decided to exclude it. The applicants argued that since all classified evidence was excluded there was no reason to hold the hearing in camera. However, the Court does not subscribe to this argument. It notes that after the close of the trial, the Regional Court decided to exclude as unlawful part of the classified evidence obtained by means of secret recordings. But that evidence was not the only classified evidence heard by the trial court, which also examined evidence related to the covert interception and surveillance of the parcel and heard police officers involved in the covert interception. The Court of Appeal excluded the public from the hearing precisely in order to examine the circumstances related to the covert interception of the parcel and the replacement of the cocaine."

            [
                "77. The Court has considered that the mere presence of classified information in the case file does not automatically imply a need to close a trial to the public, without balancing openness with other public interest considerations (see, Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 83, 4 December 2008). However, in the instant case the Court finds that the exclusion of the public was necessary, having regard to the classified character of the evidence and the State ’ s legitimate interest in prosecuting drug-related offences. The exclusion of the public was further warranted by the need to keep secret police methods of investigation that had been used in the applicants ’ case and to take evidence from police officers who had carried out the covert operations. Moreover, the exclusion of the public needs to be seen in the context of the fact that no evidence was withheld from the defence and the Court ’ s finding that the fairness of the proceedings had not been infringed. The Court also notes that the applicants ’ counsel did not object to the decision to hold the hearing in camera. This must be seen as a weighty consideration (see, Boyle and Ford v. the United Kingdom ( dec .), nos. 29949/07 and 33213/07, 22 June 2010, § 49). Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the exclusion of the public in the present case can be considered to have been strictly necessary."

Furthermore, the Court observes that, in accordance with Article 361 § 1 of the CCP, in the case of a hearing held in camera, a defendant has the right to indicate a person of trust to attend the hearing. It appears that the applicants, who were represented by counsel, did not make use of that possibility.

As a general rule, the form of publicity to be given to the judgment under domestic law must be assessed in the light of the special features of the proceedings in question and by reference to the object and purpose of Article 6 § 1. In making this assessment, account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings (see, Pretto and Others v. Italy, 8 December 1983, § 25 ‑ 27, Series A no. 71; Axen v.

In particular, it stated: “[T]he presidential pardon did not constitute an isolated act or separate procedure; in the present case, there was a close relation between all the proceedings and, in order to provide an overall view of the issues, it was considered appropriate to examine the chronology of the various sets of criminal proceedings brought against the applicant, the conduct of those proceedings and the merits of the decisions that were taken. ” There were thus two separate parts to the report: one on the legality of the presidential pardon and the other on the decisions of the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.",

Since he had not made his request in the terms referred to above, the committee considered that his pardon did not satisfy the regulatory requirements in force and was therefore invalid. It also noted a number of other failings: “the [applicant's] file” had not been submitted to the Pardons Board appointed by the Georgian President, the applicant's name was not on the combined list of convicted persons seeking a pardon that was submitted to the President by the Ajarian authorities concerned and no appraisal of the applicant had been furnished by the Ajarian prison authorities in support of his request."

In particular, it considered that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had ruled on matters beyond the scope of the application, as the company had not sought an order reopening the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The Court of Appeal should not, therefore, have ruled on the lawfulness of the applicant's continued detention. Since those two issues were within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts, not the administrative courts, the committee considered that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal should have restricted its review to the legality of the contested presidential act."

In its view, instead of “ignoring Mr David Assanidze's and Mr Nodar Shotadze's attempts to implicate the applicant in serious offences”, the judges of the Supreme Court of Georgia who heard the applicant's appeal on points of law should have brought “new criminal proceedings against [ the applicant ] in accordance with Article 257 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time”, that is to say, in 1993."

It should have sought to establish by whom and in what circumstances that meeting – at which Mr David Assanidze had accused the applicant off the record of taking part in his group's activities – had been recorded, and why the judge concerned had not mentioned it in his judgment of 20 September 1996."

In so doing, the committee had, in his view, contravened the fundamental constitutional rule requiring the separation of powers. The report undermined the notions of democracy and the rule of law. The President of the Supreme Court said that under the Constitution no one had the right to demand an explanation from a judge about a case.

He further noted that in many countries there was no right of appeal against a pardon, which constituted the ultimate act of humanity. The fact that the applicant's request for a pardon had not been examined beforehand by the Presidential Pardons Board could not render the pardon illegal, especially as, in the applicant's case, obtaining his file and details from the Ajarian prison authorities had been no easy task. The President of the Supreme Court of Georgia also pointed out that, in the instant case, the grant of a pardon also represented an attempt at restoring justice to a convicted prisoner who had been held for years in an unlawful place of detention."

The President of the Supreme Court of Georgia said that it was regrettable that the committee had omitted to mention that the Ajarian High Court had on 11 November 1999, in breach of the law then in force, assumed jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial review of a pardon granted by the President of Georgia."

That is confirmed by the fact that, firstly, Article 1 does not exclude any part of the member States'“jurisdiction” from the scope of the Convention and, secondly, it is with respect to their “jurisdiction” as a whole – which is often exercised in the first place through the Constitution – that member States are called on to show compliance with the Convention ( see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998- I, pp. 17 ‑ 18, § 29)."

Where powers are distributed along decentralised lines, it refers to any national authority exercising public functions.

That presidential decree was immediately challenged by the Batumi Tobacco Manufacturing Company in the Ajarian High Court (see paragraph 24 above). That challenge itself operated to stay execution of the pardon in accordance with Article 29 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraph 115 above) and the judgment of 28 November 1994 continued to serve as the basis for the applicant's detention. Since the proceedings in the administrative courts only ended with the Supreme Court of Georgia's judgment of 11 July 2000 dismissing the Batumi Tobacco Manufacturing Company's appeal on points of law at last instance (see paragraph 29 above), the basis for the applicant's detention from 1 October to 11 December 1999 was the judgment of 28 November 1994 and the detention therefore complied both with domestic law and the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention."

It merely observes that the administrative authorities taken as a whole form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice ( see Hornsby, cited above, p. 511, § 41 ). If the State administrative authorities could refuse or fail to comply with a judgment acquitting a defendant, or even delay in doing so, the Article 6 guarantees the defendant previously enjoyed during the judicial phase of the proceedings would become partly illusory."

If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and make all feasible reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach ( see Maestri v.

As regards the measures which the Georgian State must take (see paragraph 198 above), subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, in order to put an end to the violation that has been found, the Court reiterates that its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and that, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta, cited above, § 249; Brumărescu v.

Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 25, § 58).

The applicant’s mother stated that she had not been driving. As regards the applicant, she stated that he was not home yet and showed the police officers the applicant’s room in which his bed was untouched. Further, she stated that the car was regularly used by several family members. She was requested to send the applicant to the police station as soon as he came in.

As the injured party, [Mr K.], could not determine at the time of the accident who had been driving the vehicle, the only evidence which remained in connection with this point were the observations of the Obermieming police station, according to which it was common knowledge that the vehicle in question was mainly driven by the accused, ... On the basis of those observations the court is also satisfied that [the applicant] was driving the vehicle at the material time and caused the accident. The additional circumstance that, according to the observations of the Obermieming police station, the accused was not at home after the accident and had evidently still not returned by 8 p.m. that day and, moreover, that no one knew where he was, leads to the sole, unequivocal conclusion that only the accused could have committed the offence; presumably he refused to make a statement because he was under the influence of alcohol, but there is no evidence for that finding.

It is the case that the person claiming damages in criminal proceedings was only able to identify the car and could not describe the occupant or occupants of the vehicle. From the evidence it is established, however, that the car, registered in the name of the accused’s mother, is mainly used by the accused, even if it is also occasionally used by others, such as the accused’s sister. It would have been open to the accused to give a contrary version of events which conflicted with the charges and to put in relevant evidence without thereby at the same time having to name another person as the driver. That was evidently impossible, however, because having spent the night away from his parents’ house and possibly consuming alcohol he had on 8 April 1995 driven his mother’s car through Obsteig. The court of first instance correctly referred to the observations of the police officers to the effect that immediately after the accident the car was indeed in front of the parents’ house, yet the accused’s bed had not been slept in and he could not be found. Nor could it be ascertained where the accused, who refused to make a written statement to the police, was staying. On the basis of the available evidence before it the court of first instance made a realistic assessment of the facts, especially as there was no evidence that anyone else, such as the accused’s sister, had been driving the car at the time of the accident.”",

His conviction could neither be based on his “not guilty” plea, as he had clearly stated that he had not driven the car at the material time, nor on the statement of the victim, who had not even been able to identify whether the driver was male or female. His mother and sister had exercised their right not to testify. The courts relied on the allegation made in the police report, according to which the car at issue was mainly used by him. Even if it were established that he generally used the car, neither this fact nor the fact that he had not passed the night at his mother’s house permitted the “sole, unequivocal conclusion” that he had driven the car at the time of the accident.

The Government maintained that the applicant was given ample opportunity to defend himself and to refute the evidence adduced at the trial or to produce evidence in his favour. However, the applicant merely stated that he had not been using his mother’s vehicle and otherwise chose to remain silent, thus waiving the opportunity to refute the evidence against him. The courts’ conclusion that the applicant was guilty was – in view of the fact that the car at issue had mostly been used by the applicant, that it was parked in front of his parental home, that the applicant’s bed had not been slept in, that the latter could not be found and that there was no indication that someone else had driven the car – free from contradiction, realistic and not at all far-fetched."

Article 6 § 2 requires, inter alia, that when carrying out their duties, the members of a court should not start with the preconceived idea that the accused has committed the offence charged; the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and any doubt should benefit the accused (see the Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, pp. 31 and 33, §§ 67-68 and 77).

The Court recalls that the above-mentioned John Murray judgment concerned a case in which the law allowed for the drawing of common-sense inferences from the accused’s silence, where the prosecution had established a case against him, which called for an explanation. Considering that the evidence adduced at the trial constituted a formidable case against the applicant, the Court found that the drawing of such inferences, which was moreover subject to important procedural safeguards, did not violate Article 6 in the circumstances of the case (ibid.). The Court considers that the drawing of inferences from an accused’s silence may also be permissible in a system like the Austrian one where the courts freely evaluate the evidence before them, provided that the evidence adduced is such that the only common-sense inference to be drawn from the accused’s silence is that he had no answer to the case against him."

The Court recalls its established case-law to the effect that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the rights relied on by the applicants, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself, are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6. Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right in question is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see the Saunders judgment cited above, p. 2064, § 68).",

This necessity had been constantly reviewed, most recently in March 1998, when it was decided to maintain the proclamation in force, the Government noting, in this context, that the single worst atrocity of the entire period of the proclamation occurred in August 1998 when twenty-nine persons lost their lives in a bombing in Omagh.

In the first place, the Supreme Court confirmed that Article 38 of the Irish Constitution required that any confession admitted against an accused person in a criminal trial should be a voluntary confession but that court did not, and did not have to, resolve the question of whether a test of proportionality could be applied to dilute the protection offered by Article 38 of the Constitution when, for example, national security matters are alleged to be at issue. The applicants considered this important as the domestic courts in their cases balanced the security concerns underlying the 1939 Act against their constitutional rights, an approach continued by the Government in their submissions to this Court. Secondly, the Supreme Court rejected the contention that no use at all could be made of any such confessions so that it would be for the trial judge to decide in all the circumstances of the case whether it would be fair to admit evidence obtained as a result of or in consequence of a compelled confession.

Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right in question is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see the Saunders judgment cited above, p. 2064, § 68).",

It recalls that the autonomous meaning of the expression “charge” in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention means that a person can be considered to have been “charged” for the purposes of that Article when that individual's situation has been “substantially affected” (see the Serves judgment cited above, p. 2172, § 42)."

The Court found that the customs authorities, being unable or unwilling to procure them by some other means, attempted to compel Mr Funke himself to provide the evidence of offences he had allegedly committed.

The applicants essentially considered that any relevant indications in the domestic case-law prior to the National Irish Bank Ltd judgment cited above indicated that such section 52 statements could be later admitted in evidence against their author and that the latter case did not authoritatively clarify this question. In any event, the applicants pointed to the conflicting cautions given to them on 24 October 1990."

The Government did not refer to any domestic case-law prior to October 1990 which would have authoritatively excluded the later admission into evidence against the applicants of any statements made by them pursuant to those requests. Nor did the Government exclude the possibility that, prior to October 1990, statements made pursuant to section 52 had in fact been admitted in evidence against accused persons. The Government's position was rather that, in any event, the situation had been clarified for the future by the January 1999 judgment in the National Irish Bank Ltd case. This uncertainty about the domestic legal position in October 1990 is underlined by the comments of the Supreme Court in the present applicants' constitutional proceedings on the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the earlier McGowan case (see paragraphs 16 and 26-27 above).",
                "In any event, the applicants were provided with conflicting information in this respect by the questioning police officers on 24 October 1990. At the beginning of their interviews they were informed that they had the right to remain silent. Nevertheless, when the section 52 requests were made during those interviews, they were then effectively informed that, if they did not account for their movements at particular times, they risked six months' imprisonment. The only reference during the interviews to the possible use of statements made by the applicants in any later proceedings was to inform them that anything they did say would be written down and might be used against them."

It considered that the general requirements of fairness contained in Article 6, including the right not to incriminate oneself, “apply to criminal proceedings in respect of all types of criminal offences without distinction from the most simple to the most complex”. It concluded that the public interest could not be relied on to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings.",

The United Kingdom government had relied on the special security context of Northern Ireland to justify the length of the impugned detention periods under Article 5 § 3. The Court found that even the shortest periods of detention at issue in that case would have entailed consequences impairing the very essence of the relevant right protected by Article 5 § 3. It concluded that the fact that the arrest and detention of the applicants were inspired by the legitimate aim of protecting the community as a whole from terrorism was not, on its own, sufficient to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."

This would have made it possible for him first to raise the question of the application in his case of the rules concerning accused persons residing abroad whose whereabouts are known and who have no address for service in the place where the proceedings are conducted (second possibility envisaged under the second paragraph of Article 177 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure, see paragraph 26 above), and then to appeal against his conviction.",
                "The Commission considered nevertheless that the shortness of the time-limit to be complied with - three days from the notification of the judgment, or from the date on which the person concerned had adequate knowledge thereof - made the exercise of such a remedy purely theoretical in the present case."

At the time, the possibility of bringing such an appeal was not expressly provided for in the legislation, but was based only on judicial interpretation of Articles 500 and 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the version then in force (see paragraph 26 above). In addition, in view of the fact that the judgment of 1 July 1981 was not notified to Mr Brozicek in person,the point of time at which the three-day period for lodging notice of intention to appeal began to run was open to doubt. This was acknowledged to some extent by the Government inasmuch as they stated that it was \"probable\" that the dies a quo was not 5 May 1984 but a date in July 1984, when the applicant received a copy of the judgment (see paragraph 23 above).",

Having regard to the parties’ arguments and the circumstances of the case, the Court is of the view that the trial court failed to reach this objective, as the mere four days during which the applicant company could have access to the case materials were insufficient for the applicant company to prepare properly, no matter the number of lawyers in its defence team or the amount of other resources which the applicant company would have been able to commit during its preparations. As regards the Government’s reference to the applicant company’s conduct during the proceedings and its argument that the company had no real need to study that evidence, the Court finds that it was incumbent on the trial court in the situation at hand to ensure that the applicant company had a sufficiently long period of time during which it could study such a voluminous case file and prepare for the trial hearings and it was up to the applicant company to use this time as it wished. As regards the Government’s argument that the trial court was simply doing its best to comply with the two-month time-limit set out in Article 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure for examination of cases of this category, the Court is of the view that even though it is no doubt important to conduct proceedings at good speed, this should not be done at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the relatively short overall duration of the proceedings for a case of such magnitude and complexity."

For all legal purposes, most of these entities were set up as entirely independent from the applicant, i.e. as belonging and being controlled by third persons, although their sole activity consisted of commissioning the applicant company to buy crude oil on their behalf from the company’s own oil-producing subsidiaries and either putting it up for sale on the domestic market or abroad, or first handing it over to the company’s own oil-processing plants and then selling it. There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company, its oil-processing and oil-producing subsidiaries and the trading entities, and the company’s own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead. All the money thus accumulated from sales was then transferred unilaterally to the “Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS”, a commercial entity founded, owned and run by the applicant company. Since at all relevant times the applicant company took part in all of the transactions of the trading companies, but acted as the companies’ agent and never as an owner of the goods produced and processed by its own subsidiaries and since the compensation paid by the trading entities for its services was negligible, the applicant company’s real turnover was never reflected in any tax documents and, consequently, in its tax returns. In addition, most of the trading companies were in fact sham entities, as they were neither present nor operated in the place of their registration. In addition, they had no assets and no employees of their own."

In view of the above, and also since neither the sham entities nor the applicant company qualified for the tax exemptions in question, the report concluded that the company, having acted in bad faith, had failed properly to reflect these transactions in its tax declarations, thus avoiding the payment of VAT, motorway tax, corporate property tax, tax for improvement of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities, tax in respect of sales of fuels and lubricants and profit tax."

On 26 May 2004, at the end of the hearings, the City Court gave its judgment in which, for the most part, it reached the same findings and came to the same conclusions as in the Ministry’s decision of 14 April 2004. Having confirmed the factual findings of the decision of 14 April 2004 in respect of the relations and transactions between the sham companies and the applicant company with reference to sundry pieces of evidence, including the statements by the nominal owners of the trading companies, acknowledging to the true nature of their relations with the applicant company, the court then reasoned as follows:",
                "“... Under section 3 of RF Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 ‘On value-added tax’, part 2 of section 5 and section 4 of RF Law no. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 ‘On motorway funds in the Russian Federation’, subpart ‘ch’ of section 21 of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 ‘On the basics of the tax system’, the sale of goods (works and services) gives rise to an obligation to pay VAT, motorway users’ tax, tax on the sale of oil and oil products and tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities.",
                "Under part 1 of Article 38 of the Tax Code, objects of taxation may consist of the sale of goods (works and services), assets, profit, value of sold goods (works and services) or other objects having value, quantity or physical characteristics on the presence of which the tax legislation bases the obligation to pay tax.",
                "Under part 1 of Article 39 of the Tax Code, sales are defined as the transfer of property rights in respect of goods. Under subpart 1 and 2 of Article 209 of the Civil Code (taking into account Article 11 of the Tax Code) the owner of goods is the person who has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of his property, that is, the person who is entitled to carry out at his own discretion in respect of this property any actions which are not against the law and other legal acts and do not breach the rights and protected interests of other persons ...",
                "The court established that the owner of the oil sold under contracts concluded with organisations registered in low-tax territories had been OAO Yukos. The respondents’ arguments about the unlawfulness of the use of the notion of de facto owner ( фактический собственник ) on the basis that, according to Article 10 (3) and Article 8 (1) part 3 of the Civil Code ... there existed a presumption of good faith on the part of parties involved in civil-law transactions and that therefore the persons indicated as owners in the respective contracts should be regarded as the owners, are baseless, because the above-mentioned organisations never acquired any rights of ownership, use and disposal in respect of oil and oil products ( поскольку прав владения, пользования и распоряжения нефтью и нефтепродуктами у данных организаций не возникало ).",
                "OAO NK Yukos was therefore under an obligation to pay [the taxes], and this obligation has not been complied with in good time.",
                "Article 41 of the Tax Code establishes that profit is an economic gain in monetary form or in kind, which is taken into account if it is possible to evaluate it and in so far as it can be assessed. Under subparts 1 and 2 of section 2 of RF Law no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 ‘On profit tax of enterprises and organisations’ which was then in force, the object of taxation is the gross profit of the enterprise, decreased (or increased) in accordance with the provisions of the present section. The gross profit is the total of revenues (receipts) from the sale of products (works and services), main assets (including plots of land), other property belonging to the enterprise and the profit derived from operations other than sales, less the sum of expenses in respect of these operations. Since it follows from the case file that the economic profit from the sale of oil and oil products was perceived by OAO NK Yukos, it was incumbent on [the applicant company] to comply with the obligation to pay profit tax.",
                "Section 2 of RF Law no. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 ‘On corporate property tax’ taxes the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts which are indicated on the taxpayer’s balance sheet. It follows that the obligation to pay property tax was incumbent on the person who was legally responsible for reflecting the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts on its balance sheet. Since it follows from the materials of the case that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.",
                "The court does not accept the respondent’s arguments that the tax authorities lacked the power to levy taxes from OAO NK Yukos in respect of the sums ... perceived by other organisations. The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad-faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001. At the same time the bad faith of taxpayer OAO NK Yukos and the fact that the proceeds from transactions in oil and oil products were remitted to it is confirmed by the materials of the case file.",
                "The court has also established that the use of tax benefits by organisations which were dependent on OAO NK Yukos and participated in the tax-evasion scheme set up by that company was unlawful.",
                "Pursuant to Article 56 of the Tax Code, tax benefits are recognised as preferences provided for in the tax legislation for certain groups of taxpayers in comparison with other taxpayers, including the possibility of not paying a tax or of paying it at a lower rate.",
                "The court believes that tax payers must use their right to such benefits in good faith.",
                "Meanwhile, it follows from the materials of the case that the taxpayers [concerned] used their right in bad faith.",
                "The entities registered on the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya (OOO Yu-Mordoviya ..., ZAO Yukos-M ..., OAO Alta-Treyd ..., OOO Ratmir ..., OOO Mars XXII ...) applied benefits governed by Law of the Republic of Mordoviya no. 9-Z of 9 March 1999 ‘On conditions for the efficient use of the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya’, which sets out a special taxation procedure for entities, for the purpose of creating beneficial conditions for attracting capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, developing the securities market and creating additional jobs. Under section 2 of that law, this special taxation procedure applies in respect of entities (including foreign entities operating through permanent representative offices established in the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya), established after the entry into force of the law (with the exception of entities conducting leasing activities, banks and other credit institutions) and whose business meets one of the following conditions: export operations, with the resulting quarterly earnings totalling at least 15% of the whole of the entity’s earnings; wholesale trading of combustibles and lubricants and other kinds of hydrocarbons with the resulting quarterly earning totalling at least 70% of the whole of the entity’s earnings; and other conditions enumerated in that law. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Law, the Government of the Republic of Mordoviya passed resolutions on the application of the special taxation procedure in respect of the mentioned entities and, consequently, on the application of the following tax rates: at the rate of 0% in respect of profit tax in so far as it is credited to the republican and local budgets of the Republic of Mordoviya; at the rate of 0% on motorway users’ tax in so far as it is credited to the Territorial Road Fund of the Republic of Mordoviya; and at the rate of 0% on corporate property tax. Moreover, the above-mentioned entities were exempted by local government resolutions from payment of tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities.",
                "However, the special taxation procedure is provided for [by this law] for the purposes of creating favourable conditions in order to attract capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, develop the securities market and create additional jobs. The entities which used those benefits did not actually carry out their activities on the territory of this subject of the Russian Federation, did not attract capital and did not facilitate the strengthening of the Republic’s socio-economic potential, but, on the contrary, inflicted material damage through non-payment of taxes to the budget of the Republic, the local budget and the federal budget. Thus, the use of the tax benefits in respect of these entities was not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Mordoviya but pursued the aim of evading taxes on the production, refining and sales operations in respect of oil and oil products by OAO NK Yukos and is, as a consequence, unlawful.",
                "The entity registered on the territory of the Republic of Kalmykiya (OOO Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya ...) did not pay profit tax, property tax, motorway users’ tax, tax on the acquisition of vehicles and other taxes, under Law no. 12 ‑ P-3 of the Republic of Kalmykiya of 12 March 1999 ‘On tax benefits to enterprises investing in the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya’, which establishes advantages in respect of taxes and duties for the ... taxpayers that invest in the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya and are registered as such enterprises with the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic of Kalmykiya. Moreover, the entity in question was exempt from the payment of local taxes and ... of profit tax to the consolidated budget.",

Since the amounts of benefits declared for tax purposes by the above-mentioned entities and the sums of investment made are obviously not commensurate, application of the advantages is unlawful. The application of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya but pursues the aim of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of the operations of production, refining and sales of oil and oil products and, consequently, is unlawful.",
                "The entity registered in the closed administrative territorial formation (‘ZATO’) town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (OOO Yuksar ...) concluded a tax agreement on the provision of tax concessions with the Sarov municipal administration. The granting of additional tax advantages on the territory of the Sarov ZATO (Federal Nuclear Centre) in 2000 was regulated by the norms of Articles 21 and 56 of the Tax Code, section 58 of Law no. 227-FZ of 31 December 1999 ‘On the federal budget for the year 2000’, section 5 of Law no. 3297-1 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’ of 14 July 1992, Item 2 of Paragraph 30 of Decree no. 222 of the Russian Government of 13 March 2000 ‘On measures for implementation of the Federal Law ‘On the Federal Budget for 2000’ and Regulations ‘On the investment zone of the town of Sarov’, approved by a Resolution of the Sarov Duma on 30 December 1999. According to the tax agreement, the Sarov administration confers advantages in respect of taxes payable into the Sarov budget to the entity in question in the form of a reduction in the share of taxes and other compulsory payments to the budget, up to 25% of the sums due in VAT, property tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users’ tax, tax on vehicle owners, tax on the acquisition of vehicles, profit tax, tax on operations with securities and excise duties; in exchange, the entity undertakes to participate in investment projects (programmes) implemented in the Sarov investment zone or with its participation, aimed at raising additional budget receipts and solving the problems of Sarov’s socio-economic development by transferring quarterly at least 1% of the sum of the tax advantages.",
                "At the same time, according to Paragraph 1 of section 5 of the Federal Law no. 3297-1 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’ of 17 July 1992, additional benefits on taxes and duties are granted by the appropriate local government authorities to entities registered as taxpayers with the authorities of the closed administrative territorial formations in compliance with the above-mentioned law. Entities possessing at least 90% of their capital assets and conducting at least 70% of their activities on the territories of the closed administrative territorial formations (including the requirement that at least 70% of the average number of employees on the payroll must be made up of persons who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question and that at least 70% of the labour remuneration fund must be paid to employees who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question) enjoy the right to obtain the benefits in question. Given that OOO Yuksar did not actually carry out any activity on the territory of Sarov, was not actually present on the territory of Sarov and that there were no assets and production facilities necessary for the procurement and storage of oil on the territory of Sarov, Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the given entity applied the tax advantages unlawfully.",
                "Thus, the use of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Sarov ZATO but pursued the aimed of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of its obligation to pay taxes on production and refining operations and the sale of oil and oil products and is, consequently, unlawful.",

Reasoning from the contents and meaning of the tax agreements, it follows that their purpose was implementation of the particularly important socio-economic task of developing the educational, medical and housing spheres in the Trekhgornyy ZATO. At the same time, the sums which were transferred to the budget by the taxpayers in question were many times lower than the sums of the declared tax advantages (the sum of investments is around 0.006% of the sum of the advantages for each taxpayer). Thus, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of Trekhgornyy’s economy. On the contrary, since the above-mentioned organisations did not in fact carry out any activities, were never located on the territory of Trekhgornyy, had no assets and none of the production facilities necessary to buy and store oil on the territory of Trekhgornyy, the application of tax advantages by the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’.",

[However], the amounts received from the taxpayers are many times lower than the totals of the declared tax advantages. Accordingly, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of the economy of the town of Lesnoy because the above-mentioned organisations never carried out any activities on the territory of Lesnoy, were never in fact located on the territory of Lesnoy and had no assets and none of the production facilities required to sell and store oil on the territory of Lesnoy, [and thus] the application of the tax advantages in respect of the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’.",

The mentioned organisation was registered in the given district solely for the purpose of acquiring the right to the tax concession that could be granted in the Evenk Autonomous District. The use of the tax benefits by the organisation in question is not aimed at strengthening of economy of the Evenk Autonomous District, but is instead aimed at tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of extraction and processing transactions and the sale of oil and oil products and is thus unlawful.",

As regards the argument that the Ministry’s calculations were erroneous in that they led to double taxation and the failure to take account of the right to a refund of VAT for export operations, the court noted that, contrary to the applicant company’s allegations, both the revenues and expenses of the sham entities had been taken into account by the Ministry so as to avoid double taxation. In addition, under Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 “On value-added tax”, in order to claim a refund of the VAT paid during export operations a taxpayer had to justify the claim in accordance with a special procedure and the applicant company had failed to apply for a refund either in 2000 or at any later date. As to the argument that the Ministry’s claim was time-barred, the court refuted it with reference to Article 113 of the Tax Code and Decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 21 July 2001. The court held that the rules on limitation periods were inapplicable in the case at issue as the applicant company had acted in bad faith. In response to the company’s argument that the interdependency within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code was only relevant for the purposes of price correction under Article 40 of the Code, the court observed that the interdependency of the sham companies and the applicant company was one of the circumstances on the basis of which the tax authorities had proved that the tax offence had been committed by the applicant company in bad faith."

Since it follows from the materials of the on-site tax inspection that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.",

In order to refute this and establish the taxpayer’s bad faith, the tax authorities have the right – in order to strike a balance between public and private interests – to carry out necessary checks and bring subsequent claims in commercial courts in order to guarantee the payment of taxes to the budget.",

                "The respondent’s argument that OAO NK Yukos had not perceived any economic profit from the application of benefits by the entities mentioned in the decision of the Ministry contradicts the materials of the case. The court had established that OAO NK Yukos received economic profit in the form of unilateral transfers of cash. OAO NK Yukos set up the Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO NK Yukos [to this end].",

The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad-faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001.

In accordance with part 2 of Article 110 of the Tax Code of the RF the tax offence is considered intentional if the person who has committed it knew about the unlawful character of the actions (inactions), wished them or knowingly accepted the possibility of the harmful consequences of such actions (inactions).",

They countered the applicant company’s arguments by saying that the latter’s references were invalid in that they related to the other stage of enforcement proceedings (the collection of debt and not the seizure as such). Furthermore, they argued that Ruling no. 4 of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable since, in the case of Yuganskneftegas, the State had transferred only 38% of the shares and not a controlling block. With regard to the offer of Sibneft stock, the Ministry and bailiffs argued that the applicant company’s rights in respect of these shares had been contested in separate sets of court proceedings and it was therefore risky to accept them as a payment. Lastly, they informed the court that the applicant company had recently hidden the shareholder registers of its three major subsidiaries, OAO Yuganskneftegas, OAO Samaraneftegas and OAO Tomskneft, which, in their view, demonstrated the risk of possible asset-stripping by the applicant company."

As regards the first instance proceedings, at the admissibility stage of proceedings before this Court the applicant company argued that the supporting material underlying the Tax Assessment for 2000 had first been provided to it as a result of the City Court’s decision of 14 May 2004. It alleged that the disclosure did not occur until 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed 24,000 pages of documents, and continued on 18 May 2004 with approximately 45,000 further pages and a further 2,000 pages late on 20 May 2004, i.e. on the eve of the first-instance hearing. The company conceded that its representatives had indeed been given access to all these materials, both prior to the hearings and during the trial, but submitted that the manner and time for such access had been so unsatisfactory that it was of no practical use. It also argued that it had been unable effectively to access the court’s filed documents during the first-instance hearings except during the lunch breaks. Overall, the company insisted that it had had insufficient time to prepare its defence and familiarise itself with the evidence before the court and that it had not had an opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on all of the evidence adduced or observations filed, nor to express its views on every document in the file, contrary to Article 6. It referred to the Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain and Krčmář v. Czech Republic cases. In their post-admissibility observations the company submitted that the Ministry had had sufficient time to disclose the evidence, as the relevant documents had been in the possession of the Ministry and that the Ministry could have disclosed them at any point from 8 December 2003 (some six months before the beginning of the hearing). It further noted that the documents filed by the Ministry had been in complete disorder and had been stored in nineteen plastic crates (ten of them containing six thousand pages each and nine more containing some four thousand pages each) and simply could not be studied properly over such a short period. The documents were kept in a room measuring three to four square metres and containing two chairs, a desk and one window. A request for additional space had been turned down. The above-mentioned conditions were reflected in a record dated 18 May 2004, drawn up by the applicant company’s counsel. The Ministry’s representative had refused to sign it and stated that he disagreed with its contents. More generally, the applicant company criticised the Ministry for bringing an action against it before the expiry of the grace period and argued that the first instance proceedings had been unfair because its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings and that it was under the impression that the first-instance court had pronounced judgment without having studied all the evidence."

            [
                "530. As regards the appeal proceedings, the applicant company also insisted on the breach of Article 6. It submitted that the domestic courts had failed to address the question of whether the abridgement of time had affected its substantive right to a fair hearing and that, equally, it did not rely on Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, referred to by the respondent Government. Also, the rule in Article 267 requiring an appeal to be determined within one month is not respected in practice by the Russian courts; failure to comply with this requirement, even for a whole year, has no consequences for the proceedings. There was, according to the applicant company, no evidence of any particular urgency in listing or resolving the appeal: neither the Ministry, nor the co-appellant, OOO ‘YUKOS’ Moscow, sought expedition when their appeals were lodged and the co-appellant did not oppose the applicant company’s applications to adjourn the appeal hearing. In response to the Government’s criticism suggesting that the company’s appeal was misaddressed by the omission of part of the postal code from the envelope, the applicant stated that no evidence had been provided of any mistake in this respect and that, after all, the appeal had been received by the court and the tax authorities. In any event, the court had made no criticism of the company in relation to the exercise of this appeal. Overall, the abridgement of the appeal period was a serious interference with the company’s right to prepare for the appeal hearings, which failed to cure but rather accentuated the unfairness of the first-instance proceedings, and no substantive reason has been offered as to why this acceleration was lawful, necessary or consistent with the requirements of a fair trial."

Only an application for a stay of enforcement pending an appeal in cassation, coupled with a valid appeal in cassation, could have been effective against the enforcement. In the company’s view, such a valid appeal was strictly dependent on filing of the reasons by the appeal court. The appeal decision had become subject to immediate forcible execution, the company had become liable for an additional surcharge of 7% of the total liability and the opportunity to exercise an effective appeal against these measures had been circumvented.",

                "532. As regards the argument that the company had insufficient time for preparation of the defence, the Government referred in their admissibility observations to the domestic legislation, which established a two-month time-limit for the examination of the case at first instance (Article 134 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure). The applicant company had at least 37 days to prepare its defence from the date of the filing of the suit, which, in view of the above time-limit, had not been unreasonable. Furthermore, the applicant company first became aware of the Ministry’s arguments on 29 December 2003, when the Ministry issued the report indicating the applicant company’s large tax liability and by 12 January 2004 the company had also filed its objections to the report under Article 100 (5) of the Tax Code. Moreover, the principal arguments contained in these objections remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. It could not be said therefore that the applicant company was unprepared to state its case, since it was well aware of the Ministry’s arguments five months prior to the beginning of the court proceedings. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant company’s lawyers were given an opportunity to study the evidence both in court and at the Ministry’s premises throughout May, June and July 2004. According to the documents submitted by the Government, counsel for the applicant company availed themselves of this opportunity at least on two occasions, on 18 and 19 May 2004 respectively. Lastly, the Government argued that the applicant company’s arguments about insufficient time for the preparation of the case had been carefully examined and eventually dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. In their post-admissibility observations the Government also submitted that the proceedings before commercial courts in Russia were generally conducted without serious delays (referring, for instance, to the lack of any cases against Russia on account of length of proceedings before the commercial courts). They further argued that in its submissions the applicant company had asserted generalities and had never mentioned any specific documents to which they had not had proper access. The evidence in question had been documents which were well known to the applicant company, as the Ministry had requested these documents from it during the on-site inspection (the Government relied on Article 101 (2) 4 of the Tax Code in this respect) and that the documents had been itemised in a register dated 17 May 2004 no. 14-3-02/22-13-1 and had been copies of original documentation reflecting the relations between the applicant company and its sham entities. In addition, the Government argued that any number of the company’s lawyers could have come to study the evidence and that the applicant company had apparently felt no need to do so, since it had been represented by eight lawyers in the first-instance proceedings and only two to four of them had studied the documents. Overall, the Government suggested that the dispute was more legal rather than factual, so that the crux of the applicant company’s objections concerned the interpretation of the domestic law rather than controversy about the particular circumstances of the tax evasion. In addition, the Government argued that the appeal hearing constituted a de novo examination of the case and that by then the applicant company had had a perfectly adequate opportunity to review the documentary record. By asking to adjourn the proceedings the applicant merely intended to delay the delivery of the judgment."

The applicant company had brought appeal proceedings against the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004: the possibility of review on both points of fact and law had been expressly provided for by Russian law (Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure) and the company had used it. Under Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, which requires an appeal court to examine the appeals by the parties within a month of the date on which they were filed, the Appeal Court had to examine the case within a month of 1 June 2004, which was the date on which one party to the case, OOO ‘YUKOS’ Moskva, first lodged an appeal brief, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant company lodged its appeal on 17 June 2004. The appeal hearings, which represented a full re-trial of the case within the meaning of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, started on 18 June and lasted eight days, that is, until 29 June 2004, which was in line with the above rule. In addition, the applicant company deliberately delayed the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address. Lastly, the Government underlined that the appeal decision had not been final and had been appealed against by the applicant company both in cassation instance and by way of supervisory review. The Government submitted that the fact that the reasoned copy of the Appeal Court decision of 29 June 2004 had been produced on 9 July 2004 did not affect the fairness of the proceedings as, in any event, it was open to the applicant company to lodge its cassation appeal within a two-month time-limit from the date of delivery of the appeal decision on 29 June 2004, even in the absence of the reasoned copy of the decision. The applicant company had lodged its cassation appeal on 6 July 2004 in the absence of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision.

The Court recalls the the Ministry’s action was lodged under the rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute was insoluble and, regard being had to the circumstances of the case, finds no indication of arbitrariness or unfairness within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention in this connection.",

                "538. The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will get a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 and 67, Series A no. 211; Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 262; mutatis mutandis, Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, §§ 41-45, 3 March 2000). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, § 53, Commission’s report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, and Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 220, 9 October 2008). The facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997, and Galstyan v.

It is true that these two documents were very detailed, and contained the attachments to substantiate the Ministry’s position, and that the applicant company had on a few occasions opportunity to contest them. The fact remains, however, that the object of the trial court’s examination during the hearings of 21 to 26 May 2004 was neither the audit report of 29 December 2003 and the decision of 14 April 2004 as such, nor the copies of the documents allegedly already in possession of the applicant company, but rather the Ministry’s court claims based on the above-mentioned two documents and the additional body of evidence filed by the Ministry and comprising at least 43,000 pages. It is clear to the Court that in order to provide the applicant company with an adversarial trial and “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [its] defence” the applicant company should have been given an adequate opportunity to study the entirety of these documents and, more generally, to prepare for the hearings of the merits of the case on reasonable terms."

As regards the Government’s reference to the applicant company’s conduct during the proceedings and its argument that the company had no real need to study that evidence, the Court finds that it was incumbent on the trial court in the situation at hand to ensure that the applicant company had a sufficiently long period of time during which it could study such a voluminous case file and prepare for the trial hearings and it was up to the applicant company to use this time as it wished. As regards the Government’s argument that the trial court was simply doing its best to comply with the two-month time-limit set out in Article 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure for examination of cases of this category, the Court is of the view that even though it is no doubt important to conduct proceedings at good speed, this should not be done at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the relatively short overall duration of the proceedings for a case of such magnitude and complexity."

It would take note of the fact that recently the domestic authorities themselves have found it necessary to modify and explain the provision in question by amending it (see paragraphs 422 and 423).

Despite the fact that the company may have had enough time to prepare for the cassation hearing, the cassation court, as a review court, had restricted competence in relation to the assessment of evidence already made by the first-instance and appeal courts (see paragraph 426) and, on the facts, it failed to recognize any shortcomings in the judgments of the lower courts (see paragraph 71 )."

In this respect, the Court observes that the immediate enforcement of the appeal decision did not prevent the company from lodging its cassation appeal and whilst Article 6 provides an applicant with the right of access to court, it does not guarantee, as such, the right to an automatic stay of enforcement of an unfavourable court decision. The Court would underline that the applicant company in the present case had access to courts of two levels of jurisdiction before any enforcement measures were taken and that the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 did not make it impossible for the applicant company to exercise its right to appeal in cassation, or to pursue further proceedings by way of supervisory review or before the Constitutional Court. The applicant company lodged its cassation appeal and additional submissions on the basis of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 on 7 July 2004 (see paragraph 67 ).

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ II). This means that the interference should be in compliance with the domestic law and that the law itself be of sufficient quality to enable an applicant to foresee the consequence of his or her conduct. As regards the compliance with the domestic law, the Court has limited power in this respect since it is a matter which primarily lies within the competence of the domestic courts (see Håkansson and Sturesson v.

France, 22 September 1994, § 42, Series A no. 296-A, and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, § 42, Series A no. 110).

Having initially refused to consider the applicant company’s individual complaint concerning the same issue (see paragraphs 76 and 77), the Constitutional Court accepted the reference from the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court and on 14 July 2005 gave a decision in which it disagreed with the lower courts (see paragraphs 82 -88), noting that the rules on the limitation period should apply in any event and that, exceptionally, if a taxpayer impeded the inspections by the tax authorities, and thereby delayed the adoption of the relevant decision, the running of the time-limit could be suspended by the adoption of a tax audit report setting out the circumstances of the tax offence in question and referring to the relevant articles of the Tax Code. Thereafter the case was referred back to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court which applied this interpretation to conclude that the applicant company had been actively impeding the tax inspections (see paragraphs 17 and 90 ). Since the audit report in respect of the year 2000 had been adopted and served on 29 December 2003, the court decided that the Ministry’s claims for 2000 had been brought on time. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court’s decision of 14 July 2005 resulted in a change in the interpretation of the relevant rules on the statutory time-limits of the proceedings. Accordingly, an issue arises as to whether such a change was compatible with the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In making its assessment the Court will take into account its previous finding that the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings were criminal in character (see OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya Yukos (dec.), cited above, § 453) and will also bear in mind that the change in question concerned the collection of fines for intentional evasion of tax. In this connection, it would again reiterate that the third rule of this Convention provision explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to pass “such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes” which means that the States are afforded an exceptionally wide margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Tre Traktörer AB v.

The Court reiterates the principle, contained primarily in Article 7 of the Convention but also implicitly in the notion of the rule of law and the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that only law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. While it prohibits, in particular, extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with appropriate legal assistance, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, §§ 145-146, ECHR)."

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV). The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30 and Kokkinakis v.

Even though the rule in itself did not describe the substantive elements of the offence and the applicable penalty, it nevertheless constituted a sine qua non condition with which the authorities had to comply in order to be able to prosecute the relevant taxpayers in connection with the alleged tax offences. Accordingly, Article 113 of the Tax Code defined a crime for the purposes of the Court’s analysis of lawfulness. It remains to be determined whether in the circumstances the decision of 14 July 2005 could be seen as a gradual clarification of the rules on criminal liability which “[was] consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 141)."

In its submissions on the merits of the case, the applicant company argued that “the Yukos Group”, including the trading companies, had operated as a unit and that the authorities had been aware of all the details of this unit’s functioning, including its relations with the trading companies, because all the entities forming the group made regular tax declarations. The company also submitted that the Ministry made regular checks of the whole group, involving the mapping of the entire course of every link in the chain of transactions from the original purchase of oil by the trading companies until its export, and that Yukos officials held monthly meetings with the Ministry’s officials to discuss the company’s functioning and tax returns.

As regards the attribution of tax liabilities, the applicant company considered that Russian law contained no provisions that permitted piercing of the corporate veil in order to hold one company liable for the actions of another, whether the latter was a subsidiary, an affiliate or a separate entity. The company claimed that the legal theories used by the Ministry in its tax assessment cases had been unprecedented and it referred to legal remedies that could have been used by the Ministry in this situation but had not been employed. In particular, the applicant company argued that the authorities should have applied the anti-transfer pricing mechanism of Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code or that the courts should have invalidated individual transactions by the trading companies so as to make either them or the applicant company’s subsidiaries liable for the allegedly underpaid tax. The applicant company considered that in any event, under the applicable domestic law, the authorities could not have held it directly liable for the actions of the trading companies. Furthermore, the company relied on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code to justify the unilateral transfers of cash from the trading companies to the applicant company’s Fund. It argued that there had been no such notion as “sham entity” in Russian law and that the “bad faith” doctrine had been too vague a legal tool to be used to prosecute it. The applicant company also submitted to the Court an opinion dated 7 September 2003 by the company’s counsel, the law firm “Pepelyev, Goltsblat i Partnery”, confirming the lawfulness of the arrangement whereby “a subsidiary company makes a transfer of its profits to the parent company, which in turn creates a Fund [out of these monies] to return them to the subsidiary companies for use ... or to pay the dividends” and also relied on case no A42-6604/00-15-818/01 to demonstrate that its tax arrangement had been lawful at domestic level. Lastly, the applicant company considered that the Government’s explanations in this connection and in particular its reference to Articles 168, 169 and 170 of the Civil Code could not justify the authorities’ actions in the tax assessment proceedings, since these provisions had not been relied upon by the domestic courts."

Both in its initial application to the Court and in further submissions on the admissibility of the case, the applicant company expressed dissatisfaction with the domestic courts’ refusal to recalculate the amount of the VAT due in the relevant Tax Assessment proceedings, purportedly as a result of the company’s failure to file for VAT refunds in its own name.

In their admissibility observations the Government stated that the tax inspections in respect of the applicant company had been conducted in accordance with the domestic law and that the company had been acting in bad faith throughout the proceedings, in blatant breach of tax legislation, and had merely been mimicking compliance with the law. In respect of the factual conclusions of the domestic courts, they argued that the applicant company had committed blatant tax evasion, as confirmed by the findings of the domestic courts. The evidence to confirm the Ministry’s claims was abundant and it was clear that the whole setup with trading companies was organised solely for the purpose of tax evasion. During the proceedings the applicant company had been unable to explain the economic reasons for the transactions in question. As an example of the sham nature of the arrangement, the Government referred to the fact, established by the domestic courts in the proceedings against the applicant company, that on one occasion a person managing one of the company’s sham entities signed three contracts simultaneously in three different locations, namely Samara, Nefteyugansk and the Tomsk region, situated at great distances from each other. In addition, the Government referred to an “internal” opinion by the audit company PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which specifically mentioned various problems with the applicant company’s “tax optimisation” scheme, including the Fund used by the company for receiving the money generated by the sham entities, and mentioned by the Appeal Court in its decision of 29 June 2004. This was in breach of the Russian legislation, as money could only be transferred from one independent commercial entity to another independent commercial entity in exchange or payment for services or goods (Article 575 of the Civil Code). In addition, the company misled the public in its reports and financial statements. For example, in February 2004 in its report for nine months of the year 2003 under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles standards, the company accounted for the difference between the nominal profit tax rate and the actual rate by its use of affiliate companies registered in foreign tax havens. This statement was not true since, as established by the domestic courts, the applicant company used sham entities located in domestic tax havens. The widespread use of promissory notes was also mentioned by the auditor as being non-compliant with the legislation in force. The Government submitted that the company’s management had used this opportunity to present a distorted picture of the company’s performance and thus attract investors."

In an interview with the Raschyot magazine of 30 January 2001, he stated that, as time passed, any widely replicated optimisation scheme became known to the tax authorities and they started fighting it. Penalties were being imposed with regard to low quality schemes, but the better quality schemes remained safe. The use of Russian low-tax regions was a crude form: where a company was registered in, for example, Kalmykiya, while the director, office and bank account were in Moscow. In such instances the court would rule that the location of the organisation was Moscow and not Kalmykiya. The scheme would be ruined and the company be forced to pay in Moscow. However, there could be more subtle schemes, where everything was arranged in such a way that the director, accountant and some staff were in Kalmykiya and there was an account in a Kalmyk bank, [and] thus the organisation would appear to have an actual presence there. Certainly, business would be conducted in Moscow but through another company, so that the entire profit went through appropriate contracts to Kalmykiya. Such subtle schemes were left untouched because formally there was nothing to pick on.

From the findings of the domestic courts and the parties’ explanations, the Court notes that the company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts. The Court observes that substantial tax reductions were only possible through the mixed use and simultaneous application of at least two different techniques. The applicant company used the method of transfer pricing, which consisted of selling the goods from its production division to its marketing companies at intentionally lowered prices and the use of sham entities registered in the domestic regions with low taxation levels and nominally owned and run by third persons (see paragraphs 14 - 18, 48, 62- 63 for a more detailed description)."

The domestic courts found that such an arrangement was at face value clearly unlawful domestically, as it involved the fraudulent registration of trading entities by the applicant company in the name of third persons and its corresponding failure to declare to the tax authorities its true relation to these companies (see paragraphs 311, 349-353, 374-380). This being so, the Court cannot accept the applicant company’s argument that the letter-box entities had been entitled to the tax exemptions in questions. For the same reason, the Court dismisses the applicant company’s argument that all the constituent members of the Yukos group had made regular tax declarations and had applied regularly for tax refunds and that the authorities were thus aware of the functioning of the arrangement. The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety on the sole basis on the tax declarations and requests for tax refunds made by the trading companies, the applicant company and its subsidiaries."

The arrangement was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices (see paragraphs 395-399), and by its nature involved certain operations, such as unilateral gifts between the trading companies and the applicant company through its subsidiaries, which were incompatible with the rules governing the relations between independent legal entities (see paragraph 376). In this connection, the Court finds relevant the warning given by the company’s auditor about the implications of the use of the company’s special fund during the year 2002 (see paragraphs 206 - 209 ) and is not persuaded by the applicant company’s reference to case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 (see paragraphs 356 - 357 ), the expert opinion of its counsel (see paragraph 577) and its reliance on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 376)."

A42-6604/00-15-818/01 was not alleged to have been part of a larger tax fraud and the Ministry failed to prove that it had been sham. The courts established that the entity had some assets, employees and a bank account at the place of its registration and dismissed the Ministry’s claims. As regards the expert opinion and the company’s reference to Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code, the Court finds them irrelevant as they refer to the relations of openly associated companies and not, as was the case at issue, to the use of sham entities fraudulently registered in the name of certain third parties. Thus, the Court cannot agree with the applicant company’s allegation that its particular way of “optimising tax” had been previously examined by the domestic courts and upheld as valid or that it had used lawful “tax optimisation techniques” which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts. The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the findings of the domestic courts that applicant company’s tax arrangements were unlawful at the time when the company had used them, were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable."

In this connection, the Court notes that in all the Tax Assessments (see paragraphs 14 - 18, 48, 62- 63, 165, 191-193, 212 and 213) the domestic courts essentially reasoned as follows. The courts established that the trading companies had been sham and had been entirely controlled by the applicant company and accordingly reclassified the transactions conducted by the sham entities as transactions conducted in reality by the applicant company."

                "596. The courts first decided that the transactions of the sham entities failed to meet the requirements of Article 39 of the Tax Code defining the notion of a sales operation (see paragraphs 48 and 324) as well as Article 209 of the Civil Code describing essential characteristics of an owner of goods (see paragraph 48 and 381). In view of the above and relying on Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code which established a refutable presumption of good faith and reasonableness of actions of the parties in commercial transactions (see paragraph 48 and 382-383), the courts then changed the characterisation of the sales operations of the sham entities. They decided that these were in reality conducted by the applicant company and that it had been incumbent on the latter to fulfil the corresponding obligation to pay various taxes on these activities. Finally, the courts noted that the setting up and running of the sham arrangement by the applicant company resulted in an understating of the taxable base of its operations and, as a consequence, the intentional non-payment of various taxes, which was punishable as a tax offence under Article 122 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 400)."

Having regard to the applicable domestic law, the Court finds that, contrary to the applicant company’s assertions, it is clear that under the then rules contractual arrangements made by the parties in commercial transactions were only valid in so far as the parties were acting in good faith and that the tax authorities had broad powers in verifying the character of the parties’ conduct and contesting the legal characterisation of such arrangements before the courts. This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time. Thus, Article 45 (2) 3 of the Tax Code explicitly provided the domestic courts with the power to change the legal characterisation of transactions and also the legal characterisation of the status and activity of the taxpayer, whilst section 7 of the Law on the Tax Authorities of the Russian Federation granted the right to contest such transactions to the tax authorities (see paragraph 393). In addition, the case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 (see paragraphs 382-393 and paragraphs 428-468). Moreover, in a number of its rulings, including decision of 25 July 2001 no. 138-0 specifically relied upon by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings against the applicant company (see paragraphs 384-387), the Constitutional Court confirmed the significance of this principle, having mentioned various possible consequences of a taxpayer’s bad faith conduct."

In so far as the applicant company complained that the bad faith doctrine had been too vague, the Court would again reiterate that in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation and there will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. In order to avoid excessive rigidity, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, among other authorities, Sunday Times, cited above, § 49 and Kokkinakis, cited above, § 40). On the facts, it would be impossible to expect from a statutory provision to describe in detail all possible ways in which a given taxpayer could abuse a legal system and defraud the tax authorities. At the same time, the applicable legal norms made it quite clear that, if uncovered, a taxpayer faced the risk of tax reassessment of its actual economic activity in the light of the relevant findings of the competent authorities. And this is precisely what happened to the applicant company in the case at hand."

On the facts, the former provision only applied to cases where the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax debt solely due to the seizure of its assets and cash funds (see paragraph 402 ). The domestic courts established that the company had been unable to pay because of the lack of funds and not because of the injunctions and refused to apply Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code in the applicant’s case (see paragraph 216). The Court does not find this conclusion arbitrary or unreasonable.

As regards the seizure of property, the Government referred to the Gasus Dosier and AGOSI cases and considered that, having regard to relevant factors, such as the enormous amount of arrears, the bad-faith conduct of the applicant company and the need for an expedient and efficient recovery of tax to the State budget, the measure in question was in compliance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Government submitted that both the seizure and freezing orders were usual practice, both domestically and internationally, and their use was especially appropriate in the present case because of the unprecedented amounts of the tax debts, the unrepentant and defiant attitude of the applicant company, claims that the authorities’ actions were a “malicious tax racket” and the applicant company’s history, namely its management and core shareholders moving corporate assets into new shell entities and sometimes into foreign tax havens. These measures were merely precautionary in character."

                "630. In respect of the April injunction, the Government disagreed with the applicant company’s claim that it could have repaid the debt but for the seizure of its assets. The injunction did not cover either cash or cash revenues and the applicant company did subsequently repay a portion of its debt using the cash in the frozen account. The applicant company could have had the injunction lifted had it provided adequate counter-security, which it failed to do, or liquidated some of its foreign assets not covered by the injunction. The Government maintained that instead of selling its foreign assets to meet its tax debts the applicant company simply stripped them away, which in itself proved that the company’s complaint about the injunction was unsubstantiated. As regards the freezing orders, the Government submitted that they had been issued by the bailiffs pursuant to court writs dated 30 June 2004, which froze the company’s accounts in Russian banks as of the date of issue of the respective freezing orders. The company could still dispose of cash added to its frozen accounts after 30 June 2004 and could use its non-seized accounts abroad. The funds in these accounts had been far lower than the company’s then liabilities. The Government further noted that as of 14 July 2004 the applicant company had still to pay 96.5% of its then liability and that the company’s voluntary payment only commenced on 14 July 2004, apparently as a response to the seizure of the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. The very fact that the payments had been made through the frozen accounts demonstrated that the company’s allegations about the effects of the cash freezing orders were untrue."

The Government pointed out that the Ministry of Finance had not been the proper authority to grant these measures as only a commercial court could and that the law set out clear rules regarding the conditions that should have been satisfied so that the request could be granted, i.e. the request should have been made one to six months before the original payment deadline and on specific grounds only, such as the risk of bankruptcy. In addition, the law did not allow for respite and payment spread if there were pending tax proceedings against the taxpayer at issue. The applicant not only failed to substantiate its request with reference to the criteria set out in law, but it was also clear that such a request was bound to fail because of the pending tax proceedings against the applicant company."

The Government relied on the applicable domestic law and cases to demonstrate that asking a guilty taxpayer to pay within one or two days had been standard and lawful practice followed in all cases. They claimed that this period was sufficient, as taxpayers usually learned about tax claims - with a specific indication of the sums to be paid - in the Ministry’s audit reports, which were usually served from several weeks to a few months in advance. Thus, in the present case the applicant company had first learned of the Ministry’s claims for the years 2000-2003 109, 66, 19 and 18 days in advance. More generally, in such cases the taxpayer usually knew well in advance the sums that had been underpaid (typically during tax evasion), so it cannot claim that it was unprepared. In addition, very similar practices existed internationally."

As to the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first item to be auctioned in satisfaction of the company’s liabilities, the Government pointed out that the offers made by the applicant company had been unacceptable. The first three offers, made on 22 April, 2 July and 13-14 July 2004, all involved various portions of shares of OAO Sibneft, allegedly owned by the applicant company. All three offers were rejected, not only because the company’s ownership of these shares had been contested in various unrelated proceedings by third persons, but also because the offers had been made in violation of injunctions issued by the courts in the above-mentioned unrelated proceedings. In fact, the sale of shares that did belong to the applicant company (some 20%) would have been insufficient to cover the company’s then debt, even in part, let alone satisfy the Ministry’s upcoming claims for the years 2001-2003. It was a minority stake of uncertain value and any such value was in any event insufficient to satisfy the company’s tax arrears. As regards the fourth offer, dated 9 August 2004, it involved 20% of OAO Sibneft and a farrago of shares in fifteen companies (some of them subsidiaries, some of them minority stakes and all of uncertain liquidity). In any event, this offer was “too little and too late” for the Government, since preparation for the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been under way. The above-mentioned “shopping list” did not offer any guarantee of a “good chance of fetching a price sufficient to discharge much of [the applicant’s] rapidly increasing tax liabilities” and in addition involved a high risk of third-party claims to the property in question in each case."

The Government maintained that the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz was lawful under Russian law, aimed at securing the payment of taxes and had been effected in full compliance with the provisions of the Federal Enforcement Proceedings Act. Under section 54 (2) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the sale of the applicant company’s property was made by a specialised organisation pursuant to the terms of commission and the relevant legislation. On 18 November 2004 the bailiffs decided to sell 43 shares (76.8%) of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction. The Government noted that OAO Yuganskneftegaz was itself the debtor in mandatory payments to the budget totalling RUB 102.09 billion, so that the above arrears inevitably affected the price of the auctioned shares, as defined by the valuation institution and the results of the auction. The date of the auction and invitation to participate in the open auction were published in the mass media in due time. The auction itself was open, both with regard to its participants and to the form of submissions of price bids. Bids were received between 19 November and 18 December 2004. On 19 December 2004 the open auction took place. The winner of the auction was recognised as OOO Baykalfinancegrup, which offered RUB 260,753,447,303.18 for the shares in question. The auction itself was public. The mass media representatives provided extensive media coverage. The results were published in the mass media and broadcast. With regard to the proportionality of the sale, the sum of 260.5 billion roubles generated as a result of the sale did not, however, cover the arrears of OAO Yukos entirely. The Government also underlined that the subsequent bankruptcy was not caused by the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, but had been initiated by a consortium of foreign banks and that the representatives of the applicant company had allegedly acknowledged that the company had been in good financial condition even despite the sale of OAO Yuganksneftegaz. In sum, the Government considered that there had been no breach of the Convention."

The Court would note, however, that given the circumstances of the applicant company’s tax case, its overall situation at the relevant time, the applicable domestic law and the courts’ responses to the arguments put forward by the applicant company in those proceedings, it is clear that both the attachment order of 15 April 2004 and the subsequent seizure orders of 1 and 14 July 2004 have been properly examined and confirmed by the domestic courts at various levels of jurisdictions and it does not appear that the applicant company’s complaints in this connection had any additional prospects of success, had the company not omitted the above-mentioned judicial instances."

In this connection, the Court would note that the applicant company clearly exhausted the available domestic remedies as regards the seizure and the subsequent measures leading to the eventual sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraphs 137 - 146 ), and it is also clear that the relevant domestic law specifically disallowed the courts to rearrange or otherwise postpone the repayment of the debt (see paragraphs 471-477) if there were, as in the case at hand, pending tax proceedings against the debtor.

Turning to the substance of the applicant company’s complaints, the Court notes that in April 2004, simultaneously with the Tax Assessment proceedings, the domestic authorities initiated enforcement proceedings aimed at securing their tax claims and later recovering the sums awarded by the courts as a result of the examination of these claims. They attached the company’s assets located in Russia and later partly froze the company’s domestic bank accounts and seized the shares of the applicant company’s Russian subsidiaries. On 20 July 2004 it was decided to auction off the company’s principal production subsidiary OAO Yuganskneftegaz, in satisfaction of the company’s tax liability, which at the time amounted to RUB 106.182 billion (some EUR 3.005 billion). As a result of the proceedings with regard to the Tax Assessments 2001 and 2002, the company’s debt to the tax authorities further increased and by the time the auction of OAO Yuganskneftegaz took place in December 2004 the company already owed the tax authorities some RUB 431.259 billion (some EUR 11.061 billion).

Though each of these measures could be seen as a separate instance of interference with the applicant company’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, their common and ultimate goal was to force the company to meet its tax liabilities. Accordingly, the appropriate way to analyse this part of the application is to examine the enforcement proceedings in their entirety as one continuous event. The Court further notes that the enforcement measures in question fall to be analysed under the third rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which allows the member States to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing “such laws as [they] deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties”. It follows that the Court’s task is to determine whether the State authorities complied with the Convention requirement of lawfulness and, if so, whether they struck a fair balance between the legitimate state interest in enforcing the tax debt in question and the protection of the applicant company’s rights set forth in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Likewise, the 7% enforcement fee was upheld by the domestic courts and cannot be said to have been selective, given the domestic case-law cited by the Government.

At the outset the Court notes the background to this case and, in particular, the fact that the applicant company was one of the largest taxpayers in Russia and that it had been suspected and subsequently found guilty of running a tax evasion scheme, committed consecutively in 2000-2003. From the parties’ submissions and the case file it seems clear that the applicant company had no cash funds in its domestic accounts to pay its tax debts immediately, and in view of the nature and scale of the debt it was unlikely that any third party would agree to assist the company with a loan or some form of security. Regard being had to the scale of the tax evasion, the sums involved for the years 2000-2003, the fact under domestic law that they were payable almost at once after the production of the respective execution writ (see paragraph 471), and even taking into account the Court’s previous findings in respect of the fines for the years 2000 and 2001, it was questionable whether at the time when the authorities decided to seize and auction OAO Yuganskneftegaz the company was at all solvent within the meaning of section 3 of the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act, which generally expected the solvent debtor to repay its debts “within three months of the date on which compliance should have occurred” (see paragraph 496)."

Given the paramount importance of the measures taken by the authorities to the applicant company’s future, and notwithstanding the Government’s wide margin of appreciation in this field, the Court is of the view that the authorities were obliged to take careful and explicit account of all relevant factors in the enforcement process. Such factors were to include, among other things, the character and the amount of the existing debt as well as of the pending and probable claims against the applicant company, the nature of the company’s business and the relative weight of the company in the domestic economy, the company’s current and probable economic situation and the assessment of its capacity to survive the enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, the economic and social implications of various enforcement options on the company and the various categories of stakeholders, the attitude of the company’s management and owners and the actual conduct of the applicant company during the enforcement proceedings, including the merits of the offers that the applicant company may have made in connection with the enforcement were to be properly considered."

In particular, neither the seizure order of 14 July 2004, which set in motion the process of auctioning OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraph 137 ), nor any of the subsequent decisions, including the judicial decisions in the context of the company’s complaints against the actions of the bailiffs (see paragraphs 137 - 158 ), mentioned or discussed in any detail possible alternative methods of enforcement and the consequences that they might have on the future of the company."

Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that, notwithstanding these constraints, the bailiffs still had a decisive freedom of choice, the exercise of which could either keep the company afloat or eventually lead to its demise. Although the Court, in principle, does not find the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz entirely unreasonable, especially in view of the overall amount of the tax-related debt and the pending as well as probable claims against the company, it is of the view that before definitively selecting for sale the asset that was the company’s only hope of survival, the authorities should have given very serious consideration to other options, especially those that could mitigate the damage to the applicant company’s structure. This was particularly so since all of the company’s domestic assets had been attached by previous court orders (see paragraph 27 ), and were readily available, the company itself did not seem to have objected to their sale (see paragraph 159) and there had been virtually no risk of the company seriously opposing these actions."

The applicant company was subjected to a 7% enforcement fee in connection with the entire amount of its tax-related liability, which constituted an additional hefty sum of over RUB 43 billion (EUR 1.16 billion), the payment of which could not be suspended or rescheduled (see paragraphs 484-486). This was a flat-rate fee which the authorities apparently refused to reduce, and these sums had to be paid even before the company could begin repaying the main body of the debt (see paragraph 484). The fee was by its nature unrelated to the actual amount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs. Whilst the Court may accept that there is nothing wrong as a matter of principle with requiring a debtor to pay for the expenses relating to the enforcement of a debt or to threaten a debtor with a sanction to incite his or her voluntary compliance with enforcement writs, in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs.

Despite the fact that it found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the speed with which the courts had conducted the proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case and a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the interference by the Constitutional Court with the outcome of the 2000 Tax Assessment case in the part relating to penalties, the Court rejected the applicant company’s claims that the company’s debt had been recognised as a result of an unforeseeable, unlawful and arbitrary interpretation of the domestic law (see paragraphs 605 and 616). The Court also recognised the right of the State to enforce, as such, the court judgments, but reached conclusions concerning the handling of the enforcement proceedings by the domestic authorities which lead to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In view of these findings, the Court will proceed on the assumption that the company’s debt in the enforcement proceedings resulted from legitimate actions by the respondent Government to counter the company’s tax evasion and the burden of proof would accordingly rest on the applicant company to substantiate its allegations."

As they had not been able to contest that charge, since it was not decided on until deliberations, the applicants had not had adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence.

As regards the extent to which they had been aware that an alternative verdict might be returned, the applicants stated that while it was true that aiding and abetting had been referred to at the investigation stage, it had subsequently been intentionally discounted by the investigating judge and disregarded by both the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal at the hearings.

Under that principle, a trial court had jurisdiction to hear the facts and was not bound by the legal characterisation set out in the summons or indictment. In the instant case, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal’s decision to convict of a separate offence in law had not altered the basis of the criminal charge, but simply constituted a different assessment of the degree to which the applicants had participated in the criminal bankruptcy offence.",
                "The Government contended that the notion of aiding and abetting, despite requiring three constitutive elements to be proved, was not really an autonomous one and was applied very flexibly by the courts. In particular, this was due to the difficulties that sometimes arose in distinguishing acts of aiding and abetting from acts committed jointly ( coaction ). The wording of former Article 60 of the Criminal Code, which had been in force at the material time, had contained deficiencies that the courts had sought to remedy through judicial interpretation in which aiding and abetting had on occasion been equated with acts committed jointly.",
                "Accordingly, aiding and abetting constituted an element that was intrinsic to the initial charge (see the De Salvador Torres v. Spain judgment of 24 October 1996, Reports 1996-V), especially as the offence the applicants were convicted of was among those mentioned in the order committing them for trial before the Criminal Court. The alternative verdict, which the applicants could have foreseen, had not fundamentally changed the nature of the accusation against them, involving as it did no more than a revised assessment of the degree of their participation.",

The fact that the investigating judge had not mentioned it in the committal order was not decisive for the purposes of Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention, as it had been referred to on at least one occasion during the course of the proceedings, and the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction in rem. Furthermore, as the additional submissions of the civil party, Chantiers Beneteau, had been lodged before the hearing of the appeal in the Court of Appeal, the applicants could easily have apprised themselves of them. The applicants, who acknowledged that the issue of aiding and abetting had been mentioned by Chantiers Beneteau’s counsel during his oral submissions, had, moreover, been assisted by experienced lawyers."

Austria judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, § 79). Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the cause of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts.

Although reference was made in the additional charges preferred on 4 and 16 December 1986 to provisions on both criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy (see paragraph 22 above) – without specific reasons being stated – the Court finds that the investigation conducted by the investigating judge was clearly confined to the offence of criminal bankruptcy. There is nothing to suggest that a charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy, to which counsel acting for Chantiers Beneteau referred in a letter to the investigating judge (see paragraph 21 above), was considered to be a genuine possibility during the investigation.",

Admittedly, the Court notes that Chantiers Beneteau lodged additional submissions with the registry on 2 April 1992, that is to say before the hearing in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 29 above). However, the Government have not provided any information to show that those submissions were effectively communicated to the applicants or their counsel when lodged with the registry or, indeed, subsequently.

The Court notes that the provisions of Articles 59 and 60 of the Criminal Code as applicable at the material time expressly provided that aiding and abetting could only be made out on proof of a number of special elements, subject to strict, cumulative conditions (see paragraph 36 above). Admittedly, aiding and abetting, by its nature, is related to the substantive offence committed by the principal. Acts of accessories only become criminal by reference to offences committed by the principal, which explains the notion of “related criminality” ( emprunt de criminalité ). However, in addition to this first constituent element, aiding and abetting also requires a factual element, that is to say the commission of one of the specific acts referred to in former Article 60 of the Criminal Code, and an element of intent: the awareness by the accessory that he was assisting in the commission of the offence (see paragraph 36 above)."

It is not for the Court to assess the merits of the defences the applicants could have relied on had they had an opportunity to make submissions on the charge of aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy. The Court merely notes that it is plausible to argue that the defence would have been different from the defence to the substantive charge. On a charge of aiding and abetting, Mr Pélissier and Mr Sassi would have had to persuade the court, firstly, that they had not committed any of the statutorily defined acts of aiding and abetting and, secondly, if they were accused of specific acts of aiding and abetting, that they had been unaware that they were assisting in the commission of an offence. Further, the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed means that it is not possible to avoid having to make out the specific elements of aiding and abetting (see paragraph 36 above). The Court notes, too, that the notion of joint offending ( coaction ) referred to by the Government, as indeed that of joint enterprise ( complicité corespective ), concern special situations unrelated to the present case. In the instant case, the Court confines itself to noting that both the Toulon Criminal Court and the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal expressly discounted the possibility that the applicants were principals or, therefore, joint principals.

It finds nothing in the instant case capable of explaining why, for example, the hearing was not adjourned for further argument or, alternatively, the applicants were not requested to submit written observations while the Court of Appeal was in deliberation.

In reply to the Government’s arguments, Mr Pélissier and Mr Sassi pointed out in particular that there had been only three companies involved (in what had been a normal commercial relationship), four defendants, four charges, and three civil parties who had intervened in the proceedings. They also stated that the oral submissions had been made over two hearings for reasons of convenience pertaining to the judges, not because the case was complex. They submitted that they could not be held responsible for the conduct of Fernand Cortez and that Mr Pélissier’s three weeks’ absence in July 1986 could not justify the investigation’s having taken six years. They argued that the judicial authorities had failed to discharge their obligation of diligence."

They maintained that the economic nature of the case, the fact that there were several defendants, the need to establish what the relationship between the defendants and their companies had been and the discovery of further offences had helped to make the proceedings complex. In addition, the Government contended that Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985 reforming insolvency law had created difficulties for the judicial authorities from the moment it came into force, though it had enabled the offence of criminal bankruptcy to be simplified. The Government also argued that by being slow to lodge requested observations or documents, Fernand Cortez had contributed to delays in the proceedings, as had Mr Pélissier, who had informed the investigating judge that he would be away from home from 2 to 24 July 1986. The Government asserted, lastly, that the judicial authorities had conducted the proceedings diligently throughout, apart from a period of inactivity between 3 August 1987 and 30 June 1988 when they had been awaiting a report from an accounting expert. As to the interval between appeals being lodged by the public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez on 22 March 1991 and the first hearing held by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 16 April 1992, the Government explained that there had been a large number of summonses to send to the various parties to the proceedings."

In particular, it considers that the economic nature of the offences did not, of itself, make the proceedings especially complex. Furthermore, the Court finds that, as the Government noted, the Law of 25 January 1985 simplified the offence of criminal bankruptcy, which ought to have made the investigating judge’s task that much easier. Lastly, the Court finds that the case involved only four defendants, connected with companies engaged in the same line of business, and that there was no evidence of the use of legal structures sophisticated enough to have impeded the investigators’ work to any great extent. Accordingly, the length of the proceedings cannot be justified by the complexity of the case."

In particular, the Court considers that in view of the length of the investigation, no criticism can properly attach to Mr Pélissier for his absence from 2 to 24 July 1986 (see paragraph 69 above), that is to say for less than a month during the judicial vacation. As regards the conduct of Fernand Cortez (see paragraph 69 above), for which, it is noted in passing, the applicants cannot be held responsible, the Government have not shown how it could be said to have been dilatory to the point of materially delaying the outcome of the investigation.",

Nor does the Court find persuasive the argument that the judges’ work had been made more difficult by the entry into force of the Law of 25 January 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), for, as the Government acknowledged (see paragraph 69 above), that statute had enabled the offence of criminal bankruptcy – the only one the applicants were accused of – to be simplified.",

                "By not laying down a time-limit for lodging a personal pleading - that is to say one that has not been drafted by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar – the Code of Criminal Procedure had prevented him from exercising his defence rights. His pleading had been received by the registry after his appeal on points of law had been dismissed and had therefore been disregarded as being out of time. Yet his lawyer had lodged it within a reasonable time, in this instance two and a half months after the notice of appeal had been filed. On the Government ’ s own admission, the average time for preparing for hearing an appeal on points of law in which the appellant was not represented by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar was three months. The Court of Cassation ’ s registry could remedy this statutory shortcoming by informing appellants who did not wish to be represented by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar of the date on which their appeal would be heard. It was not for convicted appellants to take steps to find out that date. Indeed, the legislature had been conscious of the perverse effects of this legal vacuum, because the new Article 585-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure now laid down a one-month time-limit (see paragraph 13 above).",
                "Furthermore, the French system for preparing criminal appeals on points of law for hearing created an inequality of treatment between those appellants who were represented by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar and those who were not. A member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar was given a time-limit that enabled him not only to protect himself from forfeiture of the right to proceed, but also to ensure that his written observations would in fact be considered by the reporting judge. Neither of those safeguards was provided in equivalent conditions to appellants who acted in person or were assisted by a member of the ordinary Bar.",
                "Lastly, there was inequality of arms between the defence and the prosecution. The procureur général at the Court of Cassation was personally advised of the progress of proceedings and of the hearing date, and at the hearing he could make observations without the appellant ’ s being permitted to reply."

The Court of Cassation was not therefore a third level of jurisdiction and special rules applied to criminal proceedings before it. The distinction made in the law between appellants who were represented by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar and those who were not was justified by the monopoly of representation in proceedings before the Conseil d ’ Etat and the Court of Cassation. Not imposing a time-limit on unrepresented appellants for filing pleadings gave an advantage to appellants who were not legal practitioners and who consequently were given more time than members of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar to prepare their case. However, even though unrepresented appellants had more time, they should not remain inactive. On the contrary, they had to be vigilant as, under Article 604, first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court of Cassation was entitled to rule on the appeal once ten days had elapsed after the registry had received the case file. The 1993 reform was designed to ensure equality between all appellants.",
                "Mr Vacher had deliberately chosen not to be assisted by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. He should, consequently, have shown a minimum of diligence. In the present case the time available to him to draft his pleading - more than two months (28 May 1991 - 6 August 1991 ) - should have allowed him to prepare his case. Furthermore, he had been assisted by counsel who, though not a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, could not legitimately plead his ignorance of current practice in order to complain that the procedure was unfair. He should have taken advice from colleagues who specialised in Court of Cassation cases and taken one of the following steps: asked the Court of Cassation ’ s registry when the Court of Appeal had forwarded the case file, that being when the ten-day period laid down in Article 604 of the Code of Criminal Procedure began to run; informed the reporting judge of his client ’ s intention to file a pleading and applied to that judge for the case not to be listed for imminent hearing; or found out when the appeal was to be heard. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer had made use of the means available to them for ensuring that they actually enjoyed the rights protected by Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6). In their neglect, identical to that which the Court had found in respect of Mr Melin (see the Melin v. France judgment of 22 June 1993, Series A no. 261-A), they had betrayed a distinct lack of interest in the outcome of the proceedings.",

In view of the special nature of appeals to the Court of Cassation, only the judgment appealed against was being impugned, irrespective of the appellant ’ s status. Far from acting as the prosecution, the role of the procureur général ’ s office at the Court of Cassation was that of an adviser on the law, providing the court with a legal view of the case in the same way as the reporting judge.",
                "Lastly, procedure before the Court of Cassation was essentially written, oral submissions being rare. In that respect there was no objective difference between appellants represented by a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat and Court of Cassation Bar and those who were not."

Firstly, in the Melin case there was a gap of four months and ten days (17 January 1986 - 27 May 1986) between the lodging of the appeal on points of law and its dismissal and no pleading was received by the registry, whereas in the instant case the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal two months and nine days after it was lodged (28 May 1991 - 6 August 1991) and the pleading was filed on 14 August 1991, two and a half months after the appeal was lodged.

The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will get a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 and 67, Series A no. 211; Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 262; mutatis mutandis, Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, §§ 41-45, 3 March 2000). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, § 53, Commission’s report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, and Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 220, 9 October 2008).

There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company, its oil-processing and oil-producing subsidiaries and the trading entities, and the company’s own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead. All the money thus accumulated from sales was then transferred unilaterally to the “Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS”, a commercial entity founded, owned and run by the applicant company.

                "Entities registered in the Trekhgornyy ZATO in the Chelyabinsk Region (OOO Kverkus ..., OOO Muskron ..., OOO Nortex ..., OOO Greis ... and OOO Virtus ...) concluded tax agreements with the administration of the town of Trekhgornyy, according to which entities were granted advantages in respect of profit tax, tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities, property tax, land tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users’ tax, tax on vehicle users, and tax on the acquisition of vehicles, provided that the entities remitted the sum of 5% of the total amount of tax advantages conferred, for implementation of the town’s socio-economic programmes, to the Trekhgornyy administration... Reasoning from the contents and meaning of the tax agreements, it follows that their purpose was implementation of the particularly important socio-economic task of developing the educational, medical and housing spheres in the Trekhgornyy ZATO. At the same time, the sums which were transferred to the budget by the taxpayers in question were many times lower than the sums of the declared tax advantages (the sum of investments is around 0.006% of the sum of the advantages for each taxpayer). Thus, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of Trekhgornyy’s economy. On the contrary, since the above-mentioned organisations did not in fact carry out any activities, were never located on the territory of Trekhgornyy, had no assets and none of the production facilities necessary to buy and store oil on the territory of Trekhgornyy, the application of tax advantages by the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’.",

[However], the amounts received from the taxpayers are many times lower than the totals of the declared tax advantages. Accordingly, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of the economy of the town of Lesnoy because the above-mentioned organisations never carried out any activities on the territory of Lesnoy, were never in fact located on the territory of Lesnoy and had no assets and none of the production facilities required to sell and store oil on the territory of Lesnoy, [and thus] the application of the tax advantages in respect of the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 ‘On closed administrative territorial formations’.",

The mentioned organisation was registered in the given district solely for the purpose of acquiring the right to the tax concession that could be granted in the Evenk Autonomous District. The use of the tax benefits by the organisation in question is not aimed at strengthening of economy of the Evenk Autonomous District, but is instead aimed at tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of extraction and processing transactions and the sale of oil and oil products and is thus unlawful.",

As regards the argument that the Ministry’s calculations were erroneous in that they led to double taxation and the failure to take account of the right to a refund of VAT for export operations, the court noted that, contrary to the applicant company’s allegations, both the revenues and expenses of the sham entities had been taken into account by the Ministry so as to avoid double taxation. In addition, under Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 “On value-added tax”, in order to claim a refund of the VAT paid during export operations a taxpayer had to justify the claim in accordance with a special procedure and the applicant company had failed to apply for a refund either in 2000 or at any later date. As to the argument that the Ministry’s claim was time-barred, the court refuted it with reference to Article 113 of the Tax Code and Decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 21 July 2001. The court held that the rules on limitation periods were inapplicable in the case at issue as the applicant company had acted in bad faith. In response to the company’s argument that the interdependency within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code was only relevant for the purposes of price correction under Article 40 of the Code, the court observed that the interdependency of the sham companies and the applicant company was one of the circumstances on the basis of which the tax authorities had proved that the tax offence had been committed by the applicant company in bad faith."

The company further claimed that the above ruling was applicable to the case at issue, that OAO Yuganskneftegas was a major production unit and that the bailiffs had produced no evidence that the assets and goods and other values not involved in the production process were insufficient.

They argued that, under the applicable domestic law, the seizure should be made first in respect of the cash-flow and then, under section 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings, it would be open to the bailiffs to assess and seize the assets depending on their liquidity. They countered the applicant company’s arguments by saying that the latter’s references were invalid in that they related to the other stage of enforcement proceedings (the collection of debt and not the seizure as such). Furthermore, they argued that Ruling no. 4 of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable since, in the case of Yuganskneftegas, the State had transferred only 38% of the shares and not a controlling block. With regard to the offer of Sibneft stock, the Ministry and bailiffs argued that the applicant company’s rights in respect of these shares had been contested in separate sets of court proceedings and it was therefore risky to accept them as a payment. Lastly, they informed the court that the applicant company had recently hidden the shareholder registers of its three major subsidiaries, OAO Yuganskneftegas, OAO Samaraneftegas and OAO Tomskneft, which, in their view, demonstrated the risk of possible asset-stripping by the applicant company."

For the remaining 75% of the voting stock, the 38% transferred by the State constituted the controlling block. As regards the offer of shares in Sibneft, the court noted that the exact quantity of the contested shares was unclear and that the bailiffs should find out the exact figures and that they should consider the uncontested shares as a possible means of partial settlement.

Some of the company’s foreign minority shareholders also initiated similar proceedings under bilateral investment treaties. The Court notes, however, that despite certain similarities in the subject-matters of the present case and of the arbitration proceedings, the claimants in those arbitration proceedings are the applicant company’s shareholders acting as investors, and not the applicant company itself, which at that moment in time was still an independent legal entity."

The Court reiterates that in November 2007 the applicant company was liquidated and that despite this fact in its admissibility decision of 29 January 2009 it nevertheless accepted the application “because the issues raised by the case transcend[ed] the person and the interests of the applicant [company]” and “... striking the application out of the list under such circumstances would undermine the very essence of the right of individual applications by legal persons, as it would encourage governments to deprive such entities of the possibility to pursue an application lodged at a time when they enjoyed legal personality...”, which shows that the Court has throughout placed emphasis on the applicant company in its own right."

As regards the first instance proceedings, at the admissibility stage of proceedings before this Court the applicant company argued that the supporting material underlying the Tax Assessment for 2000 had first been provided to it as a result of the City Court’s decision of 14 May 2004. It alleged that the disclosure did not occur until 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed 24,000 pages of documents, and continued on 18 May 2004 with approximately 45,000 further pages and a further 2,000 pages late on 20 May 2004, i.e. on the eve of the first-instance hearing. The company conceded that its representatives had indeed been given access to all these materials, both prior to the hearings and during the trial, but submitted that the manner and time for such access had been so unsatisfactory that it was of no practical use. It also argued that it had been unable effectively to access the court’s filed documents during the first-instance hearings except during the lunch breaks. Overall, the company insisted that it had had insufficient time to prepare its defence and familiarise itself with the evidence before the court and that it had not had an opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on all of the evidence adduced or observations filed, nor to express its views on every document in the file, contrary to Article 6. It referred to the Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain and Krčmář v. Czech Republic cases. In their post-admissibility observations the company submitted that the Ministry had had sufficient time to disclose the evidence, as the relevant documents had been in the possession of the Ministry and that the Ministry could have disclosed them at any point from 8 December 2003 (some six months before the beginning of the hearing). It further noted that the documents filed by the Ministry had been in complete disorder and had been stored in nineteen plastic crates (ten of them containing six thousand pages each and nine more containing some four thousand pages each) and simply could not be studied properly over such a short period. The documents were kept in a room measuring three to four square metres and containing two chairs, a desk and one window. A request for additional space had been turned down. The above-mentioned conditions were reflected in a record dated 18 May 2004, drawn up by the applicant company’s counsel. The Ministry’s representative had refused to sign it and stated that he disagreed with its contents. More generally, the applicant company criticised the Ministry for bringing an action against it before the expiry of the grace period and argued that the first instance proceedings had been unfair because its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings and that it was under the impression that the first-instance court had pronounced judgment without having studied all the evidence."

            [
                "530. As regards the appeal proceedings, the applicant company also insisted on the breach of Article 6. It submitted that the domestic courts had failed to address the question of whether the abridgement of time had affected its substantive right to a fair hearing and that, equally, it did not rely on Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, referred to by the respondent Government. Also, the rule in Article 267 requiring an appeal to be determined within one month is not respected in practice by the Russian courts; failure to comply with this requirement, even for a whole year, has no consequences for the proceedings. There was, according to the applicant company, no evidence of any particular urgency in listing or resolving the appeal: neither the Ministry, nor the co-appellant, OOO ‘YUKOS’ Moscow, sought expedition when their appeals were lodged and the co-appellant did not oppose the applicant company’s applications to adjourn the appeal hearing. In response to the Government’s criticism suggesting that the company’s appeal was misaddressed by the omission of part of the postal code from the envelope, the applicant stated that no evidence had been provided of any mistake in this respect and that, after all, the appeal had been received by the court and the tax authorities. In any event, the court had made no criticism of the company in relation to the exercise of this appeal. Overall, the abridgement of the appeal period was a serious interference with the company’s right to prepare for the appeal hearings, which failed to cure but rather accentuated the unfairness of the first-instance proceedings, and no substantive reason has been offered as to why this acceleration was lawful, necessary or consistent with the requirements of a fair trial."

The applicant company submitted in respect of the complaint about the delay in the delivery of the appeal judgment that the delay meant that the decision had been immediately enforced against the company, rendering any further cassation appeal nugatory. Only an application for a stay of enforcement pending an appeal in cassation, coupled with a valid appeal in cassation, could have been effective against the enforcement. In the company’s view, such a valid appeal was strictly dependent on filing of the reasons by the appeal court. The appeal decision had become subject to immediate forcible execution, the company had become liable for an additional surcharge of 7% of the total liability and the opportunity to exercise an effective appeal against these measures had been circumvented.",

                "532. As regards the argument that the company had insufficient time for preparation of the defence, the Government referred in their admissibility observations to the domestic legislation, which established a two-month time-limit for the examination of the case at first instance (Article 134 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure). The applicant company had at least 37 days to prepare its defence from the date of the filing of the suit, which, in view of the above time-limit, had not been unreasonable. Furthermore, the applicant company first became aware of the Ministry’s arguments on 29 December 2003, when the Ministry issued the report indicating the applicant company’s large tax liability and by 12 January 2004 the company had also filed its objections to the report under Article 100 (5) of the Tax Code. Moreover, the principal arguments contained in these objections remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. It could not be said therefore that the applicant company was unprepared to state its case, since it was well aware of the Ministry’s arguments five months prior to the beginning of the court proceedings. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant company’s lawyers were given an opportunity to study the evidence both in court and at the Ministry’s premises throughout May, June and July 2004. According to the documents submitted by the Government, counsel for the applicant company availed themselves of this opportunity at least on two occasions, on 18 and 19 May 2004 respectively. Lastly, the Government argued that the applicant company’s arguments about insufficient time for the preparation of the case had been carefully examined and eventually dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. In their post-admissibility observations the Government also submitted that the proceedings before commercial courts in Russia were generally conducted without serious delays (referring, for instance, to the lack of any cases against Russia on account of length of proceedings before the commercial courts). They further argued that in its submissions the applicant company had asserted generalities and had never mentioned any specific documents to which they had not had proper access. The evidence in question had been documents which were well known to the applicant company, as the Ministry had requested these documents from it during the on-site inspection (the Government relied on Article 101 (2) 4 of the Tax Code in this respect) and that the documents had been itemised in a register dated 17 May 2004 no. 14-3-02/22-13-1 and had been copies of original documentation reflecting the relations between the applicant company and its sham entities. In addition, the Government argued that any number of the company’s lawyers could have come to study the evidence and that the applicant company had apparently felt no need to do so, since it had been represented by eight lawyers in the first-instance proceedings and only two to four of them had studied the documents. Overall, the Government suggested that the dispute was more legal rather than factual, so that the crux of the applicant company’s objections concerned the interpretation of the domestic law rather than controversy about the particular circumstances of the tax evasion. In addition, the Government argued that the appeal hearing constituted a de novo examination of the case and that by then the applicant company had had a perfectly adequate opportunity to review the documentary record. By asking to adjourn the proceedings the applicant merely intended to delay the delivery of the judgment."

            [
                "533. As regards the appeal proceedings, in the Government’s view they too were in compliance with Article 6. The applicant company had brought appeal proceedings against the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004: the possibility of review on both points of fact and law had been expressly provided for by Russian law (Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure) and the company had used it. Under Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, which requires an appeal court to examine the appeals by the parties within a month of the date on which they were filed, the Appeal Court had to examine the case within a month of 1 June 2004, which was the date on which one party to the case, OOO ‘YUKOS’ Moskva, first lodged an appeal brief, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant company lodged its appeal on 17 June 2004. The appeal hearings, which represented a full re-trial of the case within the meaning of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, started on 18 June and lasted eight days, that is, until 29 June 2004, which was in line with the above rule. In addition, the applicant company deliberately delayed the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address. Lastly, the Government underlined that the appeal decision had not been final and had been appealed against by the applicant company both in cassation instance and by way of supervisory review. The Government submitted that the fact that the reasoned copy of the Appeal Court decision of 29 June 2004 had been produced on 9 July 2004 did not affect the fairness of the proceedings as, in any event, it was open to the applicant company to lodge its cassation appeal within a two-month time-limit from the date of delivery of the appeal decision on 29 June 2004, even in the absence of the reasoned copy of the decision. The applicant company had lodged its cassation appeal on 6 July 2004 in the absence of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision. The cassation appeal was accepted for consideration and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court."

The Court recalls the the Ministry’s action was lodged under the rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute was insoluble and, regard being had to the circumstances of the case, finds no indication of arbitrariness or unfairness within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention in this connection.",

The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will get a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 and 67, Series A no. 211; Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 262; mutatis mutandis, Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, §§ 41-45, 3 March 2000). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, § 53, Commission’s report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, and Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 220, 9 October 2008). The facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997, and Galstyan v.

Turning to the case at hand, the Court observes that the Ministry’s claims to the applicant company in respect of the year 2000 were based on the audit report of 29 December 2003, which became available to the applicant company on the same date and was later used in the decision of 14 April 2004, served on the applicant on 15 April 2004. It is true that these two documents were very detailed, and contained the attachments to substantiate the Ministry’s position, and that the applicant company had on a few occasions opportunity to contest them. The fact remains, however, that the object of the trial court’s examination during the hearings of 21 to 26 May 2004 was neither the audit report of 29 December 2003 and the decision of 14 April 2004 as such, nor the copies of the documents allegedly already in possession of the applicant company, but rather the Ministry’s court claims based on the above-mentioned two documents and the additional body of evidence filed by the Ministry and comprising at least 43,000 pages. It is clear to the Court that in order to provide the applicant company with an adversarial trial and “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [its] defence” the applicant company should have been given an adequate opportunity to study the entirety of these documents and, more generally, to prepare for the hearings of the merits of the case on reasonable terms."

As regards the Government’s reference to the applicant company’s conduct during the proceedings and its argument that the company had no real need to study that evidence, the Court finds that it was incumbent on the trial court in the situation at hand to ensure that the applicant company had a sufficiently long period of time during which it could study such a voluminous case file and prepare for the trial hearings and it was up to the applicant company to use this time as it wished. As regards the Government’s argument that the trial court was simply doing its best to comply with the two-month time-limit set out in Article 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure for examination of cases of this category, the Court is of the view that even though it is no doubt important to conduct proceedings at good speed, this should not be done at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the relatively short overall duration of the proceedings for a case of such magnitude and complexity."

In so far as the applicant company also complained about the alleged delay in providing the reasons for the Appeal Court’s judgment in the proceedings in respect of the 2000 Tax Assessment, the Court would note that the applicant company did not complain about the proceedings in cassation as such but rather claimed that, in its situation, effective access to the cassation court was impossible without a stay of enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004. In this respect, the Court observes that the immediate enforcement of the appeal decision did not prevent the company from lodging its cassation appeal and whilst Article 6 provides an applicant with the right of access to court, it does not guarantee, as such, the right to an automatic stay of enforcement of an unfavourable court decision. The Court would underline that the applicant company in the present case had access to courts of two levels of jurisdiction before any enforcement measures were taken and that the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 did not make it impossible for the applicant company to exercise its right to appeal in cassation, or to pursue further proceedings by way of supervisory review or before the Constitutional Court. The applicant company lodged its cassation appeal and additional submissions on the basis of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 on 7 July 2004 (see paragraph 67 ). The appeal was accepted for consideration, and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court (see paragraph 70 ). Not only the cassation appeal, but also the request to stay the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 were examined by the domestic courts at two instances and eventually dismissed as unfounded (see paragraphs 127 - 129 )."

The Court finds that the overall effect of these difficulties, taken as a whole, so restricted the rights of the defence that the principle of a fair trial, as set out in Article 6, was contravened.

The Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second paragraph recognises that the States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws” (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ II). This means that the interference should be in compliance with the domestic law and that the law itself be of sufficient quality to enable an applicant to foresee the consequence of his or her conduct. As regards the compliance with the domestic law, the Court has limited power in this respect since it is a matter which primarily lies within the competence of the domestic courts (see Håkansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 47, Series A no. 171 ‑ A, and, mutatis mutandis, Tre Traktörer AB v. Sweden, 7 July 1989, § 58, Series A no. 159). As regards the quality of the law, the Court’s task is to verify whether the applicable provisions of domestic law were sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable (see Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, § 42, Series A no. 296-A, and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, § 42, Series A no. 110). In so far as the tax sphere is concerned, the Court’s well-established position is that States may be afforded some degree of additional deference and latitude in the exercise of their fiscal functions under the lawfulness test (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23 October 1997, §§ 75-83, Reports 1997 ‑ VII) and that, in view of the complexity of the relevant field of regulation, corporate entities, as opposed to individual taxpayers, may be required to act with additional caution and diligence by consulting competent specialists in this sphere (see Špaček, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 59, 9 November 1999)."

According to the practice directions of the Supreme Commercial [7] Court dated 28 February 2001, the moment at which a taxpayer was held liable within the meaning of Article 113 of the Tax Code was the date of the relevant decision of the tax authority (see paragraph 405 and 406)."

Thereafter the supervisory review instance decided that such an interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-limits had not been in line with the existing legislation and case-law (see paragraph 80 ) and referred the issue to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court, which, in turn, referred it to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 81 )."

Thereafter the case was referred back to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court which applied this interpretation to conclude that the applicant company had been actively impeding the tax inspections (see paragraphs 17 and 90 ). Since the audit report in respect of the year 2000 had been adopted and served on 29 December 2003, the court decided that the Ministry’s claims for 2000 had been brought on time. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court’s decision of 14 July 2005 resulted in a change in the interpretation of the relevant rules on the statutory time-limits of the proceedings.

In this connection, it would again reiterate that the third rule of this Convention provision explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to pass “such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes” which means that the States are afforded an exceptionally wide margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Tre Traktörer AB v.

While it prohibits, in particular, extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with appropriate legal assistance, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, §§ 145-146, ECHR)."

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV). The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30 and Kokkinakis v.

As regards the attribution of tax liabilities, the applicant company considered that Russian law contained no provisions that permitted piercing of the corporate veil in order to hold one company liable for the actions of another, whether the latter was a subsidiary, an affiliate or a separate entity. The company claimed that the legal theories used by the Ministry in its tax assessment cases had been unprecedented and it referred to legal remedies that could have been used by the Ministry in this situation but had not been employed. In particular, the applicant company argued that the authorities should have applied the anti-transfer pricing mechanism of Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code or that the courts should have invalidated individual transactions by the trading companies so as to make either them or the applicant company’s subsidiaries liable for the allegedly underpaid tax. The applicant company considered that in any event, under the applicable domestic law, the authorities could not have held it directly liable for the actions of the trading companies. Furthermore, the company relied on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code to justify the unilateral transfers of cash from the trading companies to the applicant company’s Fund. It argued that there had been no such notion as “sham entity” in Russian law and that the “bad faith” doctrine had been too vague a legal tool to be used to prosecute it. The applicant company also submitted to the Court an opinion dated 7 September 2003 by the company’s counsel, the law firm “Pepelyev, Goltsblat i Partnery”, confirming the lawfulness of the arrangement whereby “a subsidiary company makes a transfer of its profits to the parent company, which in turn creates a Fund [out of these monies] to return them to the subsidiary companies for use ... or to pay the dividends” and also relied on case no A42-6604/00-15-818/01 to demonstrate that its tax arrangement had been lawful at domestic level. Lastly, the applicant company considered that the Government’s explanations in this connection and in particular its reference to Articles 168, 169 and 170 of the Civil Code could not justify the authorities’ actions in the tax assessment proceedings, since these provisions had not been relied upon by the domestic courts."

The applicant argued that the Ministry had known about all of the trading companies’ transactions because of their monthly VAT returns and regular requests for tax refunds, and that since all of the traded oil had been for export and exempt from VAT its use of tax arrangements with the trading companies had not achieved any savings in this connection. Both in its initial application to the Court and in further submissions on the admissibility of the case, the applicant company expressed dissatisfaction with the domestic courts’ refusal to recalculate the amount of the VAT due in the relevant Tax Assessment proceedings, purportedly as a result of the company’s failure to file for VAT refunds in its own name. In its final submissions to the Court at the hearing on 4 March 2010, the company alleged that on 31 August 2004 it had filed the VAT exemption forms in its own name for each of the years 2000 to 2003. In addition, with reference to Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code, the applicant company claimed that it should not have been ordered to pay interest surcharges at all.",

                "579. In their admissibility observations the Government stated that the tax inspections in respect of the applicant company had been conducted in accordance with the domestic law and that the company had been acting in bad faith throughout the proceedings, in blatant breach of tax legislation, and had merely been mimicking compliance with the law. In respect of the factual conclusions of the domestic courts, they argued that the applicant company had committed blatant tax evasion, as confirmed by the findings of the domestic courts. The evidence to confirm the Ministry’s claims was abundant and it was clear that the whole setup with trading companies was organised solely for the purpose of tax evasion. During the proceedings the applicant company had been unable to explain the economic reasons for the transactions in question. As an example of the sham nature of the arrangement, the Government referred to the fact, established by the domestic courts in the proceedings against the applicant company, that on one occasion a person managing one of the company’s sham entities signed three contracts simultaneously in three different locations, namely Samara, Nefteyugansk and the Tomsk region, situated at great distances from each other. In addition, the Government referred to an “internal” opinion by the audit company PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which specifically mentioned various problems with the applicant company’s “tax optimisation” scheme, including the Fund used by the company for receiving the money generated by the sham entities, and mentioned by the Appeal Court in its decision of 29 June 2004. This was in breach of the Russian legislation, as money could only be transferred from one independent commercial entity to another independent commercial entity in exchange or payment for services or goods (Article 575 of the Civil Code). In addition, the company misled the public in its reports and financial statements. For example, in February 2004 in its report for nine months of the year 2003 under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles standards, the company accounted for the difference between the nominal profit tax rate and the actual rate by its use of affiliate companies registered in foreign tax havens. This statement was not true since, as established by the domestic courts, the applicant company used sham entities located in domestic tax havens. The widespread use of promissory notes was also mentioned by the auditor as being non-compliant with the legislation in force. The Government submitted that the company’s management had used this opportunity to present a distorted picture of the company’s performance and thus attract investors."

As regards the lawfulness of the company’s use of domestic tax havens, the Government referred to statements by a senior partner in the law firm “Pepelyaev, Goltsblat i Partnery”, which advised the applicant company and its majority shareholder, Group Menatep. In an interview with the Raschyot magazine of 30 January 2001, he stated that, as time passed, any widely replicated optimisation scheme became known to the tax authorities and they started fighting it. Penalties were being imposed with regard to low quality schemes, but the better quality schemes remained safe. The use of Russian low-tax regions was a crude form: where a company was registered in, for example, Kalmykiya, while the director, office and bank account were in Moscow. In such instances the court would rule that the location of the organisation was Moscow and not Kalmykiya. The scheme would be ruined and the company be forced to pay in Moscow. However, there could be more subtle schemes, where everything was arranged in such a way that the director, accountant and some staff were in Kalmykiya and there was an account in a Kalmyk bank, [and] thus the organisation would appear to have an actual presence there. Certainly, business would be conducted in Moscow but through another company, so that the entire profit went through appropriate contracts to Kalmykiya. Such subtle schemes were left untouched because formally there was nothing to pick on. According to the Government, the applicant company used the schemes described in their crudest form and undoubtedly knew that such schemes were illegal."

In their post-admissibility observations, the Government submitted that the company’s tax arrangement, consisting of the systemic use of dozens of shell entities which were controlled by the applicant company, organised in special low-tax zones within Russia, transfers of profits from the shell entities to the applicant company and multiple layers of trading activities between the company’s production units and the ultimate customer, had been clearly unlawful and had one and only one aim – to avoid payment of taxes. The applicant company tried to hide its involvement in this scheme by renaming the shell entities on a regular basis and by operating through a complex system of promissory notes’ exchanges aimed at hiding the transfers of profits from the shell entities to the company. The whole setup had been managed by the applicant company, although on paper the shell entities had been owned and managed by third parties."

In all of these cases, exactly the same method as that used by the authorities in the applicant company’s case had been used – i.e. the courts had looked behind appearances and taken account of the substance of the transactions in question. As regards the bad-faith theory, the Government relied on two decisions of the Constitutional Court, nos. 138-O and 168-O, dated 25 July 2001 and 8 April 2004 respectively, and the case-law of the commercial courts.

They also referred to rules in the UK and France to show that these countries used essentially the same approach in respect of VAT refunds. More generally, the Government also argued that the refusal to grant VAT repayment was a direct consequence of the company’s own recklessness in operating its tax optimisation plans and that it had failed to make any attempts to comply with the legal requirements for VAT refunds even after the tax fraud had been exposed. The Government submitted that the applicant company had never made any applications for VAT refunds in its own name."

The authorities could not be accused of having tolerated the company’s tax optimisation, as they could not have had any prior knowledge of it on account of its complex and well-masked character. They also argued that the present case had a moral and social dimension, in the sense that the applicant company had been one of the biggest taxpayers in Russia, that many social programmes run by the State had depended on the company’s tax payments, that the company’s resources had been transferred to it during privatisation in exchange for their efficient and honest use, and that the colossal scope of the tax evasion had led to an incorrect redistribution of wealth and the denial of their social responsibility by a small number of the company’s core shareholders. The Government also insisted that the Court take into account the wide margin of appreciation which is mentioned in the Convention and recognised by the Convention case-law in any assessment of the company’s complaints. They disagreed with the applicant company’s argument regarding expropriation, as the Government viewed the events referred to by the applicant company as a mere enforcement of tax laws.

The Court notes that in this complaint the applicant company challenged the lawfulness of the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 only in the part linked to the payment of reassessed taxes. The examination will therefore be confined to the question of the lawfulness of the additional tax liability. The Court further notes that the company did not seem to dispute that the relevant laws made it clear what taxes were due, at what rate and when. Rather, the company claimed that in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 it used lawful “tax optimisation techniques” which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts in 2004, 2005 and 2006. It also complained that any existing legal basis for finding the company liable fell short of the Convention requirements in respect of the quality of the law and that, in any event, the application of the relevant laws contradicted established practice. Accordingly, the Court has to determine whether the relevant tax arrangements were domestically lawful at the time when the relevant transactions took place and whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable."

Turning to the first question, the Court would note at the outset that the applicant company disputed the findings of the domestic courts concerning the nature of relations between the applicant company and its trading entities. In view of its conclusion that the tax assessment proceedings in respect of the year 2000 did not comply with the requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention, the Court is required to decide whether the factual assessments made by the domestic courts could be used for the purposes of its legal analysis under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this respect, the Court reiterates that according to its well-established case-law it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts, which are in the best position to assess the evidence before them and establish the facts. The Court will not, in principle, intervene, unless the decisions reached by the domestic courts appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, Ravnsborg v.

The factual issues in all of these proceedings were substantially similar and the relevant case files contained abundant witness statements and documentary evidence to support the connections between the applicant company and its trading companies and to prove the sham nature of the latter entities (see paragraphs 14 - 18, 48, 62- 63, 165, 191-193, 212 and 213).

                "591. From the findings of the domestic courts and the parties’ explanations, the Court notes that the company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts. The Court observes that substantial tax reductions were only possible through the mixed use and simultaneous application of at least two different techniques. The applicant company used the method of transfer pricing, which consisted of selling the goods from its production division to its marketing companies at intentionally lowered prices and the use of sham entities registered in the domestic regions with low taxation levels and nominally owned and run by third persons (see paragraphs 14 - 18, 48, 62- 63 for a more detailed description)."

                "592. The domestic courts found that such an arrangement was at face value clearly unlawful domestically, as it involved the fraudulent registration of trading entities by the applicant company in the name of third persons and its corresponding failure to declare to the tax authorities its true relation to these companies (see paragraphs 311, 349-353, 374-380). This being so, the Court cannot accept the applicant company’s argument that the letter-box entities had been entitled to the tax exemptions in questions. For the same reason, the Court dismisses the applicant company’s argument that all the constituent members of the Yukos group had made regular tax declarations and had applied regularly for tax refunds and that the authorities were thus aware of the functioning of the arrangement. The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety on the sole basis on the tax declarations and requests for tax refunds made by the trading companies, the applicant company and its subsidiaries."

The arrangement was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices (see paragraphs 395-399), and by its nature involved certain operations, such as unilateral gifts between the trading companies and the applicant company through its subsidiaries, which were incompatible with the rules governing the relations between independent legal entities (see paragraph 376). In this connection, the Court finds relevant the warning given by the company’s auditor about the implications of the use of the company’s special fund during the year 2002 (see paragraphs 206 - 209 ) and is not persuaded by the applicant company’s reference to case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 (see paragraphs 356 - 357 ), the expert opinion of its counsel (see paragraph 577) and its reliance on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 376)."

The courts established that the entity had some assets, employees and a bank account at the place of its registration and dismissed the Ministry’s claims. As regards the expert opinion and the company’s reference to Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code, the Court finds them irrelevant as they refer to the relations of openly associated companies and not, as was the case at issue, to the use of sham entities fraudulently registered in the name of certain third parties. Thus, the Court cannot agree with the applicant company’s allegation that its particular way of “optimising tax” had been previously examined by the domestic courts and upheld as valid or that it had used lawful “tax optimisation techniques” which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts. The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the findings of the domestic courts that applicant company’s tax arrangements were unlawful at the time when the company had used them, were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable."

In view of the above and relying on Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code which established a refutable presumption of good faith and reasonableness of actions of the parties in commercial transactions (see paragraph 48 and 382-383), the courts then changed the characterisation of the sales operations of the sham entities. They decided that these were in reality conducted by the applicant company and that it had been incumbent on the latter to fulfil the corresponding obligation to pay various taxes on these activities. Finally, the courts noted that the setting up and running of the sham arrangement by the applicant company resulted in an understating of the taxable base of its operations and, as a consequence, the intentional non-payment of various taxes, which was punishable as a tax offence under Article 122 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 400)."

This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time. Thus, Article 45 (2) 3 of the Tax Code explicitly provided the domestic courts with the power to change the legal characterisation of transactions and also the legal characterisation of the status and activity of the taxpayer, whilst section 7 of the Law on the Tax Authorities of the Russian Federation granted the right to contest such transactions to the tax authorities (see paragraph 393). In addition, the case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 (see paragraphs 382-393 and paragraphs 428-468). Moreover, in a number of its rulings, including decision of 25 July 2001 no. 138-0 specifically relied upon by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings against the applicant company (see paragraphs 384-387), the Constitutional Court confirmed the significance of this principle, having mentioned various possible consequences of a taxpayer’s bad faith conduct."

On the facts, it would be impossible to expect from a statutory provision to describe in detail all possible ways in which a given taxpayer could abuse a legal system and defraud the tax authorities.

France, no. 60495/00, §§ 55-59, 31 January 2006).",

It safeguards persons (including legal persons) who are “placed in analogous situations” against discriminatory differences of treatment; and, for the purposes of Article 14, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it “has no objective and reasonable justification”, that is, if it does not pursue a “legitimate aim” or if there is not a “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised” (see, amongst many authorities, Rasmussen v. Denmark, 28 November 1984, §§ 35 and 38, Series A no. 87).

The company complained that the courts ought to have intervened and corrected the assessment of this matter by the bailiffs. The authorities should have first considered and accepted its offers of shares in OAO Sibneft, and/or allowed the company to make deferred payments over a prolonged period. As regards such deferred payments, the company submitted that the domestic law and practice gave priority to such a solution and that OAO Rosneft was able to obtain such a deferral in respect of the tax debts of OAO Yuganskneftegaz following the auction of 19 December 2004. The company argued that it could have repaid the debt, entirely or in part, had it not been for the attachment imposed by the court.

It disagreed with the decision to sell OAO Yuganskneftegaz, arguing that under the domestic legislation OAO Yuganskneftegaz should have been the last item to be auctioned, and that the auction had been incapable of generating a reasonably good price because of the limited number of candidates, the widespread perception of the need for political support to acquire the item in question and insufficient time for preparation. The applicant company was also dissatisfied with the decision to sell only the voting shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, as opposed to all of the shares.

The Government submitted that both the seizure and freezing orders were usual practice, both domestically and internationally, and their use was especially appropriate in the present case because of the unprecedented amounts of the tax debts, the unrepentant and defiant attitude of the applicant company, claims that the authorities’ actions were a “malicious tax racket” and the applicant company’s history, namely its management and core shareholders moving corporate assets into new shell entities and sometimes into foreign tax havens.

The applicant company could have had the injunction lifted had it provided adequate counter-security, which it failed to do, or liquidated some of its foreign assets not covered by the injunction. The Government maintained that instead of selling its foreign assets to meet its tax debts the applicant company simply stripped them away, which in itself proved that the company’s complaint about the injunction was unsubstantiated. As regards the freezing orders, the Government submitted that they had been issued by the bailiffs pursuant to court writs dated 30 June 2004, which froze the company’s accounts in Russian banks as of the date of issue of the respective freezing orders. The company could still dispose of cash added to its frozen accounts after 30 June 2004 and could use its non-seized accounts abroad. The funds in these accounts had been far lower than the company’s then liabilities. The Government further noted that as of 14 July 2004 the applicant company had still to pay 96.5% of its then liability and that the company’s voluntary payment only commenced on 14 July 2004, apparently as a response to the seizure of the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz.

In addition, the law did not allow for respite and payment spread if there were pending tax proceedings against the taxpayer at issue.

They claimed that this period was sufficient, as taxpayers usually learned about tax claims - with a specific indication of the sums to be paid - in the Ministry’s audit reports, which were usually served from several weeks to a few months in advance. Thus, in the present case the applicant company had first learned of the Ministry’s claims for the years 2000-2003 109, 66, 19 and 18 days in advance. More generally, in such cases the taxpayer usually knew well in advance the sums that had been underpaid (typically during tax evasion), so it cannot claim that it was unprepared.

The first three offers, made on 22 April, 2 July and 13-14 July 2004, all involved various portions of shares of OAO Sibneft, allegedly owned by the applicant company. All three offers were rejected, not only because the company’s ownership of these shares had been contested in various unrelated proceedings by third persons, but also because the offers had been made in violation of injunctions issued by the courts in the above-mentioned unrelated proceedings. In fact, the sale of shares that did belong to the applicant company (some 20%) would have been insufficient to cover the company’s then debt, even in part, let alone satisfy the Ministry’s upcoming claims for the years 2001-2003. It was a minority stake of uncertain value and any such value was in any event insufficient to satisfy the company’s tax arrears. As regards the fourth offer, dated 9 August 2004, it involved 20% of OAO Sibneft and a farrago of shares in fifteen companies (some of them subsidiaries, some of them minority stakes and all of uncertain liquidity). In any event, this offer was “too little and too late” for the Government, since preparation for the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been under way. The above-mentioned “shopping list” did not offer any guarantee of a “good chance of fetching a price sufficient to discharge much of [the applicant’s] rapidly increasing tax liabilities” and in addition involved a high risk of third-party claims to the property in question in each case."

On 18 November 2004 the bailiffs decided to sell 43 shares (76.8%) of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction. The Government noted that OAO Yuganskneftegaz was itself the debtor in mandatory payments to the budget totalling RUB 102.09 billion, so that the above arrears inevitably affected the price of the auctioned shares, as defined by the valuation institution and the results of the auction. The date of the auction and invitation to participate in the open auction were published in the mass media in due time. The auction itself was open, both with regard to its participants and to the form of submissions of price bids. Bids were received between 19 November and 18 December 2004.

The auction itself was public. The mass media representatives provided extensive media coverage. The results were published in the mass media and broadcast. With regard to the proportionality of the sale, the sum of 260.5 billion roubles generated as a result of the sale did not, however, cover the arrears of OAO Yukos entirely. The Government also underlined that the subsequent bankruptcy was not caused by the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, but had been initiated by a consortium of foreign banks and that the representatives of the applicant company had allegedly acknowledged that the company had been in good financial condition even despite the sale of OAO Yuganksneftegaz.

As regards the seizure orders of 14 July 2004 concerning OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegaz, the City Court upheld them by respective judgments of 13 August and 2 September 2004, whilst the Circuit Court confirmed this conclusion by the respective decisions of 5 November 2004 and 18 January 2005 (see paragraphs 147 - 155 )."

Admittedly, the applicant company did not complain about the attachment order of 15 April 2004 by way of cassation and omitted the appeal procedure when contesting the seizure of its subsidiaries on 1 July 2004 and the seizure order of 14 July 2004 concerning OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegaz. The Court would note, however, that given the circumstances of the applicant company’s tax case, its overall situation at the relevant time, the applicable domestic law and the courts’ responses to the arguments put forward by the applicant company in those proceedings, it is clear that both the attachment order of 15 April 2004 and the subsequent seizure orders of 1 and 14 July 2004 have been properly examined and confirmed by the domestic courts at various levels of jurisdictions and it does not appear that the applicant company’s complaints in this connection had any additional prospects of success, had the company not omitted the above-mentioned judicial instances."

The company’s challenge to this fee was examined and dismissed by the courts at three instances only in respect of the year 2000 (see paragraphs 130 - 134 ), whilst its complaints about the payment of the fee for the year 2001 were examined only at first instance and in cassation (see paragraphs 177 - 187 ). Also, it is not entirely clear whether the applicant company brought court proceedings in respect of the entire amount of the fee for the year 2002 (see paragraphs 200 - 204 ) and whether it brought any proceedings against such an order for the year 2003 (see paragraph 221 ). The Court again finds that, given the similarity of the orders for payment of enforcement fees for the years 2000-2003 and in view of other relevant circumstances such as the applicable domestic law and the courts’ answers to the company’s arguments in respect of the fee for the year 2000, there is nothing in the Government’s submissions to suggest that the applicant company’s complaints in this connection would have had any prospects of success had the applicant company appealed against them."

As regards the alleged failure by the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings and the bailiffs’ alleged inaction in respect of the Sibneft shares, the Court notes that the above-mentioned grievances are entirely subsumed by the complaint concerning the method of enforcement of the tax debt and in particular the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first asset to be sold in satisfaction of the tax claims. In this connection, the Court would note that the applicant company clearly exhausted the available domestic remedies as regards the seizure and the subsequent measures leading to the eventual sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraphs 137 - 146 ), and it is also clear that the relevant domestic law specifically disallowed the courts to rearrange or otherwise postpone the repayment of the debt (see paragraphs 471-477) if there were, as in the case at hand, pending tax proceedings against the debtor. Thus, the applicant company could not have been expected to bring separate court proceedings in this connection. Overall, it is clear to the Court that the applicant company used all the remedies that it could reasonably be expected to use in connection with this part of the application."

                "645. Turning to the substance of the applicant company’s complaints, the Court notes that in April 2004, simultaneously with the Tax Assessment proceedings, the domestic authorities initiated enforcement proceedings aimed at securing their tax claims and later recovering the sums awarded by the courts as a result of the examination of these claims. They attached the company’s assets located in Russia and later partly froze the company’s domestic bank accounts and seized the shares of the applicant company’s Russian subsidiaries. On 20 July 2004 it was decided to auction off the company’s principal production subsidiary OAO Yuganskneftegaz, in satisfaction of the company’s tax liability, which at the time amounted to RUB 106.182 billion (some EUR 3.005 billion). As a result of the proceedings with regard to the Tax Assessments 2001 and 2002, the company’s debt to the tax authorities further increased and by the time the auction of OAO Yuganskneftegaz took place in December 2004 the company already owed the tax authorities some RUB 431.259 billion (some EUR 11.061 billion). In addition to the payments resulting from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003, the company was also required to pay the bailiffs a 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt."
            ],
            [
                "646. The Court notes that the authorities used a variety of measures in connection with the enforcement of the debt, such as the attachment and freezing orders, the seizure orders, the orders to pay enforcement fees and the compulsory auction procedure. Though each of these measures could be seen as a separate instance of interference with the applicant company’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, their common and ultimate goal was to force the company to meet its tax liabilities. Accordingly, the appropriate way to analyse this part of the application is to examine the enforcement proceedings in their entirety as one continuous event. The Court further notes that the enforcement measures in question fall to be analysed under the third rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which allows the member States to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing “such laws as [they] deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties”. It follows that the Court’s task is to determine whether the State authorities complied with the Convention requirement of lawfulness and, if so, whether they struck a fair balance between the legitimate state interest in enforcing the tax debt in question and the protection of the applicant company’s rights set forth in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "647. As regards the lawfulness of the measures in question, the Court has no reason to doubt that throughout the proceedings the actions of various authorities had a lawful basis and that the legal provisions in question were sufficiently precise and clear to meet the Convention standards concerning the quality of law. The attachment, freezing and seizure orders were reviewed by the domestic courts and found to have been lawful. Likewise, the 7% enforcement fee was upheld by the domestic courts and cannot be said to have been selective, given the domestic case-law cited by the Government. As regards the decisions leading to the forced sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction and the auction process itself, the Court notes that they too were reviewed and upheld by the domestic courts as lawful (see paragraphs 263 and 265) and there is nothing in the case file or the parties’ submissions to cast doubt on these conclusions. The only question that remains is whether the enforcement measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

In this connection the Court would reiterate that its task is to determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the public and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It finds it natural that in the tax sphere the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their policies. Nevertheless, the Court cannot fail to exercise its power of review and must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant company’s right to “the peaceful enjoyment of [its] possessions”, within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

            [
                "649. At the outset the Court notes the background to this case and, in particular, the fact that the applicant company was one of the largest taxpayers in Russia and that it had been suspected and subsequently found guilty of running a tax evasion scheme, committed consecutively in 2000-2003. From the parties’ submissions and the case file it seems clear that the applicant company had no cash funds in its domestic accounts to pay its tax debts immediately, and in view of the nature and scale of the debt it was unlikely that any third party would agree to assist the company with a loan or some form of security. Regard being had to the scale of the tax evasion, the sums involved for the years 2000-2003, the fact under domestic law that they were payable almost at once after the production of the respective execution writ (see paragraph 471), and even taking into account the Court’s previous findings in respect of the fines for the years 2000 and 2001, it was questionable whether at the time when the authorities decided to seize and auction OAO Yuganskneftegaz the company was at all solvent within the meaning of section 3 of the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act, which generally expected the solvent debtor to repay its debts “within three months of the date on which compliance should have occurred” (see paragraph 496)."
            ],
            [
                "650. In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the crux of the applicant company’s case did not lay in the attachment of its assets and cash as such, but rather and essentially in the speed with which the authorities demanded the company to pay, in the decision which had chosen the company’s main production unit, OAO Yuganskneftegaz, as the item to be compulsorily auctioned in the first instance, and in the speed with which the auction had been carried out."

                "651. Given the paramount importance of the measures taken by the authorities to the applicant company’s future, and notwithstanding the Government’s wide margin of appreciation in this field, the Court is of the view that the authorities were obliged to take careful and explicit account of all relevant factors in the enforcement process. Such factors were to include, among other things, the character and the amount of the existing debt as well as of the pending and probable claims against the applicant company, the nature of the company’s business and the relative weight of the company in the domestic economy, the company’s current and probable economic situation and the assessment of its capacity to survive the enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, the economic and social implications of various enforcement options on the company and the various categories of stakeholders, the attitude of the company’s management and owners and the actual conduct of the applicant company during the enforcement proceedings, including the merits of the offers that the applicant company may have made in connection with the enforcement were to be properly considered."
            ],
            [
                "652. The Court notes that the authorities examined and made findings in respect of some of these factors (see, for instance, the findings in respect of the offers of shares in OAO Sibneft in paragraph 124 or the findings in respect of request for payment spread in paragraph 157 ), but it is clear that at no point in the enforcement proceedings did they make an explicit assessment in respect of all of them. In particular, neither the seizure order of 14 July 2004, which set in motion the process of auctioning OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraph 137 ), nor any of the subsequent decisions, including the judicial decisions in the context of the company’s complaints against the actions of the bailiffs (see paragraphs 137 - 158 ), mentioned or discussed in any detail possible alternative methods of enforcement and the consequences that they might have on the future of the company."
            ],
            [
                "653. The Court finds this aspect of the enforcement proceedings of utmost importance when striking a balance between the interests concerned, given that the sums that were already owed by the company in July 2004 made it rather obvious that the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first item to be auctioned in satisfaction of the company’s liability was capable of dealing a fatal blow to its ability to survive the tax claims and to continue its existence."
            ],
            [
                "654. The Court accepts that the bailiffs were bound to follow the applicable domestic legislation which might limit the variety of options in the enforcement procedure. Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that, notwithstanding these constraints, the bailiffs still had a decisive freedom of choice, the exercise of which could either keep the company afloat or eventually lead to its demise. Although the Court, in principle, does not find the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz entirely unreasonable, especially in view of the overall amount of the tax-related debt and the pending as well as probable claims against the company, it is of the view that before definitively selecting for sale the asset that was the company’s only hope of survival, the authorities should have given very serious consideration to other options, especially those that could mitigate the damage to the applicant company’s structure. This was particularly so since all of the company’s domestic assets had been attached by previous court orders (see paragraph 27 ), and were readily available, the company itself did not seem to have objected to their sale (see paragraph 159) and there had been virtually no risk of the company seriously opposing these actions."

            [
                "655. The Court further notes one other factor which seriously affected the company’s situation in the enforcement proceedings. The applicant company was subjected to a 7% enforcement fee in connection with the entire amount of its tax-related liability, which constituted an additional hefty sum of over RUB 43 billion (EUR 1.16 billion), the payment of which could not be suspended or rescheduled (see paragraphs 484-486). This was a flat-rate fee which the authorities apparently refused to reduce, and these sums had to be paid even before the company could begin repaying the main body of the debt (see paragraph 484). The fee was by its nature unrelated to the actual amount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs. Whilst the Court may accept that there is nothing wrong as a matter of principle with requiring a debtor to pay for the expenses relating to the enforcement of a debt or to threaten a debtor with a sanction to incite his or her voluntary compliance with enforcement writs, in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs. Because of its rigid application, instead of inciting voluntary compliance, it contributed very seriously to the applicant company’s demise."

Lastly, the Court would again emphasise that the authorities were unyieldingly inflexible as to the pace of the enforcement proceedings, acting very swiftly and constantly refusing to concede to the applicant company’s demands for additional time. Admittedly, this rigidity may have resulted at least in part from the relevant requirements of the domestic law (see paragraphs 471, 481 and 489). Nevertheless, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the case such lack of flexibility had a negative overall effect on the conduct of the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company."

Despite the fact that it found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the speed with which the courts had conducted the proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case and a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the interference by the Constitutional Court with the outcome of the 2000 Tax Assessment case in the part relating to penalties, the Court rejected the applicant company’s claims that the company’s debt had been recognised as a result of an unforeseeable, unlawful and arbitrary interpretation of the domestic law (see paragraphs 605 and 616). The Court also recognised the right of the State to enforce, as such, the court judgments, but reached conclusions concerning the handling of the enforcement proceedings by the domestic authorities which lead to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

In general this includes not only the right to be present, but also the right to receive legal assistance, if necessary, and to follow the proceedings effectively.

However, under the Code of Judicial Procedure, the courts were obliged to appoint public defence counsel under certain circumstances. Referring to chapter 21, section 3 a, subsection 2 (2) of the Code, the Government contended that in cases concerning aggravated drunken driving there might be reason to give a conditional sentence combined with an order to undergo different kinds of treatment and the courts therefore often consider the assistance of counsel to be necessary in order to have put forward arguments relating to the personal circumstances of the accused which speak in favour of penalties other than imprisonment. In the applicant’s case, the District Court had appointed a public defence counsel of its own motion, obviously considering that the interests of justice required legal assistance. It is primarily for the domestic authorities to make such an assessment. By appointing a public defence counsel for the applicant, the court had guaranteed the right to an adequate defence. Moreover, the applicant had not been prevented from appointing S. as his private defence counsel. Nothing in the case-files of the Swedish courts indicated that the applicant had informed the courts that he was prepared to pay S.’s fees himself. If he had done so, the courts would certainly have revoked H.’s appointment as public defence counsel."

In seeking to have H. replaced by S., the applicant had given the District Court no reasons for his request and had not referred to any co-operation difficulties or lack of confidence in H. before the Court of Appeal. Moreover, he had not brought to the attention of the courts any particular shortcomings in the defence conducted by H. Although told by the District Court to state the reasons for his replacement request in writing, the applicant did not do so. A formal request for H. to be replaced by S. was not made until the case was pending before the Court of Appeal, at which stage of the proceedings a change of public defence counsel would have entailed substantial additional costs. The Government were further of the opinion that the assessment made by the courts of the need to replace defence counsel must clearly be considered as falling within the margin of appreciation afforded to a Contracting State when examining a question of this character. They also submitted that the minutes of the oral hearing before the Court of Appeal did not indicate that the applicant had objected to H.’s attendance as public defence counsel or that the applicant had been prevented from conducting his own defence."

It might be justified to appoint public defence counsel for a suspect in very complicated cases, but drunken driving and other traffic offences were not serious enough to warrant such an appointment against the will of the suspect. However, the applicant had denied the later charge of aggravated assault. At that moment, due to the severity of the charge and his understanding that he risked a long term of imprisonment, he had expressed the wish to be assisted by public defence counsel. He had clearly requested that S. be appointed. This request had been denied without specific reasons being given."

In general, communication between the defendant and his counsel is crucial in planning an effective defence strategy. Moreover, as S. had his office in the same city as H., there would not have been any increased costs in appointing him as public defence counsel. Further, he would have paid S.’s fees, if necessary.

Before the Court the applicant has stated that he did not wish to have public defence counsel appointed for him during the initial proceedings and that traffic offences were not serious enough to warrant such an appointment against his will.

The Court accepts the Government’s contention that this situation often arises in cases concerning aggravated drunken driving as there might be reason to give a conditional sentence combined with an order to undergo different kinds of treatment. Further considering that the assessment whether the interests of justice require that an accused be provided with legal assistance primarily rests with the national authorities, the Court finds that neither the legal requirement of legal assistance under the Code of Judicial Procedure nor the District Court’s appointment of H. as the applicant’s public defence counsel contravened the applicant’s rights under Article 6 of the Convention, notwithstanding his obligation to pay a minor part of the litigation costs in the case."

It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned. When appointing defence counsel the courts must certainly have regard to the accused’s wishes but these can be overridden when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see the Croissant v. Germany judgment cited above, p. 33, § 29)."

As a general rule, this is equally true for an appeal by way of rehearing.

The Supreme Court went on to hold that it was true that since the introduction of the Code of Criminal Procedure the right to file an objection had been considerably curtailed, but pointed out that in so doing the legislature had not changed the character of trial in absentia.

As a general rule, this is equally true for an appeal by way of rehearing. However, it is also of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal, the more so if, as is the case under Netherlands law, no objection may be filed against a default judgment given on appeal (see paragraph 22 above).",

According to them, although Mr. Della Rocca declined to undertake the task entrusted to him on 8 August 1972 by the President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Cassation, he continued to the very end and \"for all purposes\" to be the applicant ’ s lawyer. In the Government ’ s view, Mr. Artico was, in short, complaining of the failure to appoint a substitute but this amounted to claiming a right which was not guaranteed.",
                "The Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective; this is particularly so of the rights of the defence in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, from which they derive (see the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 12-13, par. 24, and paragraph 32 above). As the Commission ’ s Delegates correctly emphasised, Article 6 par. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) speaks of \"assistance\" and not of \"nomination\". Again, mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance since the lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes may die, fall seriously ill, be prevented for a protracted period from acting or shirk his duties. If they are notified of the situation, the authorities must either replace him or cause him to fulfil his obligations. Adoption of the Government ’ s restrictive interpretation would lead to results that are unreasonable and incompatible with both the wording of sub-paragraph (c) (art. 6-3-c) and the structure of Article 6 (art. 6) taken as a whole; in many instances free legal assistance might prove to be worthless.",
                "In the present case, Mr. Artico did not have the benefit of Mr. Della Rocca ’ s services at any point of time. From the very outset, the lawyer stated that he was unable to act. He invoked firstly the existence of other commitments and subsequently his state of health (see paragraph 14 above). The Court is not called upon to enquire into the relevance of these explanations. It finds, as did the Commission (see paragraph 98 of the report), that the applicant did not receive effective assistance before the Court of Cassation; as far as he was concerned, the above-mentioned decision of 8 August 1972 remained a dead letter."

                "34. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 par. 3 (art. 6-3-c) does, nevertheless, make entitlement to the right it sets forth dependent on two conditions. Whilst here there was no argument over the first condition - that the person charged with a criminal offence does not have sufficient means -, the Government denied that the second condition was satisfied: on their view, the \"interests of justice\" did not require that Mr. Artico be provided with free legal aid. The subject-matter of the Court of Cassation proceedings was, so the Government claimed, crystallized by the grounds adduced in support of the applications to quash, grounds that were filed by the applicant in December 1971 with the assistance of a lawyer of his own choice, Mr. Ferri. However, the Government continued, the grounds related to an issue - the regularity of the summons to appear in court - that was of the utmost simplicity, so much so that the public prosecutor pleaded in July 1973 that the applications were manifestly ill-founded (see paragraphs 9-10 above); hence, a lawyer would have played but a \"modest\" role, limited to receiving notification to the effect that the Court of Cassation would take its decision in chambers (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "According to the Commission ’ s Delegates, this opinion contrasted with that of the President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Cassation. By 8 August 1972, when this judge granted the legal aid that had been requested on 10 March, several months had elapsed since the filing of the applications to quash and the supporting grounds; moreover, Mr. Artico had sent to the registry, on 10 and 14/15 March, declarations which he had drafted himself and which set out his further arguments ( see paragraphs 9-10 above). Nevertheless, the President came to the conclusion that there was a genuine need for a lawyer to be nominated for legal aid purposes. The Delegates doubted whether it was open to the Government to argue the contrary at the present time.",
                "The Court recalls that, subject to certain exceptions not pertinent to the present case, anyone who is in a state of poverty is entitled under Italian law to free legal aid in criminal matters (Article 15 of Royal Decree no. 3282 of 30 December 1923; see also Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",
                "In any event, here the interests of justice did require the provision of effective assistance. This would, according to Mr. Della Rocca, have been a very demanding and onerous task (see paragraph 14 above). At any rate, the written procedure, which is of prime importance before the Italian Court of Cassation, had not been concluded by 8 August 1972. A qualified lawyer would have been able to clarify the grounds adduced by Mr. Artico and, in particular, to give the requisite emphasis to the crucial issue of statutory limitation which had hardly been touched on in the \"voluminous and verbose\" declarations of 14/15 March 1972 (see paragraph 10 above and the verbatim record of the hearing of 31 January 1980). In addition, only a lawyer could have countered the pleadings of the public prosecutor ’ s department by causing the Court of Cassation to hold a public hearing devoted, amongst other things, to a thorough discussion of this issue (see paragraph 17 above)."

                "35. The Government objected that this was pure conjecture. In their view, for there to be a violation of Article 6 par. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c), the lack of assistance must have actually prejudiced the person charged with a criminal offence.",
                "The Court points out, in company with the Commission ’ s Delegates, that here the Government are asking for the impossible since it cannot be proved beyond all doubt that a substitute for Mr. Della Rocca would have pleaded statutory limitation and would have convinced the Court of Cassation when the applicant did not succeed in doing so. Nevertheless, it appears plausible in the particular circumstances that this would have happened. Above all, there is nothing in Article 6 par. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) indicating that such proof is necessary; an interpretation that introduced this requirement into the sub-paragraph would deprive it in large measure of its substance. More generally, the existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice (see the Marckx judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 13, par. 27); prejudice is relevant only in the context of Article 50 (art. 50)."

                "Secondly, domestic remedies had not been exhausted (Article 26) (art. 26) since the applicant had not complained of Mr. Della Rocca ’ s conduct either to the Bar Association ( Ordine degli avvocati ) or by instituting a civil action for damages or criminal proceedings in respect of failure by a lawyer to meet his professional obligations (\" patrocinio infedele \"; Article 380 of the Italian Criminal Code).",
                "Thirdly, if one sought - erroneously, in the Government ’ s view – to hold the State responsible for the lack of legal assistance, any notional \"final decision\" of the Court of Cassation refusing to appoint another lawyer could only have been taken before 3 and 10 July 1973. There was therefore an interval of more than six months between that decision and the reference of the matter to the Commission - 26 April or 12 July 1974 -, the conclusion being that Mr. Artico had not observed the six months ’ time-limit laid down by Article 26 (art. 26) of the Convention."

Admittedly, the Government had already relied on the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies before the Commission in July 1976 and February 1977 but they did so on totally different grounds and solely in relation to the complaints under Article 5 (art. 5), complaints which were moreover rejected by that institution on 1 March 1977 pursuant to Article 27 par. 3 (art. 27-3) (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above; Appendix II to the report, section \"Submissions of the Parties\", paragraphs 1 and 2 b., and section \"The Law\", paragraph 1)."

The pleas were not accepted by the Commission: failing unanimity amongst its members, it considered that Article 29 (art. 29) was not applicable in the instant case. In point of fact, paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Commission ’ s report do not contain enough details for it to be determined whether the arguments then put forward by the Government were substantially identical to those now advanced; however, this may be assumed to be so since the Commission ’ s Delegates gave no indication to the contrary."

On the other hand, the Delegates did point out that the hearing of 8 December 1978 related to the merits of the application and not to its admissibility on which the Commission had given its decision more than twenty-one months previously, namely on 1 March 1977. On that basis, they contended that there was estoppel as regards these two pleas as well.",

The function of sifting which Articles 26 and 27 (art. 26, art. 27) assign to the Commission is the first of its tasks (above-mentioned judgment of 18 June 1971, p. 30, par. 51). Admittedly Article 29 (art. 29), which has been in force since 21 September 1970, provides for a subsequent review of admissibility but it makes an \"a posteriori\" rejection of an application conditional on a unanimous vote by the Commission. The stringency of this condition, which marks a departure from the principle of decision by a majority laid down in Article 34 (art. 34), demonstrates that the spirit of the Convention requires that respondent States should normally raise their preliminary objections at the stage of the initial examination of admissibility, failing which they will be estopped.",
                "It is true that the reason prompting a preliminary objection sometimes comes to light only after the decision accepting the application: for example, a reversal of domestic case-law may disclose the existence of a hitherto unknown remedy (above-mentioned judgment of 18 June 1971, pp. 24-25, par. 37, pp. 31-32, par. 56-57, and pp. 33-35, par. 61-62) or an applicant may formulate a new complaint whose admissibility the respondent Government have not yet had the opportunity of contesting ( Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 8, par. 15, and pp. 19-20, par. 39-40; Schiesser judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, p. 10, par. 20-21, and pp. 16-17, par. 39-41). In such cases, the circumstances do not permit reliance on grounds of inadmissibility at an earlier date; what is more, despite the apparent generality of the wording of Article 29 (art. 29), the respondent State is entitled by analogy to the benefit of the provisions governing the initial stage of the proceedings, in other words to obtain from the Commission, in a supplementary decision, a ruling by majority vote (Article 34) (art. 34) on the questions of jurisdiction or admissibility submitted to the Commission by the State immediately it has been led to do so by the change in the legal situation (above-mentioned Schiesser judgment, p. 17, par. 41).",
                "However, the present case does not furnish an example of a situation of this kind. Nothing prevented the Government from inviting the Commission, before 1 March 1977, to reject the application ratione temporis or for failure to comply with the six months ’ time-limit. Yet the Government unnecessarily deferred doing this until 8 December 1978 with the consequence that their plea could have succeeded only in the event of a unanimous vote (Article 29) (art. 29). The Government thereby lost the advantage of a decision by a majority (Article 34) (art. 34) and they cannot be taken to have recovered it by applying to the Court (Rule 20 par 1 of the Rules of Court); to hold otherwise would lead to a result that would be incompatible with the structure of the Convention and with a proper administration of justice."

The Government, on the other hand, regarded the obligation as satisfied by the nomination of a lawyer for legal aid purposes, contending that what occurred thereafter was in no way the concern of the Italian Republic. According to them, although Mr. Della Rocca declined to undertake the task entrusted to him on 8 August 1972 by the President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Cassation, he continued to the very end and \"for all purposes\" to be the applicant ’ s lawyer. In the Government ’ s view, Mr. Artico was, in short, complaining of the failure to appoint a substitute but this amounted to claiming a right which was not guaranteed.",
                "The Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective; this is particularly so of the rights of the defence in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, from which they derive (see the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 12-13, par. 24, and paragraph 32 above). As the Commission ’ s Delegates correctly emphasised, Article 6 par. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) speaks of \"assistance\" and not of \"nomination\". Again, mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance since the lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes may die, fall seriously ill, be prevented for a protracted period from acting or shirk his duties. If they are notified of the situation, the authorities must either replace him or cause him to fulfil his obligations. Adoption of the Government ’ s restrictive interpretation would lead to results that are unreasonable and incompatible with both the wording of sub-paragraph (c) (art. 6-3-c) and the structure of Article 6 (art. 6) taken as a whole; in many instances free legal assistance might prove to be worthless.",

It finds, as did the Commission (see paragraph 98 of the report), that the applicant did not receive effective assistance before the Court of Cassation; as far as he was concerned, the above-mentioned decision of 8 August 1972 remained a dead letter."

Whilst here there was no argument over the first condition - that the person charged with a criminal offence does not have sufficient means -, the Government denied that the second condition was satisfied: on their view, the \"interests of justice\" did not require that Mr. Artico be provided with free legal aid. The subject-matter of the Court of Cassation proceedings was, so the Government claimed, crystallized by the grounds adduced in support of the applications to quash, grounds that were filed by the applicant in December 1971 with the assistance of a lawyer of his own choice, Mr. Ferri. However, the Government continued, the grounds related to an issue - the regularity of the summons to appear in court - that was of the utmost simplicity, so much so that the public prosecutor pleaded in July 1973 that the applications were manifestly ill-founded (see paragraphs 9-10 above); hence, a lawyer would have played but a \"modest\" role, limited to receiving notification to the effect that the Court of Cassation would take its decision in chambers (see paragraph 17 above).",

By 8 August 1972, when this judge granted the legal aid that had been requested on 10 March, several months had elapsed since the filing of the applications to quash and the supporting grounds; moreover, Mr. Artico had sent to the registry, on 10 and 14/15 March, declarations which he had drafted himself and which set out his further arguments ( see paragraphs 9-10 above). Nevertheless, the President came to the conclusion that there was a genuine need for a lawyer to be nominated for legal aid purposes. The Delegates doubted whether it was open to the Government to argue the contrary at the present time.",

This would, according to Mr. Della Rocca, have been a very demanding and onerous task (see paragraph 14 above). At any rate, the written procedure, which is of prime importance before the Italian Court of Cassation, had not been concluded by 8 August 1972. A qualified lawyer would have been able to clarify the grounds adduced by Mr. Artico and, in particular, to give the requisite emphasis to the crucial issue of statutory limitation which had hardly been touched on in the \"voluminous and verbose\" declarations of 14/15 March 1972 (see paragraph 10 above and the verbatim record of the hearing of 31 January 1980). In addition, only a lawyer could have countered the pleadings of the public prosecutor ’ s department by causing the Court of Cassation to hold a public hearing devoted, amongst other things, to a thorough discussion of this issue (see paragraph 17 above)."

Nevertheless, it appears plausible in the particular circumstances that this would have happened. Above all, there is nothing in Article 6 par. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) indicating that such proof is necessary; an interpretation that introduced this requirement into the sub-paragraph would deprive it in large measure of its substance. More generally, the existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice (see the Marckx judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 13, par. 27); prejudice is relevant only in the context of Article 50 (art. 50)."

Admittedly, a State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes but, in the particular circumstances, it was for the competent Italian authorities to take steps to ensure that the applicant enjoyed effectively the right to which they had recognised he was entitled. Two courses were open to the authorities: either to replace Mr. Della Rocca or, if appropriate, to cause him to fulfil his obligations (see paragraph 33 above).

It notes in the first place, like the Government, that the State cannot be held responsible for any inadequacy or mistake in the conduct of the applicant’s defence attributable to his officially appointed lawyer. It considers, however, that in certain circumstances negligent failure to comply with a purely formal condition cannot be equated with an injudicious line of defence or a mere defect of argumentation. That is so when as a result of such negligence a defendant is deprived of a remedy without the situation being put right by a higher court. It should be pointed out in that connection that the applicant was a foreigner who did not know the language in which the proceedings were being conducted and who was facing charges which made him liable to – and indeed led to – a lengthy prison sentence."

In particular, it took the view that an appellant was not entitled to be asked to make good any deficiencies of his appeal, unlike the position provided for in Article 690 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That was justified by the particular requirements of speedy trial imposed by criminal procedure, the question of celerity being deemed not to be raised in the same terms in civil cases. It was therefore normal for the Supreme Court to dismiss appeals on points of law, for example, on account of the prolixity of the related pleadings, regard being had to the provision in Article 412 § 1 requiring an appellant to “summarise” the reasons for his appeal."

While it has frequently observed that the Convention is designed to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective, assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused. Nevertheless, a State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether appointed under a legal-aid scheme or privately financed. The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 § 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Daud, cited above, pp. 749-50, § 38)."

In its opinion the Commission expressed the following view (ibid., pp. 756-57, § 50):",

It considers, however, that in certain circumstances negligent failure to comply with a purely formal condition cannot be equated with an injudicious line of defence or a mere defect of argumentation. That is so when as a result of such negligence a defendant is deprived of a remedy without the situation being put right by a higher court. It should be pointed out in that connection that the applicant was a foreigner who did not know the language in which the proceedings were being conducted and who was facing charges which made him liable to – and indeed led to – a lengthy prison sentence."

However, the fact that on 3 August 1995 he lodged an appeal himself against the judgment of the Sintra Criminal Court was a first sign that he was not entirely in agreement with the way the officially appointed lawyer was conducting his defence, even though that appeal could not be examined immediately by a judge because he had written it in a foreign language. The Court emphasises in passing that the Supreme Court’s judgment quashing the decision given by the judge of the Sintra District Court on 12 September 1995 had no practical impact on the applicant’s situation, since the Supreme Court later took the view that the content of the appeal lodged by the applicant himself could not “affect or influence the course of the proceedings” or the finality of his conviction (see paragraph 37 above)."

Secondly, it considers that it cannot be said a priori that such a situation would inevitably infringe the principle of equality of arms, given that it would be more in the nature of a manifestation of the judge’s power to direct the proceedings, exercised with a view to the proper administration of justice. It should be pointed out that Portuguese legislation itself permits judges in civil cases to issue such an invitation without it ever being suggested that this implies some loss of independence for members of the legal profession or an infringement of the principle of equality of arms and without there being in that respect the slightest difference between a lawyer appointed by the court under the legal-aid scheme and a lawyer freely chosen. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court recently held to be unconstitutional those provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure – and the provisions of similar legislation relating to summary offences – which required the relevant courts to dismiss appeals out of hand without any prior invitation to the appellant to rectify or add to his pleading in this type of case. It would appear that, as matters stand in Portugal at present, a decision like the one taken by the Supreme Court on 10 July 1996 would no longer be possible as a result of that recent ruling of the Constitutional Court."

Referring to its decision of 10 May, the Court of Appeal refused to accede to the request of the defence to hear the six anonymous witnesses. However, in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court of 2 July 1990 (see paragraph 46 below), it decided to refer the case back to the investigating judge, requesting her to record her findings as to the reliability of the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16, adding that if in order to appraise their reliability the investigating judge found it necessary to hear them again she should do so. Although the expert K. was present at the hearing on 28 August 1990, having been convened by the defence, the Court of Appeal decided not to hear him.

The court thereupon decided that a new order for R.'s appearance would be pointless. The procurator general brought forward a police officer, I., who had been involved in the investigation and asked that he be heard. The applicant's lawyer protested that the expert K. had not been heard and that the defence had no opportunity to prepare for the questioning of I.; to agree to hear I. now would prejudice the rights of the defence. The Court of Appeal nonetheless acceded to the request, and I. was heard concerning the way in which the investigation had been conducted. I. explained that from 1982 until 1988 he had been a member of a police team set up to fight drug trafficking in the centre of Amsterdam. Over the years that team had built up a good understanding with many of the drug addicts living in that area; making use of that relationship, they had asked them for information on drug dealers. Their cooperation was wholly voluntary. I. denied that the police made promises to drug addicts or put pressure on them; nor were photographs shown to addicts who had been arrested. In his assessment the statements made by drug addicts were therefore highly reliable. Moreover, action was only taken against alleged drug dealers if there were at least eight statements incriminating them. He further confirmed that it had happened in the past that convicted drug dealers, after serving their sentence, had threatened and assaulted drug addicts who had made incriminating statements against them. Although he had never known the applicant to resort to violence or threats, he did not rule out the possibility that he might do so. The defence challenged the reliability of the statements made by the various witnesses, both named and anonymous, pointing to what they considered to be inconsistencies among them. They objected particularly to the admission as evidence of the statements made by Y.15 and Y.16, on the grounds, inter alia, that both were drug addicts and that the investigating judge's record of her findings of 20 March 1990 did not contain a statement that she believed that the witnesses had been telling the truth. Relying on the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 24 May 1989 (Series A no. 154), they moreover expressed doubts as to the impartiality of the investigating judge, Judge Sm., in that as a member of the Regional Court she had taken part in the hearing of the Regional Court of 25 August 1988 and in the decisions then made.

The Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's complaint based on the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge Sm. It noted that the hearing on 25 August 1988 had been summary; the Regional Court had only considered the applicant's request to have the six anonymous witnesses examined and his request for release. During that hearing the Regional Court had not examined the substance of the applicant's case. It did not appear, nor had it been argued, that Judge Sm. had had any dealings with Y.15 and Y.16 before questioning them. An investigating judge in any case did not have to provide the same safeguards as a member of a trial court. Furthermore, no particular facts or circumstances had been suggested or had come to light warranting the conclusion that she had not been able to form an unprejudiced opinion as to the reliability of the witnesses she had examined, or that she had been biased in her examination of those witnesses.

It defined these stricter requirements in the following rule: such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who (a) is aware of the identity of the witness, and (b) has expressed, in the official record of the hearing of such a witness, his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous, and (c) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness.

It entered into force on 1 February 1994. The additions include the following. Article 226a now provides that the identity of a witness may remain secret if there is reason to believe that the disclosure of his identity may threaten his life, health, safety, family life or socio-economic existence and if the witness has made it clear that he does not wish to make any statement because of this. The decision is made by the investigating judge, who must first hear the prosecution, the defence and the witness himself. An appeal against the decision of the investigating judge lies to the trial court (Article 226b). The investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused, or of counsel, or of both, so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness; in that event, the prosecution authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either. The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness, either through the use of telecommunication or in writing (Article 226d). Article 264 now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness. If the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat, he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge (Article 280 para. 5). The statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which his detention on remand is permitted (Article 342 para. 2 (b)). A new paragraph has been added to Article 344 to the effect that a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or have him questioned.",

He emphasised, first of all, that during the first-instance proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 were questioned by an investigating judge, Judge M., in the absence of his counsel. He claimed that this was in violation of an agreement between his counsel and Judge M. (see paragraph 14 above). Although he conceded that in the course of the appeal proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 had been questioned by Investigating Judge Sm. in the presence of his counsel and had identified him from a photograph taken several years previously (see paragraph 25 above), that was not a proper substitute for a confrontation with him in person. Not knowing the identity of the persons concerned, he could not himself cross-examine them to test their credibility. Nor could the possibility of mistakes be ruled out. It would, in his submission, have been possible to examine the witnesses in his presence, protecting them, if need be, by the use of disguise, voice-distorting equipment or a two-way mirror. In fact, he questioned the need for maintaining the anonymity of Y.15 and Y.16 at all. Both had stated before the investigating judge that they feared reprisals (see paragraph 25 above) but there was nothing to suggest that they were ever subjected to, or for that matter threatened with, violence at the hands of the applicant. Moreover, the basis of the investigating judge's assessment of the need for anonymity was not made clear to the defence. He further submitted that it was inappropriate that the trial court should have accepted unquestioningly the assessment of the reliability of the evidence given by Y.15 and Y.16 to the investigating judge (see paragraphs 32 and 34 above). In this connection the applicant pointed out that both Y.15 and Y.16 were drug addicts. Y.16, on his own admission, had been an addict for no less than seventeen years. Statements by drug addicts were notoriously unreliable, as appeared from, inter alia, the statement made by the expert witness L. (see paragraph 31 above). The investigating judge had not herself carried out the complete investigation of the case, so that she could not assess the credibility of the witnesses in the light of the complete case file; furthermore, an important safeguard - namely, a complete assessment by the full trial court, which consisted of three judges of the Court of Appeal - had been lacking."

The Government contended that it had not been necessary to hear the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in open court as the hearing of witnesses by the investigating judge offered sufficient safeguards. The involvement of the investigating judge afforded the suspect the guarantee that the investigation would be impartial and objective. It was the duty of the investigating judge to collect not only evidence that tended to incriminate the suspect, but also evidence that might disculpate him. In addition, the investigating judge had the power to hear witnesses on oath, and the prosecution and the defence had the right to attend and ask questions of their own or to submit questions in writing (see paragraph 37 above and the Court's Kostovski judgment cited therein, p. 14, para. 23). They noted in addition that the applicant's counsel had twice had the opportunity to question the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in the presence of an investigating judge. The first such opportunity was on 30 May 1988, during the preliminary judicial investigation; on that occasion the lawyer had left, for reasons of his own, before these witnesses appeared (see paragraph 14 above). The second was during the appeal proceedings, on 14 February 1990 (see paragraph 25 above). On that occasion counsel had been present and had in fact put direct questions to the witnesses. Given that counsel had in fact been able to question Y.15 and Y.16 face to face, the lack of any confrontation with the applicant in person had not materially restricted the ability of the defence to cast doubt on their credibility or that of their statements or to counter their statements as it saw fit. Moreover, the investigating judge, Judge Sm., had been aware of the identity of the anonymous witnesses. She had also examined their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous - namely, fear of reprisals - and considered them well-founded. Her decision had been upheld by the Court of Appeal, which had found it established that potential witnesses in drug-using circles were in fact frequently threatened by drug dealers (see paragraph 28 above). The Court of Appeal had been entitled to consider the reliability of the statements of Y.15 and Y.16 sufficiently corroborated by the findings of the investigating judge, as officially recorded on 19 November 1990, and by the statement in open court of the police officer I. that the witnesses in the case had been under no constraint. In any case, the Court of Appeal had noted in its judgment that it had made use of the anonymous statements \"with the necessary caution and circumspection\" (see paragraph 34 above).

The defence withdrew its request to have him heard but maintained its request that the Court of Appeal should hear the six anonymous witnesses and the expert K. Referring to its decision of 10 May, the Court of Appeal refused to accede to the request of the defence to hear the six anonymous witnesses. However, in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court of 2 July 1990 (see paragraph 46 below), it decided to refer the case back to the investigating judge, requesting her to record her findings as to the reliability of the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16, adding that if in order to appraise their reliability the investigating judge found it necessary to hear them again she should do so. Although the expert K. was present at the hearing on 28 August 1990, having been convened by the defence, the Court of Appeal decided not to hear him. The reason given was that as an expert rather than a witness he could not be expected to contribute to the elucidation of the facts of the case. The witness N. was heard by the Court of Appeal in the applicant's presence and the applicant's lawyer was given the opportunity to question him. N. said that his statement to the police had been untrue and that he did not in fact know the applicant. In pursuance of the court's order of 10 May 1990 that he be brought by force, the named witness R. was present initially. It appears that before he was heard, he asked the court usher who was guarding him for permission to leave for a minute; this being allowed him, he then disappeared and could not be found again. The court subsequently ordered that he be brought before it by force at its next hearing on 22 November 1990. The Court of Appeal heard the expert L., who stated that drug addicts often made unreliable statements concerning alleged drug dealers to the police. He understood from drug addicts that police officers made promises to them and that they made statements only in order to be allowed to leave as soon as possible. Such statements were, in his view, \"somewhere between the truth and a lie\"."

She had the impression that both witnesses knew whom they were talking about and had identified the applicant's photograph without hesitation. With regard to the facts of which the applicant stood accused, her impression had been that the witnesses themselves believed their statements to be true.

The court thereupon decided that a new order for R.'s appearance would be pointless. The procurator general brought forward a police officer, I., who had been involved in the investigation and asked that he be heard. The applicant's lawyer protested that the expert K. had not been heard and that the defence had no opportunity to prepare for the questioning of I.; to agree to hear I. now would prejudice the rights of the defence. The Court of Appeal nonetheless acceded to the request, and I. was heard concerning the way in which the investigation had been conducted. I. explained that from 1982 until 1988 he had been a member of a police team set up to fight drug trafficking in the centre of Amsterdam. Over the years that team had built up a good understanding with many of the drug addicts living in that area; making use of that relationship, they had asked them for information on drug dealers. Their cooperation was wholly voluntary. I. denied that the police made promises to drug addicts or put pressure on them; nor were photographs shown to addicts who had been arrested. In his assessment the statements made by drug addicts were therefore highly reliable. Moreover, action was only taken against alleged drug dealers if there were at least eight statements incriminating them. He further confirmed that it had happened in the past that convicted drug dealers, after serving their sentence, had threatened and assaulted drug addicts who had made incriminating statements against them. Although he had never known the applicant to resort to violence or threats, he did not rule out the possibility that he might do so. The defence challenged the reliability of the statements made by the various witnesses, both named and anonymous, pointing to what they considered to be inconsistencies among them. They objected particularly to the admission as evidence of the statements made by Y.15 and Y.16, on the grounds, inter alia, that both were drug addicts and that the investigating judge's record of her findings of 20 March 1990 did not contain a statement that she believed that the witnesses had been telling the truth. Relying on the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 24 May 1989 (Series A no. 154), they moreover expressed doubts as to the impartiality of the investigating judge, Judge Sm., in that as a member of the Regional Court she had taken part in the hearing of the Regional Court of 25 August 1988 and in the decisions then made.

It also found that the reliability of the witnesses and the well- foundedness of their wish to remain anonymous had been sufficiently verified by the investigating judge. The witness N. had been heard in open court both at first instance and on appeal. Although he had retracted his earlier statement to the police, that was the statement which the Court of Appeal chose to believe in light of the testimony of the police officer I. Finally, the mere fact that the defence had not had the opportunity to question R. did not mean that his statement could not be used in evidence. The Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's complaint based on the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge Sm. It noted that the hearing on 25 August 1988 had been summary; the Regional Court had only considered the applicant's request to have the six anonymous witnesses examined and his request for release. During that hearing the Regional Court had not examined the substance of the applicant's case. It did not appear, nor had it been argued, that Judge Sm. had had any dealings with Y.15 and Y.16 before questioning them. An investigating judge in any case did not have to provide the same safeguards as a member of a trial court. Furthermore, no particular facts or circumstances had been suggested or had come to light warranting the conclusion that she had not been able to form an unprejudiced opinion as to the reliability of the witnesses she had examined, or that she had been biased in her examination of those witnesses. The applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment. The time which he had spent in police custody and detention on remand was deducted from the sentence.",

The investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused, or of counsel, or of both, so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness; in that event, the prosecution authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either. The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness, either through the use of telecommunication or in writing (Article 226d). Article 264 now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness. If the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat, he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge (Article 280 para. 5). The statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which his detention on remand is permitted (Article 342 para. 2 (b)). A new paragraph has been added to Article 344 to the effect that a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or have him questioned.",

He also raised various claims about the use made of the statements of the anonymous witnesses Y.05, Y.06, Y.13 and Y.14, about the procedure for confronting witnesses and informants with photographs of suspected drug dealers and about the fact (admitted by Y.16 himself - see paragraph 25 above) that the police had rehearsed his statement with him while taking him to see the investigating judge.

The applicant claimed in the first place that in obtaining the statements of the anonymous witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 the rights of the defence had been infringed to such an extent that the reliance on those statements by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal was incompatible with the standards of a \"fair\" trial. He emphasised, first of all, that during the first-instance proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 were questioned by an investigating judge, Judge M., in the absence of his counsel. He claimed that this was in violation of an agreement between his counsel and Judge M. (see paragraph 14 above). Although he conceded that in the course of the appeal proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 had been questioned by Investigating Judge Sm. in the presence of his counsel and had identified him from a photograph taken several years previously (see paragraph 25 above), that was not a proper substitute for a confrontation with him in person. Not knowing the identity of the persons concerned, he could not himself cross-examine them to test their credibility. Nor could the possibility of mistakes be ruled out. It would, in his submission, have been possible to examine the witnesses in his presence, protecting them, if need be, by the use of disguise, voice-distorting equipment or a two-way mirror. In fact, he questioned the need for maintaining the anonymity of Y.15 and Y.16 at all. Both had stated before the investigating judge that they feared reprisals (see paragraph 25 above) but there was nothing to suggest that they were ever subjected to, or for that matter threatened with, violence at the hands of the applicant. Moreover, the basis of the investigating judge's assessment of the need for anonymity was not made clear to the defence. He further submitted that it was inappropriate that the trial court should have accepted unquestioningly the assessment of the reliability of the evidence given by Y.15 and Y.16 to the investigating judge (see paragraphs 32 and 34 above). In this connection the applicant pointed out that both Y.15 and Y.16 were drug addicts. Y.16, on his own admission, had been an addict for no less than seventeen years. Statements by drug addicts were notoriously unreliable, as appeared from, inter alia, the statement made by the expert witness L. (see paragraph 31 above). The investigating judge had not herself carried out the complete investigation of the case, so that she could not assess the credibility of the witnesses in the light of the complete case file; furthermore, an important safeguard - namely, a complete assessment by the full trial court, which consisted of three judges of the Court of Appeal - had been lacking."

The Government contended that it had not been necessary to hear the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in open court as the hearing of witnesses by the investigating judge offered sufficient safeguards. The involvement of the investigating judge afforded the suspect the guarantee that the investigation would be impartial and objective. It was the duty of the investigating judge to collect not only evidence that tended to incriminate the suspect, but also evidence that might disculpate him. In addition, the investigating judge had the power to hear witnesses on oath, and the prosecution and the defence had the right to attend and ask questions of their own or to submit questions in writing (see paragraph 37 above and the Court's Kostovski judgment cited therein, p. 14, para. 23). They noted in addition that the applicant's counsel had twice had the opportunity to question the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in the presence of an investigating judge. The first such opportunity was on 30 May 1988, during the preliminary judicial investigation; on that occasion the lawyer had left, for reasons of his own, before these witnesses appeared (see paragraph 14 above). The second was during the appeal proceedings, on 14 February 1990 (see paragraph 25 above). On that occasion counsel had been present and had in fact put direct questions to the witnesses. Given that counsel had in fact been able to question Y.15 and Y.16 face to face, the lack of any confrontation with the applicant in person had not materially restricted the ability of the defence to cast doubt on their credibility or that of their statements or to counter their statements as it saw fit. Moreover, the investigating judge, Judge Sm., had been aware of the identity of the anonymous witnesses. She had also examined their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous - namely, fear of reprisals - and considered them well-founded. Her decision had been upheld by the Court of Appeal, which had found it established that potential witnesses in drug-using circles were in fact frequently threatened by drug dealers (see paragraph 28 above). The Court of Appeal had been entitled to consider the reliability of the statements of Y.15 and Y.16 sufficiently corroborated by the findings of the investigating judge, as officially recorded on 19 November 1990, and by the statement in open court of the police officer I. that the witnesses in the case had been under no constraint. In any case, the Court of Appeal had noted in its judgment that it had made use of the anonymous statements \"with the necessary caution and circumspection\" (see paragraph 34 above).

This is certainly a relevant reason to allow them anonymity. It remains to be seen whether it was sufficient. Although, as the applicant has stated, there has been no suggestion that Y.15 and Y.16 were ever threatened by the applicant himself, the decision to maintain their anonymity cannot be regarded as unreasonable per se. Regard must be had to the fact, as established by the domestic courts and not contested by the applicant, that drug dealers frequently resorted to threats or actual violence against persons who gave evidence against them (see paragraph 28 above). Furthermore, the statements made by the witnesses concerned to the investigating judge show that one of them had apparently on a previous occasion suffered violence at the hands of a drug dealer against whom he had testified, while the other had been threatened (see paragraph 25 above).

In this instance, even though the judicial authorities did not, as would have been preferable, organise a confrontation between all the accused during the twenty months preceding G.V. ’ s tragic death, they cannot be held responsible for the latter event. Furthermore, in its judgment of 6 April 1991, the Juvenile Section of the Caltanisetta Court of Appeal carried out a detailed analysis of the prosecution witness ’ s statements and found them to be corroborated by a series of other items of evidence, such as the fact that all the accused had made statements implicating each other, the fact that the applicants had helped G.V. to buy and to transport the two gas bottles used in the attack on the barracks and the lack of a convincing alibi for either of the accused (see paragraph 30 above)."

The state of shock observed on their arrival at the prison was attributed to a lack of sleep and the lengthy interrogation.

Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for effecting a lawful arrest, but force may only be used if it is indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, § 63, 12 April 2007 with further references; and Peleckas v. Lithuania ( dec .), no. 18293/03, 6 November 2007). Recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person ’ s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. In order to fall within the scope of Article 3, the ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity, the assessment of which depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among others, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162 ). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Zelilof v. Greece, no. 17060/03, § 44, 24 May 2007 )."

At the trial he pleaded that the police officers had forcibly pinned him to the ground, handcuffed him and beat him up. As can be seen from the medical report submitted by the applicant, after the arrest he had a bruise on his left shin and an injury to his left shoulder (see paragraph 6 above). While the Court does not exclude that the applicant could have sustained them during the arrest, no sufficient and cogent elements have been provided which could support the applicant ’ s allegation of police brutality. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant ’ s complaint is sufficiently substantiated. Overall, the Court has doubts as to whether in the circumstances of the case the use of force by the police was excessive and whether the applicant ’ s resulting injuries reached the level of severity required under Article 3. Finally, the Court notes that the parties made no submissions as regards the advancement of the investigation after its resumption in 2005.

Article 6 § 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused ’ s behalf; its essential aim, as indicated by the words “under the same conditions”, is full equality of arms in the matter (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to the defence rights (see Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, § 55, 22 June 2006 ). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, § 41, 18 May 2004, and Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89)."

Without denying the probable effectiveness of adducing an alibi defence at the stage of a preliminary investigation, the Court observes that the Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time, required a trial judge to determine who should be called as witnesses (see paragraph 19 above). Thus, it does not appear that the applicant was barred from making a request for witnesses during the trial, which he actually did on several occasions. The Court considers that the Government ’ s argument, as presented, to the effect that the applicant had not objected to concluding the trial proceedings in the absence of the witnesses is devoid of any substance. Accordingly, the Court does not need to examine it."

It has not been claimed that the applicant ’ s request for defence witnesses was vexatious or that he made no reasonable effort to obtain their attendance, for instance, by omitting to provide their full names and addresses. There is no doubt that the request was sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject - matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the defence position or even led to the applicant ’ s acquittal (see, in this respect, Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, § 29, ECHR 2003-V, and Guilloury, cited above, § 64; Dorokhov v. Russia, no. 66802/01, § 74, 14 February 2008 ).

In that connection, it is observed that under Russian law, in force at the material time, an application to call additional witnesses or adduce evidence should have been granted in all cases and a refusal to grant it should have been given in a reasoned decision ( see paragraph 19 above ). It appears that no such decision was issued. Neither did the trial judgment contain any reasoning to that effect.

Thus, the Court considers that in circumstances where the applicant ’ s conviction was based primarily on the assumption of his being in a particular place at a particular time, the right to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf and the principle of equality of arms, which are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial, imply that he should have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to challenge the assumption effectively (see, mutatis mutandis, Popov v.

The Court, like the Commission, considers that in this case the Tribunal de Corts, which pronounced the conviction of Mr Drozd and Mr Janousek, is the \"competent court\" referred to in Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a). As the Convention does not require the Contracting Parties to impose its standards on third States or territories, France was not obliged to verify whether the proceedings which resulted in the conviction were compatible with all the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. To require such a review of the manner in which a court not bound by the Convention had applied the principles enshrined in Article 6 (art. 6) would also thwart the current trend towards strengthening international cooperation in the administration of justice, a trend which is in principle in the interests of the persons concerned. The Contracting States are, however, obliged to refuse their co-operation if it emerges that the conviction is the result of a flagrant denial of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 45, para. 113).",

It finds confirmation of this assurance in the decisions of some French courts: certain indictments divisions refuse to allow extradition of a person who has been convicted in his absence in a country where it is not possible for him to be retried on surrendering to justice (see, for example, the decision of the Limoges Court of Appeal, 15 May 1979, cited in the Bozano v.

If they were still serving judges, the Ministry of Justice placed them at the disposal of the French Co-Prince, who then proceeded to appoint them. More generally, the practice of seconding officials belonged to a long French tradition of judicial cooperation - in particular with Monaco and with African States - and of the independence of the judges in question with respect to their country of origin.

It merely notes that the Tribunal de Corts followed the procedure laid down by Andorran law, not by the French Code of Criminal Procedure, passed sentences provided for in Andorran legislation and not in the French Criminal Code, and pronounced a judgment which could not be appealed against before the French Court of Cassation.",

The Franco-Andorran custom referred to above, dating back several centuries, has sufficient stability and legal force to serve as a basis for the detention in issue, notwithstanding the particular status of the Principality in international law. Moreover, there is no reason to doubt that the said detention was in accordance with the procedures prescribed by French law, especially as the applicants did not challenge before the French courts the validity of the custom in question and the corresponding provisions of French law.",

The Government argued that a distinction should be drawn between the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the lawfulness of the conviction from the point of view of Article 6 (art. 6); the former could be assessed only by reference to the internal law of the country of detention. If the authorities of that country were obliged to assure themselves of the latter, in the case of a trial which had taken place abroad, the result would be to make the transfer of prisoners extremely difficult, or even impossible. It would also have a paradoxical effect, in that, as it would not be possible to retry the defendant in the receiving country, it would have to be left to the country which had been found responsible for breaching the Convention to enforce the sentence itself. Besides, the Principality would itself have to accommodate the prisoners who are now in France and Spain, and would thus have to provide itself with the appropriate institutions and personnel.",
                "In any event, the French Code of Criminal Procedure did provide for an administrative and - to a certain extent - judicial review of the transfer. This safeguard was more than a mere formality, since if the sentence imposed abroad was more severe in its nature or extent than that provided for in French law, the criminal court would, if the matter were referred to it by the public prosecutor or the convicted person, substitute the corresponding penalty in French law.",

If they were still serving judges, the Ministry of Justice placed them at the disposal of the French Co-Prince, who then proceeded to appoint them. More generally, the practice of seconding officials belonged to a long French tradition of judicial cooperation - in particular with Monaco and with African States - and of the independence of the judges in question with respect to their country of origin. Moreover, the Higher Court of Perpignan (see paragraph 66 above) was not a de facto French civil court, as it had a different composition from that of a French court and did not apply French law or follow French procedure.",

The Court, in agreement with the Commission, finds that the aim of the remedies in question is to obtain compensation for damage caused by deprivation of liberty and to impose sanctions on public officials. While they may have the indirect effect of putting an end to a person ’ s detention, they have not hitherto brought about such a result where the detention originates from a decision by an Andorran court. In such cases, as the Government themselves pointed out before the Commission, the French courts do not regard themselves as having jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of criminal convictions pronounced in the Principality.",

It had continued without interruption since then, and until the present case had never been challenged. It was indeed of a bilateral and local character, and admittedly linked a State with an entity which did not have legal personality in international law, but it nevertheless constituted a compulsory rule which created reciprocal rights and obligations.",
                "As for French law, it included a law, no. 84-1150 of 21 December 1984, on the transfer to France of persons convicted and imprisoned abroad, and this law had inserted into the Code of Criminal Procedure the new Articles 713-1 to 713-8. Although the only hypothesis mentioned was an \"international convention or agreement\", it also applied in the case of a custom. It was fleshed out by instructions to prison establishments issued by the Minister of Justice.",

For reasons similar to those set out in paragraphs 89 and 96 above, the Court considers that it does not have jurisdiction to review the observance of Andorran legal procedures, or more generally to review the lawfulness of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty in terms of the laws of the Principality. It merely notes that the Tribunal de Corts followed the procedure laid down by Andorran law, not by the French Code of Criminal Procedure, passed sentences provided for in Andorran legislation and not in the French Criminal Code, and pronounced a judgment which could not be appealed against before the French Court of Cassation.",

The Franco-Andorran custom referred to above, dating back several centuries, has sufficient stability and legal force to serve as a basis for the detention in issue, notwithstanding the particular status of the Principality in international law. Moreover, there is no reason to doubt that the said detention was in accordance with the procedures prescribed by French law, especially as the applicants did not challenge before the French courts the validity of the custom in question and the corresponding provisions of French law.",

The Government argued that a distinction should be drawn between the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the lawfulness of the conviction from the point of view of Article 6 (art. 6); the former could be assessed only by reference to the internal law of the country of detention. If the authorities of that country were obliged to assure themselves of the latter, in the case of a trial which had taken place abroad, the result would be to make the transfer of prisoners extremely difficult, or even impossible. It would also have a paradoxical effect, in that, as it would not be possible to retry the defendant in the receiving country, it would have to be left to the country which had been found responsible for breaching the Convention to enforce the sentence itself. Besides, the Principality would itself have to accommodate the prisoners who are now in France and Spain, and would thus have to provide itself with the appropriate institutions and personnel.",
                "In any event, the French Code of Criminal Procedure did provide for an administrative and - to a certain extent - judicial review of the transfer. This safeguard was more than a mere formality, since if the sentence imposed abroad was more severe in its nature or extent than that provided for in French law, the criminal court would, if the matter were referred to it by the public prosecutor or the convicted person, substitute the corresponding penalty in French law.",

The Court, like the Commission, considers that in this case the Tribunal de Corts, which pronounced the conviction of Mr Drozd and Mr Janousek, is the \"competent court\" referred to in Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a). As the Convention does not require the Contracting Parties to impose its standards on third States or territories, France was not obliged to verify whether the proceedings which resulted in the conviction were compatible with all the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. To require such a review of the manner in which a court not bound by the Convention had applied the principles enshrined in Article 6 (art. 6) would also thwart the current trend towards strengthening international cooperation in the administration of justice, a trend which is in principle in the interests of the persons concerned. The Contracting States are, however, obliged to refuse their co-operation if it emerges that the conviction is the result of a flagrant denial of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 45, para. 113).",

It finds confirmation of this assurance in the decisions of some French courts: certain indictments divisions refuse to allow extradition of a person who has been convicted in his absence in a country where it is not possible for him to be retried on surrendering to justice (see, for example, the decision of the Limoges Court of Appeal, 15 May 1979, cited in the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 10, para. 18), and the Conseil d ’ État has declared the extradition of persons liable to the death penalty on the territory of the requesting State to be incompatible with French public policy (see, for instance, the Fidan judgment of 27 February 1987, with submissions by Government Commissioner Jean-Claude Bonichot, Recueil Dalloz Sirey 1987, jurisprudence, pp. 305-310, and the Gacem judgment of 14 December 1987, Recueil Lebon 1987, tables, p. 733).",
