However, having regard to fact that for the most part of their detention they had less than 3 square metres of personal space inside their cell for almost the entire day and night, the Court considers that the distress and hardship endured by the applicants exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3 and therefore amounted to degrading treatment. In view of these findings, the Court does not find it necessary to undertake the fact-finding measures suggested by the Government (see paragraph 70 above) as these measures would not be able to alter the above conclusion.",

The objective of the 2006 follow-up visit to the Ljubljana Prison was to examine measures taken by the Slovenian authorities aimed to implement the CPT ’ s recommendations with respect to remand prisoners.

Prisoners continued to be accommodated under cramped conditions, with generally five persons in 18 m² cells and two persons in cells measuring 8 m² (including the sanitary annexe). Naturally, this situation had negative repercussions for all aspects of life, both for prisoners and staff.

Regrettably, the situation observed in 2006 was hardly any different. The only positive developments concerned increased access to the recreation room (one-hour sessions three times a week) and the installation of a table tennis table in the exercise yard. Only five prisoners were provided with work and two had access to education.

On the contrary, persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Under Article 3 the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Valašinas, cited above, § 102, and Kudła v.

Such elements included, in particular, the availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements and the possibility of using the toilet in private. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of 3 to 4 square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Ostrovar v.

The applicants alleged that six inmates were held in the cell. The Government, while acknowledging that there were six sleeping places in the cell, stated that the number of inmates varied between five and six but provided no official documents to demonstrate that during the period of the applicants ’ detention fewer then six inmates were held in their cell. In this connection, the Court notes that the overcrowding in the prison in question has been acknowledged by the prison authorities. During the relevant period the occupancy of the prison twice exceeded its official capacity (see paragraph 44 above). The situation was particularly serious as regards remand prisoners (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). The Court therefore finds that even if occasionally they were afforded a little more than 3 square metres of personal space, the applicants were at least for a significant part of their detention held in a cell in which the personal space available to them was 2.7 square metres, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cell. This state of affairs in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sulejmanovic, cited above, §§ 43 and 44, and Modarca v.

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant ’ s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman ’ s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above).

The sanitary annex was attached to the cell and was constantly at the disposal of the prisoners accommodated in the cell. They were also allowed to shower once a day in a shower room which contained partitions between the shower heads. It further observes that the sanitary annex contained a functioning ventilation system. While it can accept that the sanitary conditions might have been affected by the fact that the facilities were overcrowded, the Court does not find on the basis of the material before it that the cleanliness of the relevant areas of the prison was inadequate vis-à-vis the Convention standards."

However, having regard to fact that for the most part of their detention they had less than 3 square metres of personal space inside their cell for almost the entire day and night, the Court considers that the distress and hardship endured by the applicants exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3 and therefore amounted to degrading treatment.

However, it is an essential part of a detainee ’ s right to respect for his family life that the authorities enable him or, if need be, help him to maintain contact with his close family. Such restrictions as limitations imposed on the number of family visits, supervision of those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visiting arrangements constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision. Nevertheless, any restriction of that kind must be applied “in accordance with the law”, must pursue one or more of the legitimate aims listed in paragraph 2 and, in addition, must be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see, among other authorities, Moiseyev v.

In so far as the applicants may be understood as complaining that their contact with other people by telephone or visits was restricted more than was required by the legislation, while noting that certain concerns in this area were raised by the CPT after its visit in 2006 (see paragraph 43 above), the Court finds that the applicants have not submitted any evidence or concrete information which would indicate that they were unable to use the facilities in question in accordance with the law.

For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres.

It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation on the Execution of Sentence and was therefore in breach of the claimant ’ s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant ’ s personal rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table and to use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations.

The Court notes that it is clear from the above provisions as well as from the court orders submitted by the Government (see paragraph 97 above) that the request for the transfer of a prisoner could only have been made by the prison governor. This remedy was therefore not directly accessible to the applicants and could not be considered effective. Moreover, the Court observes that the prison authorities were aware of the overcrowding in the remand section of the prison (see paragraphs 44 ‑ 4 8 above). In 2010 they put in place a system whereby a request for transfer would be made when the number of prisoners exceeded 245 (see paragraph 46 above). It was therefore up to the prison authorities, and not the applicants, to make use of this remedy had they considered it effective.",

These provisions refer to the termination of an “act” or “action” infringing human rights when no other judicial protection is available (see paragraph 34 above). In support of their argument, the Government referred to past decisions of the Administrative Court. However, those decisions arose from situations which do not even remotely relate to that of the applicants (see paragraph 99 above). The Court moreover notes that the claim under the first paragraph of section 4 is conditional on a number of elements, one of them being that the result of the action is unlawful hindrance, limitation or prevention of the enjoyment of a human right and another being the absence of any other judicial protection (see paragraph 35 above). It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of prison conditions. The Court would limit itself to observing that it is unaware of any decision that would demonstrate that a claim concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons could be brought directly to the Administrative Court with any prospect of putting a timely end to an alleged violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 57, 19 June 2007, and Belinger v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 42320/98, 2 October 2001)."

While it is not for the Court to give a ruling on an issue of domestic law that is as yet unsettled the absence of any case-law does indicate the uncertainty of these remedies in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Horvat v.

They did not subsequently institute any civil proceedings for compensation under section 179 of the Civil Code. The Government argued that had they done so they could have been successful. In this connection, the Government submitted a number of court decisions which do not relate to inadequate conditions of detention. Subsequently, they submitted to the court a recent judgment of 9 May 2011 in which a local court found that the claimant ’ s personal rights as well as the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degradation treatment was violated on account of inadequate conditions in Ljubljana prison. It awarded the claimant compensation for non-pecuniary damage."

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts. Therefore, as things stand, the civil claim for compensation cannot be considered to be sufficiently certain in practice as regards compensation claimed in respect of allegedly inadequate prison conditions.",

A ruling of a civil court cannot, however, have any impact on general prison conditions because it cannot address the root cause of the problem. For that reason, the Court would, in addition to the measures aimed at reducing the occupancy level in cells in Ljubljana prison, encourage the State to develop an effective instrument which would provide a speedy reaction to complaints concerning inadequate conditions of detention and ensure that, when necessary, a transfer of a detainee is ordered to Convention compatible conditions (see Orchowski, cited above, § 154).",

In the final analysis, the Court takes the view that the applicant ’ s continued detention is not in itself incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, but that the national authorities have not provided him with the care required to avoid subjecting him to treatment contrary to that provision. In view of his severe disability and the fact that he suffers from urinary and faecal incontinence, the length of time during which he was detained without receiving any rehabilitative treatment, and his inability to take a shower without the help of a fellow prisoner, are factors that have subjected the applicant to hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention.

This level of dependency and the problems associated with his incontinence complicated his relationship with the orderly. Going to the shower was a stressful time because the structure did not shield him from the view of others and his incontinence exposed him to extremely humiliating situations, causing irritation or even hostility on the part of his fellow inmates, who were unwilling to put up with such inconvenience in the course of their personal hygiene activities."

The management had refused to give the slightest undertaking about the conditions in which he would be accommodated in Roanne and the care he could be given there. They had been unable to provide any guarantees as to care arrangements as there were six cells for disabled prisoners at that facility and they were all occupied, and a single physiotherapist came to the prison for four half-days a week to provide services for five hundred prisoners. The applicant contended that he had not applied for a transfer on the grounds that the prison in question did not offer appropriate care facilities and would simply have represented a further upheaval and ordeal for him following his repeated moves from one prison to another ( twelve transfers between 2002 and 2009).

Examining the provision in question, the Court of Cassation specified in a judgment of 28 September 2005 ( Criminal Division, 05-81.010) that the convicted prisoner ’ s condition necessarily required a poor short-term prognosis. In a judgment of 7 January 2009 (Criminal Division, 08-83364) the Court of Cassation held that in rejecting an application by a disabled prisoner for the suspension of his sentence, the Post-Sentencing Division of the Amiens Court of Appeal had not justified its decision on the basis of Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since it had not determined, as the applicant ’ s submissions had invited it to do, whether the two expert opinions indicated that the actual conditions of his detention were incompatible in the long term with his state of health.

The question concerned the alleged interference with the ordinary courts ’ duty to protect personal liberty in so far as they were bound by the medical experts ’ two concurring opinions; the fact that the measure could be granted only if there was no serious risk of reoffending; and the lack of clarity of the provision in terms of respect for human dignity. The Criminal Division found that the question raised had no serious merit, for the following reasons :",

In his annual activity report for 2012 the Inspector General of Detention Facilities ( contrôleur général des lieux de privation de liberté – CGLPL) included a chapter on “ old age, invalidity and disability in prison ”, in which he noted that people in these categories were excluded by the very nature of prison architecture and the organisation of everyday prison life. He explained that cells for prisoners with reduced mobility were often located on the ground floor, which was normally set aside for prisoners under the “closed doors” regime; this was not conducive to any communication. The daily routine was a further source of anxiety : “ fear of being confronted with violence, fear of a primarily young population, fear of going to the exercise yard. Boredom too, since an occupational activity is no longer accessible to them and the activities available are unsuited to their physical condition. And finally, the humiliation of being dependent. Although many facilities have signed agreements with associations providing personal assistance, there are still too many prisons where the duties of ‘ attendant ’ or domestic help are performed by other prisoners employed by the prison management – the ‘ prison orderlies ’; this situation is unacceptable on account of the risks of blackmail and the lack of appropriate training and remuneration .”",

He also recommended that “ the suspension of sentences on medical grounds be better adapted to the reality of the situations it may cover”. Among the targets of his criticism in that respect were the restrictive conditions laid down in Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which the execution of a sentence could be suspended only in extremely serious cases and as a short-term measure. He added : “ It must be noted that the experts assigned to assess whether the prisoner ’ s health is compatible with continued detention do not take sufficient account of the physical conditions of incarceration, quite simply because they are entirely unaware of the constraints it entails ”. He recommended that Parliament amend Article 720-1-1 “ to introduce a third possible criterion besides the risk to life and the long-term incompatibility of the prisoner ’ s health with detention, namely granting a request for suspension of a sentence where the treatment required by the prisoner cannot be provided either in detention or even during periods of ordinary or escorted prison leave, because of its repetitive and regular nature ”."

It is recommended that the experts be provided with all possible means in order to determine whether the prisoner ’ s health is compatible with the conditions of ordinary detention.

France (no. 33834/03, § 29, 11 July 2006) for the provisions governing health care in prison. It should be noted that health care for prisoners has been the responsibility of the public hospital service since the Law of 18 January 1994 came into force. Outside appointments and emergency and short-term hospital admissions take place at the hospital to which the UCSA – an internal unit of the hospital based in the detention facility – is attached. Any treatment that is unavailable at the UCSA is provided either at the local hospital or in one of the eight secure interregional hospital units ( unités hospitalières sécurisées interrégionales – UHSI) or the National Public Health Institution in Fresnes (EPSNF). The UHSIs are responsible for providing medical and surgical treatment for detainees referred by UCSA medical personnel for stays of more than forty-eight hours. The EPSNF has medical, aftercare and rehabilitation departments and admits prisoners whose health requires an extended hospital stay or major therapy ( see Guide du prisonnier (Prisoner ’ s handbook), OIP, 2012, section on “ La médecine générale ” ). In its 2014 annual report the Court of Audit included a chapter entitled “ Detainees ’ health: further progress still essential”, in which it outlined the arrangements for admitting detainees to hospital and noted, among other things, the “ poor take-up of somatic hospital capacity ”, and especially the under -occupation of the UHSIs. The report also mentions “ an approach to health care that is all too often dependent on the operation of the prison system ”, and concludes that “ in addition to the rigidity and constraints of the prison environment, the available treatment is still inadequate, the need for more modern premises and equipment is not satisfied and the forms of cooperation between the parties concerned are fragile and incomplete ”. Furthermore, it calls for “ the development of a stronger and clearer public ‑ health policy ” through the assistance of regional health agencies, which “ assess and identify detainees ’ health-care needs.

The Government ’ s position was all the more unacceptable as the courts in question had merely examined the most immediately visible aspects of his situation, namely the configuration of the premises and the treatment available to detainees. Referring to the reports by the CGLPL and the Justice/Health Interministerial Working Group mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, he submitted that the competent authorities ’ assessment of dignity was limited to the question of the provision of care rather than covering practical living conditions. However, his state of complete dependence on the prison orderly, the conditions in which he took a shower, the security measures imposed on him whenever he was escorted outside the prison and the full body searches all amounted to repeated humiliation undermining his personality. All these measures had been found to be inhuman and degrading by the Court ( the applicant cited Vincent v. France, no. 6253/03, 24 October 2006; Khider v.

Relying on Gülay Çetin v.

The intensity of the ordeal inflicted on a person with disabilities amounted to disregarding the purposes of the sentence, instead turning it into pure retribution and an indiscriminate punishment.

These obligations are set out very clearly in Xiros v. Greece ( no. 1 033/07, § 73, 9 September 2010; for a more recent authority, see Ürfi Çetinkaya v. Turkey, no. 1 9866/04, §§ 87 - 92, 23 July 2013) and may be summarised as follows."

Although this cannot be construed as a general obligation to release detainees or transfer them to a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat, the Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies in the form of humanitarian measures. Accordingly, in exceptional cases where the state of a detainee ’ s health is absolutely incompatible with his or her detention, Article 3 may require the release of that person under certain conditions ( see Xiros, cited above, § 74).",
                "As regards the second obligation, the lack of appropriate medical care may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court requires, firstly, the provision of relevant medical support for sick detainees and appropriate medical treatment for their specific ailments. The promptness and frequency with which medical care is provided to such prisoners are two factors to be taken into account in assessing whether they are being treated in a manner compatible with the requirements of Article 3. In particular, these two factors are not assessed by the Court in absolute terms, but with due regard for the prisoner ’ s particular state of health in each case. In general, the worsening of the prisoner ’ s health does not in itself play a decisive role as regards observance of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court examines in each case whether the deterioration of the prisoner ’ s health was attributable to inadequacies in the medical care provided ( ibid., § 75).",

One of them pointed out in his conclusions that physiotherapy could not be provided at Uzerche Prison ( see paragraph 10 above ). The post-sentencing courts subsequently found that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions for having the execution of his sentence suspended, while taking care to note that the prison where he was detained was not suited to his circumstances. The Court of Cassation declared the applicant ’ s subsequent appeal points of law inadmissible."

            [
                "55. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court observes that it has not been ruled out that the applicant could receive physiotherapy in a prison setting ( contrast Cara-Damiani, cited above, § 74). The Court observes that the applicant ’ s disability was taken into account in the assessment of his application for suspension of his sentence, which was rejected on the basis of concurring medical opinions concluding that his condition was not incompatible in the long term with detention provided that he was given physiotherapy and access to a gym. In addition, the courts found that Uzerche Prison manifestly failed to satisfy the requirements for the applicant ’ s detention regime, in terms of both the premises and the availability of paramedical care ( see paragraphs 11 and 13 above ). The Court notes in that connection the developments in domestic law and in the positions taken by official bodies as to the need to take account of disabilities when considering applications for the suspension of sentences ( see paragraphs 27, 28, 29 and 30 above ). Lastly, it observes that it does not appear from the case file that the applicant ’ s health has deteriorated during his detention or that his disability has worsened as a result of the detention conditions. In particular, the report on the visit to Uzerche Prison by the CGLPL ( see paragraph 33 above ), which does not deal specifically with the situation for people with disabilities, does not suggest that the conditions there are such as render the applicant ’ s continued detention incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, should the applicant ’ s health deteriorate, French law affords him the opportunity to submit a fresh application to have his sentence suspended on medical grounds, a process that Parliament has recently relaxed with a view to making it easier to use ( see paragraphs 27 and 28 above ).",
                "Accordingly, the present case does not concern the question of the applicant ’ s fitness to serve his sentence, but rather the quality of the care provided, and in particular whether the national authorities did everything that could reasonably be expected of them to provide him with the rehabilitative treatment he needed and to offer him some prospect of an improvement in his condition."

On this specific point, no substantiated arguments have been submitted to the Court, in particular regarding the reason given by the appropriate authorities for refusing to allow the applicant to purchase such a device himself, which he is apparently in a position to do ( see paragraphs 16 and 22 above ) in the absence of any complaints on his part as to whether the device could be covered by the social-security system ( contrast, for example, V.D. v. Romania, no. 7078/02, §§ 94- 96, 16 February 2010). In view of these circumstances, the Court is unable to adopt a position on this point."

                "57. With regard to the physiotherapy prescribed by all the doctors who examined the applicant, the Court observes that they unanimously recommended daily rehabilitation sessions and access to a gym. However, the applicant did not receive any paramedical care of this kind until September 2012 – that is, for a period of more than three years following his admission to Uzerche Prison – on account of the lack of qualified staff at the institution. It was also very difficult for him to go to the gym since it was not wheelchair accessible, as the Government explained. The Court would note that the application for suspension of the applicant ’ s sentence was refused subject to his receiving appropriate physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, and that the domestic courts pointed out on that occasion that such treatment could not be provided at Uzerche Prison, but in other custodial facilities ( see paragraphs 11 and 13 above ). The UCSA doctors emphasised that the applicant ’ s rehabilitation should take place in a specialist environment ( see paragraph 21 above ). The Court is not in a position to assess whether an ordinary prison without admission to hospital (see paragraph 31 above) would constitute an appropriate setting, but it must ascertain whether measures were taken by the prison authorities to offer the applicant the treatment prescribed by the doctors."

According to the information supplied by the Government, the interregional director of the Prison Service repeatedly called upon the appropriate health-care authorities to remedy the deficiencies in the provision of physiotherapy at the prison ( see paragraph 17 above ), but it has to be noted that her appeal went unheeded for more than three years. The Court observes that while the responsibility for ensuring the presence of a physiotherapist at the prison lies with a separate authority from the Prison Service, this cannot justify such a lengthy period of inaction and on no account releases the State from its duties towards the applicant.",
                "The Court further observes that the Government have not shown that any effort was made to find a solution whereby the applicant could be transferred to another prison or a specialist setting. It cannot accept the Government ’ s argument that the failure to transfer the applicant to such a facility, in particular to Roanne Prison, was entirely his own fault. Admittedly, the applicant ’ s assertion that it would not have possible to provide him with the necessary treatment in that prison can only be regarded as speculation; the parties ’ observations on this issue differ considerably since they referred to the situation at that prison at different times ( see paragraphs 25 and 26 above ). It is likewise true that the applicant did not formally request a transfer but decided against doing so, firstly in June 2010 because, according to the Government, his “main motivation related to the previous decisions of the judicial authorities on requests for suspension of sentences, rather than to the treatment he might receive”, and then in August 2011, for unclear reasons ( see paragraph 26 above ). However, the Court does not consider that this attitude amounted to a refusal of treatment : it notes that in August 2011 the applicant was awaiting the outcome of his court application to have his sentence suspended, which might explain why he did not make any requests to the prison authorities at that time. Furthermore, although Article D. 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that prisoners may request a transfer to another custodial facility more suited to their medical condition, it provides above all that the responsibility for such a transfer lies with the interregional director of the Prison Service, who is to order “ any transfer ... with the aim of enabling a sick prisoner to receive treatment in more favourable conditions ” ( see paragraph 32 above ). However, it does not appear from the case file that any specific measures were taken during that entire period or that any efforts were made to allow the applicant to undergo physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, despite the repeated recommendations of the UCSA doctors that he be provided with care in a specialist setting ( see paragraph 21 above ). The attitude of the applicant, who was apparently reluctant to seek a transfer for reasons including the distance from his family (see paragraph 25 above), cannot in itself justify the inaction of the prison and health-care authorities in failing to cooperate ( see paragraph 31 above ) to provide him with the care deemed necessary by the doctors who had examined him. The Court further notes that the physiotherapy he has received since September 2012 is limited to one weekly fifteen-minute session ( see paragraph 21 above ).",

Uzerche Prison has a cell for disabled prisoners on the ground floor, near the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit, the canteen, the visiting rooms, the route to the exercise yard, and the socio-educational sector. The Court observes that it has not received any complaints from the applicant about the layout of his cell, which is wheelchair accessible ( contrast Vincent cited above, §§ 101 and 102). Nor has the applicant indicated that he has suffered any hardship in moving around the different wings of the prison, which the Court notes is equipped with a lift that he can use where necessary ( contrast Arutyunyan v. Russia, no. 4 8977/09, §§ 78-79, 10 January 2012). Although it does not appear from the case file that the applicant often leaves his cell, the Court cannot infer from his observations any specific problems attaining the level of severity required for Article 3 to be applicable as far as his movements around the facility are concerned, including access to outdoor exercise."

                "61. Firstly, with regard to the body searches and security measures which the applicant was required to undergo whenever he was transferred to hospital, the Court points out that he did not complain about this issue in his initial application, raising it only in his observations, to which the Government responded by providing additional information about the frequency of and reasons for such transfers ( see paragraph 20 above ). It has already acknowledged that measures of this kind may reach the minimum level of severity required by Article 3 to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment ( see Khider, cited above; El Shennawy v. France, no. 51246/08, 20 January 2011; and Duval, cited above ), but it does not consider that this level has been attained in the present case; the Government ’ s additional observations on this issue indicate that the applicant was not searched systematically but on specific occasions during his detention, some of which concerned all prisoners at the facility. Moreover, only two decisions ordering searches when the applicant was escorted from the prison for medical reasons have been produced to the Court. Having regard to the reasons given by the Government to justify these occasional measures ( see paragraph 20 above ), which were not always aimed at the applicant alone, the Court considers that, despite their arduous nature, they do not appear to have attained the requisite level of severity for Article 3 to be applicable. The Court observes in this connection that the conditions and procedures complained of in relation to the transfers and searches of the applicant are not comparable to those observed in other similar cases ( see Duval and El Shenawy, cited above; Mouisel, cited above, §§ 46 and 47; and Hénaf v. France, no. 65436/01, §§ 54 - 58, ECHR 2003 - XI)."

            [
                "62. Secondly, as regards access to the sanitary facilities, and more specifically the showers, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaint is that since there are no such facilities in his cell, he is unable to go there unaided but is dependent on the assistance of a fellow inmate, a situation that exposes him to humiliation vis-à-vis the prison orderly in question and other prisoners on account of his incontinence. The Court does not have any information about the precise situation regarding the showers or the frequency with which the applicant can use them. However, it has not been disputed by the Government that he is unable to go there on his own ( see paragraph 23 above ) and that they are not designed to be accessible to people with reduced mobility. It can also be inferred from the applicant ’ s condition that the prisoner responsible for assisting him on a day-to-day basis according to the Government (see paragraph 42 above) has to help him to get washed. This state of affairs, where the showers are not wheelchair accessible and the applicant has to rely on a prison orderly to get washed, has been deemed unacceptable by the CGLPL ( see paragraph 29 above ). Furthermore, while legislation passed in 2009 made it possible for any prisoners with disabilities to designate a helper of their choice ( see paragraph 32 above ), the Court observes that a measure of this kind, assuming that the conditions governing such a choice have been satisfied in the present case, is not sufficient to meet the applicant ’ s needs, since having a shower is an uncomfortable occasion for him in view of his incontinence, the lack of privacy and the role of the prisoner designated to assist him ( see, mutatis mutandis, D.G. v. Poland, cited above, § 177). Indeed, it does not appear from the evidence before the Court that such assistance complements the care provided to the applicant by health-care professionals, or that the prisoner designated to assist him has received the necessary training to perform the actions required to accompany a disabled person. The Court observes in this connection that it has held on several occasions that assistance from a fellow inmate, even on a voluntary basis, does not mean that an applicant ’ s special needs are satisfied and that the State has on that account discharged its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. It has pointed out that it could not endorse a situation where prison staff evade their safety obligations and duty of care towards the most vulnerable prisoners by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with day-to-day assistance or, where appropriate, emergency care; such a situation gives rise to anxiety and places the prisoner in a position of inferiority vis-à-vis the other prisoners ( see Farbtuhs, cited above, § 60, and D.G. v. Poland, cited above, § 147)."

            [
                "63. In the final analysis, the Court takes the view that the applicant ’ s continued detention is not in itself incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, but that the national authorities have not provided him with the care required to avoid subjecting him to treatment contrary to that provision. In view of his severe disability and the fact that he suffers from urinary and faecal incontinence, the length of time during which he was detained without receiving any rehabilitative treatment, and his inability to take a shower without the help of a fellow prisoner, are factors that have subjected the applicant to hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. Those circumstances amount to degrading treatment and thus to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The absence of any indication that the authorities acted with the intention of humiliating or debasing the applicant does not alter that finding in any way ( see Farbtuhs, cited above, §§ 50 and 60).",

The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. The domestic law must afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such use of personal data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees of this Article (see, mutatis mutandis, Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95). The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored; and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector).

                "“... [F] ingerprints and DNA profiles reveal only limited personal information. The physical samples potentially contain very much greater and more personal and detailed information. The anxiety is that science may one day enable analysis of samples to go so far as to obtain information in relation to an individual ’ s propensity to commit certain crime and be used for that purpose within the language of the present section [ section 82 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]. It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section. It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow. So, it is said, the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why cannot the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples?",
                "The answer to [these] points is as I see it as follows. First the retention of samples permits ( a) the checking of the integrity and future utility of the DNA database system; (b) a reanalysis for the upgrading of DNA profiles where new technology can improve the discriminating power of the DNA matching process; (c) reanalysis and thus an ability to extract other DNA markers and thus offer benefits in terms of speed, sensitivity and cost of searches of the database; (d) further analysis in investigations of alleged miscarriages of justice; and (e) further analysis so as to be able to identify any analytical or process errors. It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by Liberty. In relation to those risks, the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed. In my view thus the risks identified are not great, and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime. ”"

Lord Steyn, giving the lead judgment, noted the legislative history of section 64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), in particular the way in which it had been introduced by Parliament following public disquiet about the previous law, which had provided that where a person was not prosecuted or was acquitted of offences, the sample had to be destroyed and the information could not be used. In two cases, compelling DNA evidence linking one suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used, as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained : as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect."

He gave the example of a case in 1999, in which DNA information from the perpetrator of a crime was matched with that of “I” in a search of the national database. The sample from “ I ” should have been destroyed, but had not been. “ I ” had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced. If the sample had not been wrongly detained, the offender might have escaped detection."

The offences involved included 53 murders, 33 attempted murders, 94 rapes, 38 sexual offences, 63 aggravated burglaries and 56 cases involving the supply of controlled drugs. On the basis of the existing records, the Home Office statistics estimated that there was a 40% chance that a crime- scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual ’ s profile on the national database. This showed that the fingerprints and samples which could now be retained had in the previous three years played a major role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime."

As to the Convention analysis, Lord Steyn inclined to the view that the mere retention of fingerprints and DNA samples did not constitute an interference with the right to respect for private life but stated that, if he were wrong in that view, he regarded any interference as very modest indeed. Questions of whether, in the future, retained samples could be misused were not relevant in respect of contemporary use of retained samples in connection with the detection and prosecution of crime. If future scientific developments required it, judicial decisions could be made, when the need occurred, to ensure compatibility with the Convention. The provision limiting the permissible use of retained material to “ purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime ...” did not broaden the permitted use unduly, because it was limited by its context."

Counsel for the Home Secretary had contended that the aim of the retention had nothing to do with the past, that is, with the offence of which a person had been acquitted, but was to assist in the investigation of offences in the future. The applicants would only be affected by the retention of the DNA samples if their profiles matched those found at the scene of a future crime. Lord Steyn saw five factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim: (i) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime; (ii) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene; (iii) the fingerprints would not be made public; (iv) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye; (v) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime."

                "“ If justification for retention is in any degree to be by reference to the view of the police on the degree of innocence, then persons who have been acquitted and have their samples retained can justifiably say this stigmatises or discriminates against me – I am part of a pool of acquitted persons presumed to be innocent, but I am treated as though I was not. It is not in fact in any way stigmatising someone who has been acquitted to say simply that samples lawfully obtained are retained as the norm, and it is in the public interest in its fight against crime for the police to have as large a database as possible. ”"

The House of Lords further rejected the applicants ’ complaint that the retention of their fingerprints and samples subjected them to discriminatory treatment in breach of Article 14 of the Convention when compared to the general body of persons who had not had their fingerprints and samples taken by the police in the course of a criminal investigation. Lord Steyn held that, even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention so as to trigger the application of Article 14, the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on “status” for the purposes of Article 14: the difference simply reflected the historical fact, unrelated to any personal characteristic, that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken. The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation. Even if, contrary to his view, it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment, Lord Steyn held that such objective justification had been established: firstly, the element of legitimate aim was plainly present, as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent; secondly, the requirement of proportionality was satisfied, section 64(1A) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime."

She further considered that the difference between fingerprint and DNA data became more important when it came to justify their retention as the justifications for each of these might be very different.

Ethnicity tests on the database might thus provide inferences for use during a police investigation in order, for example, to help reduce a “ suspect pool ” and to inform police priorities. The report noted that social factors and policing practices lead to a disproportionate number of people from black and ethnic minority groups being stopped, searched and arrested by the police, and hence having their DNA profiles recorded; it therefore voiced concerns that inferring ethnic identity from biological samples might reinforce racist views of propensity to criminality.",

Beyond a person ’ s name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family (see, mutatis mutandis, Burghartz v.

Information about the person ’ s health is an important element of private life (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I ).

Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v.

They also accepted the highly sensitive nature of such searching and the need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals (see paragraph 39 above) is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect (see Amann, cited above, § 69 ). This conclusion is similarly not affected by the fact that, since the information is in coded form, it is intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons."

The possibility the DNA profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to private life. This conclusion is consistent with the principle laid down in the Data Protection Convention and reflected in the Data Protection Act that both list personal data revealing ethnic origin among the special categories of sensitive data attracting a heightened level of protection (see paragraphs 3 0-31 and 41 above)."

While true, this consideration cannot alter the fact that fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the individual concerned, allowing his or her identification with precision in a wide range of circumstances.

The Government were given a very wide remit to use samples and DNA profiles notably for “purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime”, “ the investigation of an offence” or “ the conduct of a prosecution”. These purposes were vague and open to abuse as they might, in particular, lead to the collation of detailed personal information outside the immediate context of the investigation of a particular offence. The applicants further submitted that there were insufficient procedural safeguards against misuse or abuse of the information. Records on the Police National Computer ( PNC ) were not only accessible to the police, but also to fifty-six non-police bodies, including government agencies and departments, private groups such as British Telecom and the Association of British Insurers, and even certain employers. Furthermore, the PNC was linked to the Europe-wide “Schengen Information System”. Consequently, their case involved a very substantial and controversial interference with the right to private life, as notably illustrated by ongoing public debate and disagreement about the subject in the United Kingdom. Contrary to the assertion of the Government, the applicants concluded that the issue of the retention of this material was of great individual concern and the State had a narrow margin of appreciation in this field."

In particular, there was no justification at all for the retention of cellular samples following the original generation of the DNA profile; nor had the efficacy of the profiles ’ retention been convincingly demonstrated since the high number of DNA matches relied upon by the Government was not shown to have led to successful prosecutions. Likewise, in most of the specific examples provided by the Government, the successful prosecution had not been contingent on the retention of the records and in certain others the successful outcome could have been achieved through more limited retention in time and scope."

They emphasised, finally, that retention of the records cast suspicion on persons who had been acquitted or discharged of crimes, thus implying that they were not wholly innocent.

In another case, two suspects arrested for rape were eliminated from the investigation as their DNA profiles did not match the crime - scene stain. In two other cases the retention of DNA profiles of the persons found guilty of certain minor offences (disorder and theft) led to establishing their involvement in other crimes committed later. In one case the retention of a suspect ’ s DNA profile following an alleged immigration offence helped his extradition to the United Kingdom a year later when he was identified by one of his victims as having committed rape and murder. Finally, in four cases DNA profiles retained from four persons suspected but not convicted of certain offences (possession of offensive weapons, violent disorder and assault) matched the crime- scene stains collected from victims of rape up to two years later."

Their retention was neither warranted by any degree of suspicion of the applicants ’ involvement in a crime or propensity to crime nor directed at retaining records in respect of investigated alleged offences in the past. The records were retained because the police had already been lawfully in possession of them, and their retention would assist in the future prevention and detection of crime in general by increasing the size of the database. Retention resulted in no stigma and produced no practical consequence for the applicants unless the records matched a crime- scene profile.

The material may be retained irrespective of the nature or gravity of the offence with which the individual was originally suspected or of the age of the suspected offender; fingerprints and samples may be taken – and retained – from a person of any age, arrested in connection with a recordable offence, which includes minor or non-imprisonable offences. The retention is not time-limited; the material is retained indefinitely whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence of which the person was suspected. Moreover, there exist only limited possibilities for an acquitted individual to have the data removed from the national database or the materials destroyed (see paragraph 35 above); in particular, there is no provision for independent review of the justification for the retention according to defined criteria, including such factors as the seriousness of the offence, previous arrests, the strength of the suspicion against the person and any other special circumstances."

The Court acknowledges that the level of interference with the applicants ’ right to private life may be different for each of the three different categories of personal data retained. The retention of cellular samples is particularly intrusive given the wealth of genetic and health information contained therein. However, such an indiscriminate and open-ended retention regime as the one in issue calls for careful scrutiny regardless of these differences."

                "121. The Government contend that the retention could not be considered as having any direct or significant effect on the applicants unless matches in the database were to implicate them in the commission of offences on a future occasion. The Court is unable to accept this argument and reiterates that the mere retention and storing of personal data by public authorities, however obtained, are to be regarded as having a direct impact on the private-life interest of an individual concerned, irrespective of whether subsequent use is made of the data (see paragraph 6 7 above)."

                "122. Of particular concern in the present context is the risk of stigmatisation, stemming from the fact that persons in the position of the applicants, who have not been convicted of any offence and are entitled to the presumption of innocence, are treated in the same way as convicted persons. In this respect, the Court must bear in mind that the right of every person under the Convention to be presumed innocent includes the general rule that no suspicion regarding an accused ’ s innocence may be voiced after his acquittal (see Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, § 31, 21 March 2000, with further references ). It is true that the retention of the applicants ’ private data cannot be equated with the voicing of suspicions. Nonetheless, their perception that they are not being treated as innocent is heightened by the fact that their data are retained indefinitely in the same way as the data of convicted persons, while the data of those who have never been suspected of an offence are required to be destroyed."

                "123. The Government argue that the power of retention applies to all fingerprints and samples taken from a person in connection with the investigation of an offence and does not depend on innocence or guilt. It is further submitted that the fingerprints and samples have been lawfully taken and that their retention is not related to the fact that they were originally suspected of committing a crime, the sole reason for their retention being to increase the size and, therefore, the use of the database in the identification of offenders in the future. The Court, however, finds this argument difficult to reconcile with the obligation imposed by section 64(3) of PACE to destroy the fingerprints and samples of volunteers at their request, despite the similar value of the material in increasing the size and utility of the database. Weighty reasons would have to be put forward by the Government before the Court could regard as justified such a difference in treatment of the applicants ’ private data compared to that of other unconvicted people."

The Court further considers that the retention of the unconvicted persons ’ data may be especially harmful in the case of minors such as the first applicant, given their special situation and the importance of their development and integration in society. The Court has already emphasised, drawing on the provisions of Article 40 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, the special position of minors in the criminal- justice sphere and has noted, in particular, the need for the protection of their privacy at criminal trials (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, §§ 75 and 85, 16 December 1999 ). In the same way, the Court considers that particular attention should be paid to the protection of juveniles from any detriment that may result from the retention by the authorities of their private data following acquittals of a criminal offence. The Court shares the view of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics as to the impact on young persons of the indefinite retention of their DNA material and notes the Council ’ s concerns that the policies applied have led to the over-representation in the database of young persons and ethnic minorities who have not been convicted of any crime (see paragraphs 38-40 above)."

In conclusion, the Court finds that the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers of retention of the fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles of persons suspected but not convicted of offences, as applied in the case of the present applicants, fails to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests and that the respondent State has overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard. Accordingly, the retention at issue constitutes a disproportionate interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for private life and cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society. This conclusion obviates the need for the Court to consider the applicants ’ criticism regarding the adequacy of certain particular safeguards, such as too broad an access to the personal data concerned and insufficient protection against the misuse or abuse of such data."

This treatment related to their status and fell within the ambit of Article 14 of the Convention, which had always been liberally interpreted. For the reasons set out in their submissions under Article 8, there was no reasonable or objective justification for the treatment, nor any legitimate aim or reasonable relationship of proportionality to the purported aim of crime prevention, in particular as regards the samples which played no role in crime detection or prevention.

He referred in particular to the Supreme Court’s statement in its decision of 27 October 1993 that “it was not certain whether at the material time this regulation was still in force”. He emphasised that this Ordinance had never been properly published and therefore could not be considered “law” as it was not accessible. He further submitted that, pursuant to the principle lex posterior derogat legi priori, this Ordinance had de facto been abrogated by the entry into force of the 1989 Rules which governed the same subject. It was also stressed that it was for the State to ensure that its agents, including prison guards, were aware of and apply legal provisions, which were indeed in force.

Contrary to the Government’s submissions, under Section 11 of the Rules of Detention, body search could be ordered “if a need arose”, but clearly not automatically if an inmate left the cell during the night, or during the elections organised in prison. This Section had provided for search of inmate’s clothes, underwear, shoes and his cell, but not for the search of his body. Normally in prisons metal detectors were in use, and if the prison guards had justified grounds on which to order the applicant’s body search, they could have ordered that such detector be used. Moreover, after the applicant refused to strip naked, he had been allowed to return to his cell. In the applicant’s argument, a question arose why the guards had allowed him to return if they had, as the Government contended, serious grounds for a suspicion that he was carrying dangerous devices on him. This discrepancy also indicated that the order to strip naked had been meant as an abuse and had not been dictated by any justified fears."

The same holds true insofar as degrading treatment is concerned (Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1993, Series A no. 247-C, p. 59, § 30). As for the criteria concerning the notion of \"degrading treatment\", the Court notes that the treatment itself will not be degrading, unless the person concerned has undergone humiliation or debasement attaining a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it has to be assessed with regard to the circumstances of any given case (cf., among many authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment; the Dougoz v.

The submissions of the Government in this respect do not allow for establishing that these submissions are untrue. This is so as no internal administrative enquiry of an adversarial character was held into the circumstances of the case. The only factual findings were made in the framework of the applicant’s complaint to the Supreme Court. The Court requested the local Regional Court to conduct investigations in this respect. The Regional Court subsequently requested the prison authorities to submit written declarations of the persons involved in the case and the Supreme Court made its findings on the basis of a note prepared on the basis of testimony given by the prison guards. The applicant was not questioned in the course of that enquiry, nor had it been shown that he had any opportunity to be acquainted with this testimony, or to comment on the statement of the guards.

This, in the Court’s view, showed a lack of respect for the applicant’s human dignity. Given that such treatment was afforded to a person who, as stated above, wished to exercise his right to vote within the framework of arrangements specially provided for in Wrocław prison for persons detained on remand, and in view of the absence of persuasive justification therefor, the Court is of the view that in the present case such behaviour which humiliated and debased the applicant, amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3."

The main difficulty, however, consisted in determining the form of the bail, i.e. whether it should be deposited in cash, in State bonds or by way of mortgage on the applicant’s real property. Regard must be had to the fact that the authorities at a certain point refused that the bail be deposited in the form of mortgage, without questioning the applicant’s title to the property concerned. This, in the Court’s view, implies that the authorities were reticent to accept the bail, which, in case of the applicant’s non-appearance for the trial, would require undertaking certain formalities in order to seize the assets.

According to Article 6 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, this limitation remains valid for the jurisdiction of the Court under that Protocol. It follows that the period which must be examined under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention began to run not on 12 September 1991, the date on which the applicant was charged with criminal offence, but on 1 May 1993, when Poland’s declaration recognising the right of individual petition for the purposes of former Article 25 became effective.

According to some reports, 739 arrested people were not admitted to SIZO during 2004. TB-infected people were thus held in detention in the ITT, which are not fit for holding such persons, beyond the legally established maximum term of arrest (3 or 10 days). This not only violates the rights of the arrested but also promotes the spread of diseases in the ITT. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 1,000 people are held daily in ITT after the maximum time-limit established by law, including 100 people ill with TB. The situation has not improved even after an Instruction (No. 419-p of 5 July 2004) was issued by the Cabinet of Ministers whereby the State Department for the Execution of Sentences was ordered to ensure admission of those arrested who are ill with TB. According to the comments of the Ukrainian authorities, there are plans to solve this problem by delegating the treatment of persons in detention on remand to special establishments of the Ministry of Health which will be guarded by Ministry of Internal Affairs units.

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, §§ 51-52, and the Akdıvar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1996-IV, §§ 65-67). A mere doubt as to the prospect of success is not sufficient to exempt an applicant from submitting a complaint to the competent court (see, for example, Elsanova v. Russia (dec.), no. 57952/00, 15 November 2005)."

These allegations were considered by the investigators and prosecutors, who did not find a prima facie case of ill ‑ treatment. Pursuant to Article 236 ‑ 1 of the CCP, these decisions were amenable to appeal to a court of general jurisdiction (see paragraph 4 7 above). In such cases contentious proceedings are instituted, to which the applicant and the prosecutor are parties. Although in these proceedings the court of general jurisdiction is not competent to pursue an independent investigation or make any findings of fact, a judicial review of a complaint has the benefit of providing a forum guaranteeing due process of law. In public and adversarial proceedings an independent tribunal is called upon to assess whether the applicant has a prima facie case of ill-treatment and, if he has, to reverse the prosecution's decision and order a criminal investigation."

As regards the complaint about his alleged ill ‑ treatment, raised by the applicant before the court dealing with the criminal case against him, the Court notes that the purpose of the criminal proceedings against the applicant was to find him innocent or guilty of the criminal charges levelled against him rather than to attribute responsibility for alleged beatings or afford redress for an alleged breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Belevitskiy, cited above, § 63 ). The trial court therefore could not make any separate findings as to whether or not the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody and, accordingly, applied to the prosecution authorities competent under the domestic law to investigate these allegations. As noted above the applicant did not avail himself of the court procedure, specifically designed for challenging the outcome of the subsequent investigation. Therefore, the applicant's apparently rather vague complaint to the trial court about his alleged ill-treatment did not dispense him from the obligation to exhaust the remedy provided by Article 236-1 of the CCP."

The complaint about the length of the applicant's pre-trial detention was only mentioned in an application form dated 24 June 2006. While it is true that an earlier application form had been submitted by the applicant on 26 April 2006, this did not include any complaints under Article 5 of the Convention. The Court is not persuaded that the reference to the date of the applicant's arrest, made in the context of his complaint about poor medical conditions of detention, may be regarded as an intention to lodge a further complaint under Article 5 § 3.

The first applicant swerved his car to the right to prevent a collision and then applied the brakes. The white Renault also stopped right in front of his car and four men in civilian clothes leapt out. The first applicant then noticed that the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him had also stopped, probably to check what was happening behind. In a matter of seconds, one of the men who had leapt out of the white Renault opened his driver ’ s door, shouted some words in Turkish and put a gun to his forehead, while another tried to pull him out of the car. When the first applicant resisted, holding tight to his unfastened seat belt, the man holding the gun hit him on the head above the left ear with the handle of his gun, which caused him to fall down on the road into a puddle of rainwater measuring 20 to 25 cm, in a semi-conscious state as a result of the force of the blow. The men kicked and punched him on the ground, and twisted and bit his hands to force him to let go of the seat belt, while the first applicant called for help. After receiving some forceful kicks below the pelvis and to the ribs, which were so strong that he thought his ribs were broken, he let go of the belt and rolled on the ground. The four men then picked him up by the arms and legs and dragged him to the white Renault, which was a left-hand drive car. The first applicant estimated that the whole ordeal, which had started at approximately 5.45 a.m., had lasted less than three minutes, and it had been witnessed by the driver of the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him."

After driving in the occupied area for a while, the man sitting to the first applicant ’ s left placed a rope around his neck and tied his hands behind his back with the ends of the same rope, which prevented him from moving. When the applicant asked whether they were going to kill him, the same man answered yes and then the man sitting in the front passenger seat punched him in the face, which damaged his teeth and caused his mouth to bleed."

He was quickly transferred to the other car, with his hands still tied behind his back with the rope that ran around his neck. After driving for another five to seven minutes the second car stopped and he was taken out of the car.

No one explained to him where he was or why he was being held. The person who spoke to him alternated between broken Greek and English.

The first applicant explained to the doctor that he was diabetic and asked the doctor to check his blood sugar levels. Tests showed that his blood sugar level had increased considerably, so the doctor prescribed him an anti ‑ diabetic drug. The first applicant also tried to tell the doctor that he was suffering from pain in his pelvis and ribs, and in particular that the pain in the ribs was making it difficult to breathe, but the doctor paid no attention to his grievances and merely registered the swelling in his head and some redness on his chest and back, without examining the injuries in his mouth or lower body."

As a defense lawyer, as well as not personally having seen the witnesses, I got to know about their identities just before the issuing of the summons, the day before in the afternoon, and issuing a summons the same day, I sent it by hand to the British Sovereign Bases Police. It is not again in my knowledge whether these witnesses were personally served with these summonses. We produced no evidence that they had been duly served.

The courts which tried the first applicant were not courts of Turkey; they did not apply Turkish law, but rather the substantive criminal law and criminal procedure law of Cyprus, which had been codified during the British colonial period and was applicable on both sides of the island. Moreover Turkey, as the respondent State, could not attempt to effect any change in the law of the “ TRNC ” for the simple reason that it could not legislate outside its own borders. In other words, the respondent Government claimed that the acts complained of were imputable exclusively to the “TRNC”, an independent and sovereign State established by the Turkish-Cypriot community."

Similarly, in the subsequent case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, § 77, ECHR 2001 ‑ IV), the Court had found that the reasoning in the Loizidou case was “framed in terms of a broad statement of principle as regards Turkey ’ s general responsibility under the Convention for the policies and actions of the ‘ TRNC ’ authorities”. Nonetheless, the Government claimed that the Court had not clarified the issue as to whether such general responsibility existed in respect of judicial decisions delivered by the courts of the “ TRNC ”, over which the Turkish authorities had no control whatsoever."

Turkey (cited above, § 77 ) it found that since Turkey exercised effective overall control over northern Cyprus, its responsibility could not be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but had also to be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration, which had survived by virtue of Turkish military and other support. The Court also stressed that where the fact of such domination over the territory was established, it was not necessary to determine whether the Contracting State exercised detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration; the fact that the local administration had survived as a result of the Contracting State ’ s military and other support entailed that State ’ s responsibility for its policies and actions (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, § 56, and Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above). It follows that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey ’ s jurisdiction must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey (see Cyprus v.

                "155. The applicants further argued that there were, in any event, no effective domestic remedies in the instant case. Firstly, the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies did not require an applicant to bring proceedings before a tribunal which had been established in violation of international law, as well as of the national law in force in the relevant territory, which remained the law of the Republic of Cyprus. Secondly, even if recourse to the “TRNC” courts was to be treated as a domestic remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the applicants were still not required to exhaust those remedies since the abduction and the subsequent treatment of the first applicant were part of an “ administrative practice ”. Moreover, even assuming that such remedies existed in theory, they would not have been effective in practice in the applicants ’ case because they were not accessible to them because none of them resided in the “TRNC”, and they offered no reasonable prospects of success."

They submitted that given the existing legal and political context and the circumstances in which the first applicant had been abducted, detained and tried as a hostage as part of a State policy, it would have been unrealistic to expect the applicants “to seek remedies in the legal system of the perpetrator”. The “TRNC” was not a valid and legal State and its courts had not been “established by law” within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, as they had not been set up by Turkey through legal acts of its democratic institutions, but rather as a result of an invasion and continuing military control. Turkey did not exercise control over the “TRNC” by rule of law, but simply by means of military occupation; as a consequence, the remedies available in the “TRNC” could not be considered remedies of the respondent High Contracting Party. They submitted that the illegality of those remedies in international law amounted to a “special circumstance” absolving the applicants from the requirement of exhaustion."

However, that conclusion was not to be seen as in any way casting doubt on the view of the international community regarding the establishment of the “TRNC” or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remained the sole legitimate government of Cyprus. In this connection, the Court had stressed in its Demopoulos and Others decision that “allowing the respondent State to correct wrongs imputable to it does not amount to an indirect legitimisation of a regime unlawful under international law” (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99, 3843/02, 13751/02, 13466/03, 10200/04, 14163/04, 19993/04 and 21819/04, § 96, ECHR 2010)."

In view of the above considerations, the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, including issues such as whether or not a particular remedy could be regarded as effective and therefore had to be used, or whether there were any special circumstances which absolved the applicants from the obligation to exhaust those remedies in the circumstances of the instant case, should be examined separately for each specific complaint.",

The first applicant ’ s lawyers had subjected the main prosecution witnesses to extensive cross-examination, and the prosecution had likewise cross-examined the witnesses called by the first applicant. After hearing those witnesses, the domestic courts had accepted the version of the facts as presented by the prosecution. It had accordingly been established that the first applicant had entered the “ TRNC ” illegally from the SBA, between boundary stones nos. 96 and 97 separating the British bases from the TRNC. He had apparently left his car in SBA territory, but the location of the arrest was within the borders of the TRNC. There were a few witnesses who had allegedly seen the first applicant ’ s car on the relevant morning; however, none of the passers-by had witnessed his arrest.

During both the preliminary inquiry and the subsequent hearing before the Famagusta Assize Court, the first applicant ’ s lawyers had insisted on the alleged link between the two incidents. For that purpose, they had called the UN Liaison Officer in Cyprus at the material time, Mr J. C. , to testify as to what Mr M. İ ., the Director of Consular and Minority Affairs at the TRNC Foreign Ministry, had allegedly told him and they had protested when the said evidence was not allowed to be included in the case file for being hearsay.

They referred in particular to the formal protest made by Mr M.İ. to the UN Liaison Officer, Mr J.

They added that while the respondent Government had claimed that the “TRNC” courts had thoroughly examined the allegations of both sides, what took place before those “courts” was not in any way determinative of the way in which the Strasbourg Court should approach the evidence and did not constrain the Court in its fact-finding exercise."

In this connection, the Court emphasises that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role, and that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own assessment in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the reasoned findings of fact reached by the national judicial authorities, particularly where, as in the present case, the Court has not itself had the benefit of examining the relevant witnesses and forming its own assessment of their credibility (see Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey, no. 19807/92, § 71, 25 April 2006, and Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40 713/09 and 41008/09, § 61, ECHR 2012 )."

Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes that following the preliminary inquiry held between 8 and 15 February 2001, the Famagusta Assize Court commenced criminal proceedings against the first applicant on 23 February 2001. During the three -month trial that ensued, the Assize Court was presented with a substantial body of evidence about the events of 13 December 2000, including oral testimony and documentary and photographic evidence submitted by both parties. Relying on that evidence, on 26 April 2001 the Assize Court ruled for the first applicant ’ s conviction for drug-related crimes. It held that, having carried out a comprehensive examination of the testimonies and documentary evidence presented to it, the “testimonies of the prosecution witnesses had been found to be credible, accurate and reliable”, whereas the “testimonies of the defendant and his witnesses had lacked credibility, accuracy and reliability”. The Assize Court thus accepted the facts as presented by the prosecution and convicted the first applicant on that basis."

                "167. While the Court has no reason to suspect that the trial court ’ s admission or assessment of the evidence before it was arbitrary per se, it notes that the Famagusta Assize Court provided no reasoning in relation to its findings of fact and assessment of evidence (see paragraph 84 above). The Court, therefore, cannot determine whether the judgment of the domestic court, which had not only the means but also the principal duty to clearly establish the facts contested by the parties, was the result of a fair and comprehensive consideration of the contradictory arguments before it, or whether it ruled in favour of the official version of the events presented by the prosecution following a perfunctory assessment that did not give sufficient regard to the first applicant ’ s serious claims. The absence of such reasoning not only has implications vis ‑ à-vis certain procedural rights of the applicant, which will be examined in further detail below, but also detracts from the reliance which might otherwise have been placed on the trial court ’ s judgment by the Court. In these circumstances, the Court is compelled to make its own assessment of the facts on the basis of the evidence before it."

                "168. The Court reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence in this context, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard: as applied by the Court, it has an autonomous meaning (see Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, § 156, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX for further details). According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, amongst others, Mathew, cited above, § 156 )."

He claimed before the Court that the driver of the white Isuzu pickup with registration number UJ 100, who had been driving ahead of him on the morning in question, must have witnessed his abduction.

In his statement before the Famagusta Assize Court, N.M. claimed that on the morning of the incident, he had seen a man getting out of a red pickup parked on the main Pyla-Pergamos road, which was the only car around. Three to four other men were in the fields to the right side of the road. One of them was being dragged by the arms and pleading to be let go (see paragraph 70 above). According to the account presented by the first applicant, however, there were at least two other cars on the road that had been used for his abduction, and after a struggle, he had been transferred directly from his car to the red Renault. Moreover, the first applicant made no mention of being dragged across the field by the side of the road, as alleged by N.M. The Court observes that the first applicant made no attempt to offer an explanation for N.M. ’ s conflicting account."

Only two witnesses, Mr G.H. and Mr A.G., who were apparently driving a few minutes ahead of the first applicant on the morning in question, claimed to have seen the red and the white Renault cars that were allegedly used to orchestrate the first applicant ’ s abduction. However, the descriptions they provided in relation to those cars were somewhat inconsistent: whereas G.H. claimed that there was a white Renault parked on the left -hand side of the road with its bonnet open, and a red Renault to the right of that white car, A.G. stated that the car parked on the left -hand side of the road with an open bonnet had been a red Renault, and that the white Renault had been waiting on the opposite side of the road by some cypress trees and had flashed its lights at him. Even more striking was the fact that in his earlier statement to the SBA police on 19 December 2000 – that is, only six days after the incident – A.G. had not mentioned anything about a white car, which is hard to explain considering his later claim that that car had flashed its headlights at him. Moreover, as already mentioned in paragraph 122 above, the statement of G.H. before the Famagusta Assize Court did not match his earlier statement to the SBA police."

While the Court is ready to accept that some of the discrepancies noted above, in particular those concerning the exact state in which the first applicant ’ s car was found, may be explained by the differences in the subjective assessments of individual witnesses and the passage of time, it considers in any event that the establishment of the location and the circumstances in which the car was found, despite the many valid questions it raises, does not on its own shed light on the circumstances in which the first applicant was detained. Similarly, the fact that the sniffer dog found no traces belonging to the first applicant around his abandoned car or any other traces in the fields, although it must certainly have been taken into account by the trial court in its consideration as to how the first applicant had reached “TRNC” territory, does not as such rebut the Government ’ s allegations regarding his capture, particularly in view of Mr N.M. ’ s conflicting statement that he had seen a number of persons in the fields, whose tracks the dog did not pick up either. The Court stresses in this connection that the evidence presented by the applicants is not even sufficient to establish whether the first applicant himself was driving his car on the relevant morning or whether he was alone in the car."

Although the applicants alleged that a number of important Turkish Cypriot witnesses had been unable to testify in the first applicant ’ s favour on account of the threats to which they had been subjected, the Court cannot make a conclusive finding on that issue either, particularly in view of the statements of Mr M. Aziz, the first applicant ’ s lawyer, to the trial court and to Mr Rauf Denktaş suggesting his unawareness of such intimidation ( see paragraphs 83 and 134 above, respectively), and given that there were no real attempts to substantiate the allegations of witness intimidation before the trial court during the criminal proceedings."

The Court also observes that although the first applicant referred in his application before the Court to a Turkish Cypriot detainee who had allegedly been asked by the “TRNC” police to falsely admit to being his drugs contact in the “TRNC” (see paragraph 29 above), the evidence in the case file indicates that he did not draw that serious allegation to the attention of his lawyers or the domestic courts, nor did he subsequently reiterate it in his statement to the SBA police following his release."

The Court further takes note of the separate investigation conducted by the SBA police into the circumstances of the first applicant ’ s detention, which resulted in a finding that he had been “taken from his vehicle at the locus where that vehicle was abandoned – well within the Eastern Sovereign Base Areas” (see paragraph 129 above). The Court observes in this connection that according to the documents submitted to it, the SBA police interviewed more than a hundred people within the framework of that investigation, and that it found the opportunity to review all of those interviews. As explained in detail in the “Facts” section, amongst the interviewees were the defence witnesses who subsequently appeared before the Famagusta Assize Court, a number of Turkish Cypriots who either worked for the first applicant or knew him otherwise, some other Greek Cypriot builders who had used the Pyla-Pergamos road on the relevant morning, as well as the residents of some of the houses in the vicinity. Even though the assessment of the SBA police may appear plausible having regard to the place where the applicant ’ s car was found and the latter ’ s state as well as the official information about the place of the applicant ’ s arrest, this assessment does not constitute sufficient evidence in support of the applicant ’ s account of events (see also paragraph 187 below)."

The Court observes in the first place that none of the residents of the area where the first applicant allegedly abandoned his car in the SBA or crossed into the “TRNC” had seen anything suspicious on the morning in question. Similarly, none of the other Greek or Turkish Cypriot persons interviewed provided any additional information to that subsequently presented to the Famagusta Assize Court. Some of them had no information to share with the SBA police, other than the rumours they had heard; some others stated that they had not seen anything suspicious, not even the first applicant ’ s car, even though they had also used the Pyla-Pergamos road at around 6.30 to 7 a.m. that morning. Others, however, attested to having seen the first applicant ’ s abandoned car, although again with some inconsistencies as to its location and state – such as which way the car was facing, whether its engine was running, whether and if so which doors of the car had been left open and whether the headlights were on. The Court stresses at this juncture that the car had been moved to another spot following the instructions of the first applicant ’ s brother prior to the arrival of the SBA police officers at the scene of the incident. Therefore, the official SBA records only included second - hand information on where and in what condition the first applicant ’ s car had originally been found, instead of photographs or other such direct evidence."

The first three of those statements, made by N.M., G.H. and A.G. have already been discussed in detail in paragraphs 171 to 172 above. The fourth statement that the Court wishes to highlight is that of Mr V.Z., the Greek Cypriot contractor who owned the aforementioned white Isuzu pickup with registration number UJ 100, whose statement has been summarised in paragraph 124 above. The statement given by V.Z. regarding his employee X ’ s alleged witnessing of the first applicant ’ s abduction does not correspond to the latter ’ s testimony. Whereas the first applicant alleged that the white Isuzu had been travelling ahead of him in the direction of Pergamos, and had actually stopped by the red Renault car and talked briefly to the persons standing in front of that car before driving away towards Pergamos, V.Z. claimed that X was travelling from Pergamos to Pyla, namely in the opposite direction, and had driven past the cars in question as the first applicant was being dragged out of his car, without stopping. The Court also finds it curious that although V.Z. informed the SBA police of X ’ s alleged eyewitness account as early as 16 December 2000, neither V.Z. himself, nor Kyriacos Tsiakkourmas or the SBA police officer who had allegedly tracked X down had been called as witnesses by the defence during the subsequent criminal proceedings against the first applicant before the Famagusta Assize Court."

While the first applicant had claimed during the domestic proceedings and subsequently before the Court that he had been forced to stop after his car had been intercepted by a white Renault on his way to Rabiye ’ s café (see paragraphs 17 and 66 above), according to an SBA report dated 15 December 2000, he claimed that he had been forced out of his vehicle only after he had willingly stopped to offer assistance to a car which appeared to have an engine problem (see paragraph 126 above). Moreover, although the first applicant stated before the domestic courts and the Strasbourg Court that his abductors had personally handed him over to the Turkish Cypriot police and that he had not seen the drugs which he was accused of smuggling until later in the day at the police station (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above), two SBA police reports dated 15 and 16 December 2000 noted that the first applicant had been arrested by the Turkish Cypriot police after his abductors had abandoned him in the vicinity of an airport with a package of drugs (see paragraphs 126 and 127 above)."

While the Court has no reason to doubt the independence and impartiality of Mr J.C., it is not prepared to give decisive weight to that untested circumstantial evidence.

No fingerprint examination was conducted on the package of cannabis resin allegedly seized from the first applicant; it was explained that since the package had been taken directly from his hands by Sub-inspector Ü.Ö. himself, it had been deemed unnecessary to submit it for a fingerprint examination.

The fact that the first applicant was arrested in “TRNC” territory for smuggling drugs only some ten days after the controversial arrest of Mr Ömer Gazi Tekoğul by the Greek Cypriot authorities, which apparently led to some strong protests from the Turkish Cypriot side, may cast some doubts on the accusations brought against him. Moreover, whereas the allegation remains that the first applicant entered the “TRNC” between border stones nos. 96 and 97 separating the SBA from the “TRNC”, the Court notes that the domestic authorities, including the trial court, do not appear to have concerned themselves much with how he may have arrived there.

This means that in the context of a detention under Article 5 § (1) (c), the competent court has to examine not only the compliance with the procedural requirements of domestic law, but also the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Stašaitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, § 90, 21 March 2002). Moreover, in guaranteeing to persons arrested or detained a right to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, Article 5 § 4 also proclaims their right, following the institution of such proceedings, to a speedy judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of the detention and ordering its termination if it proves unlawful ( see Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 118, 4 October 2005)."

Turkey, cited above, § 237, and Protopapa v. Turkey, no. 16084/90, § 87, 24 February 2009 ). Therefore, unless their inexistence or ineffectiveness – in general or in the particular circumstances of the case – could be proven, resort had to be made to those remedies. The Court emphasises in this connection that it cannot be asserted, on the one hand, that there has been a violation of an Article of the Convention because a State has not provided a remedy, while on the other hand, that any such remedy, if provided, would be null and void (see Cyprus v.

The Court will therefore confine the scope of its examination to the availability and effectiveness of the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, as per its ordinary practice (see Čuprakovs v.

                "206. The purpose of a habeas corpus hearing is to subject the question of the lawfulness of a detention to the scrutiny of a court of law. In the first applicant ’ s case, he was first brought before a judge on 13 December 2000, soon after his “arrest”, and that judge ordered his remand in custody. Subsequently, on 21 December 2000 and 15 February 2001, the first applicant appeared before the “TRNC” Nicosia District Court and the Famagusta District Court, respectively, and on both occasions it was decided to prolong his remand in custody, despite his consistent protests that he had been unlawfully abducted. The Court considers that in all those hearings, the question of the lawfulness of the first applicant ’ s detention was incorporated in the decisions whether to order his detention or to prolong it. The respondent Government did not dispute this; in fact, they themselves claimed in their observations that it had been open to the first applicant to challenge the lawfulness of his detention within the criminal proceedings against him, including on those three occasions when he appeared before the Nicosia and Famagusta District Courts."

The Court is, therefore, of the view that while the aforementioned proceedings in which the first applicant ’ s detention was ordered and extended may have been technically distinct from the habeas corpus procedure referred to by the Government, in the absence of any information to the contrary, they were ultimately directed towards the same end, which was the protection of the applicant from arbitrary deprivation of liberty. It was, therefore, not necessary for him to seek a separate writ of habeas corpus. The Court recalls in this connection that where a remedy has been pursued, use of another one which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 40, 19 February 2009, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 58, ECHR 2009)."

The Court notes at the outset that while Article 5 does not contain any explicit mention of a right to legal assistance, certain special circumstances may call for such assistance for the effective exercise of the right provided under Article 5 § 4 (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, §§ 84-86, 25 October 2007). Bearing in mind that the first applicant possessed no legal knowledge, was before a foreign jurisdiction and was allegedly provided with insufficient interpretation, legal representation would appear to have been indispensable to enable him to exercise his right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. The Court notes in this regard that although legal assistance was available to the first applicant some two days after his detention, he claimed, and the Government did not dispute, that at least until his transfer to the Nicosia Central Prison on the evening of 21 December 2000, he had not been allowed to confer with his lawyers in conditions of confidentiality; all their meetings were attended by police officers who stood within earshot. The Court reiterates in this regard that respect for lawyer-client confidentiality is as important in the context of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention as in that of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c); confidential communication with one ’ s lawyer is protected by the Convention as an important safeguard of the right to defence, which also applies in the context of Article 5 § 4 (see Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, §§ 49-50, 13 March 2007, and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 198 and the cases cited therein, and § 232, 31 May 2011). The adverse circumstances in which the first applicant met with his lawyers in the first eight days of his detention, during which period he appeared before the “TRNC” Nicosia District Court twice (on 13 and 21 December 2000), without any apparent justification, inevitably inhibited free discussion and thus hampered his right to effectively challenge the lawfulness of his detention, including by way of seeking a writ of habeas corpus (see Castravet, cited above, § 51), whereas the opportunity for legal review must be provided soon after the person is taken into detention (see, among others, Lebedev, cited above, § 78, and Molotchko v.

Although he protested in vain that he was innocent, he was not given a realistic opportunity to challenge the legality of his detention, whereas the officers who had allegedly arrested him had been able to make submissions to the court freely. He was, therefore, initially denied some of the minimum procedural guarantees required for an effective exercise of the right under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, including those of the right to adversarial proceedings and equality of arms (see Lebedev, cited above, § 76, and Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that while Article 5 § 4 of the Convention does not impose an obligation on a judge examining the lawfulness of detention to address every argument raised by the detained person, its guarantees would be deprived of their substance if the judge could treat as irrelevant, or disregard, particular facts invoked by the detainee which could cast doubt on the existence of the conditions essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty (see Nikolova v.

The Court nevertheless notes that the lawfulness of the first applicant ’ s detention was indeed contested throughout the proceedings, both by the applicant himself and by his numerous witnesses, all of whom provided detailed, albeit not always consistent, testimonies in support of his allegations that he had been abducted from SBA territory by Turkish Cypriot agents. However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant ’ s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Jėčius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX ). Not even when it delivered its judgment against the first applicant did the Famagusta Assize Court explain why it had disregarded his allegations of abduction. It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were “ not credible ”, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case. Moreover, contrary to the Government ’ s allegation, the fact that he did not explicitly invoke Article 5 of the Convention during those proceedings cannot be held against him, as he raised the substance of his Article 5 complaints before the relevant courts (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, §§ 24-32, Series A no. 236, and Karapanagiotou and Others v. Greece, no. 1571/08, § 29, 28 October 2010 )."

He claimed in the first place that the remedy in question could not be considered to be effective in theory, as both the first ‑ instance court that had ordered his conviction and the higher court that would have reviewed it on appeal had been established by the occupying power in violation of both the national law of the Republic of Cyprus and international law."

The Court has already held in numerous cases, as well as in paragraphs 157 and 203 above, that remedies available in the “TRNC” could be regarded as “domestic remedies” of the respondent State for the purposes of Article 35 § 1, regardless of the political circumstances in which they had been set up, and that they had to be exhausted, unless their ineffectiveness could be shown otherwise. The Court acknowledges that there may be circumstances where a court established by a de facto entity may not be regarded as a valid “court” for the purposes of the Convention, if it belongs to a system that does not operate on a “constitutional and legal basis” reflecting a judicial tradition compatible with the Convention ( see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 436, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII). However, the Court has already found that the court system set up in the “TRNC” was to be considered to have been “established by law” with reference to the “constitutional and legal basis” on which it operated, and it has not accepted the allegation that the “TRNC” courts as a whole lacked independence and/or impartiality (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 237, and Protopapa, cited above, § 87)."

Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes that while the criminal proceedings against the first applicant may have suffered from a number of serious shortcomings, and despite the turbulent political background against which they took place, they did not involve any flagrant arbitrariness that removed the legitimacy of the Famagusta Assize Court, or of the whole court system established in the “TRNC”, for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention (see, conversely, Ilaşcu and Others, cited above ). The Court refers in particular to the various procedural guarantees offered to the first applicant during the criminal proceedings, which allowed him to defend himself in a public and adversarial hearing with the help of lawyers of his own choice, to call numerous witnesses and to present evidence on an equal basis with the prosecution. In those circumstances, the Court cannot accept the first applicant ’ s argument that he was exempted from appealing against the Famagusta Assize Court ’ s judgment in view of the inherent unlawfulness of the courts set up under “TRNC” authority."

The Court reiterates in this regard that borders, factual or legal, are not an obstacle per se to the exhaustion of domestic remedies; as a general rule, applicants living outside the jurisdiction of a Contracting State are not exempted from exhausting domestic remedies within that State, practical inconveniences or understandable personal reluctance notwithstanding. As the Court held in the case of Demopoulos and Others (cited above, § 98 ), the fact that the first applicant lived outside the occupied area provided no excuse for not applying to a “TRNC” court, particularly bearing in mind that he was legally represented, including by a local lawyer practising in the “TRNC”."

Allegations of ill-treatment had, however, been brought to the judicial authorities ’ attention on 21 December 2000, when the first applicant had appeared before the “TRNC” Nicosia District Court for a remand hearing with the assistance of his lawyers. The respondent Government contended that the District Court had found the allegations of ill-treatment to be groundless, whereas in reality, no such examination had taken place before that court; the District Court ’ s judgment had instead been limited to the first applicant ’ s bail request. As for the argument that the first applicant should have appealed against the judgment of the Famagusta Assize Court, the Government of Cyprus stated, inter alia, that the question of ill-treatment had been only a “peripheral” issue in the criminal proceedings before that court, the main aim of which had been to determine the charges against the first applicant, and the trial court had not addressed the allegations of ill ‑ treatment.

However, the Court notes from the minutes submitted to it that the said court did not rule in any way on the applicant ’ s allegations of ill-treatment, but rather confined its examination to the bail request lodged by the applicant. The District Court ’ s reasoning that his statements lacked credibility and reliability referred only to the assurances given by the first applicant regarding his bail request, not to his allegations of ill ‑ treatment. In those circumstances, and given that applicants are expected to pursue only those remedies which relate to the breaches alleged and which offer a reasonable prospect of success, the Court does not consider that the first applicant failed to exhaust the domestic remedies in relation to his Article 3 complaints by not appealing against a decision purely concerning his bail request and the prolongation of his remand in custody."

The trial court rendered no decision on the allegations of ill-treatment raised by the first applicant, nor did it examine whether the force used against him during his alleged arrest had been proportionate.

The Government further claimed that the allegations of ill ‑ treatment made by the first applicant were not supported by appropriate evidence; the medical examinations conducted in the aftermath of his arrest, including by a UN doctor, had shown some superficial grazes behind the ears and the chest, and some tenderness on his back and behind his neck. While it was possible that those injuries had been sustained as a result of his resistance to the police, they were certainly not consistent with allegations of severe beating. Yet more significant, in the Government ’ s view, was the fact that when the Turkish Cypriot doctor E.A., who had examined the first applicant on 13 December 2000, had asked him through a civilian interpreter if he had any complaints, the applicant had not mentioned having been assaulted."

The Court further notes that while the parties differ as to the exact circumstances in which the first applicant sustained the relevant injuries – the Government claiming that they had been inflicted on account of the applicant ’ s resistance to his arrest and the latter arguing that he had been purposefully beaten at the time of his abduction by agents of the “TRNC” – it is not disputed that he was injured while under the control of “TRNC” agents and as a result of the use of force by the latter during his arrest. Taking into account the injuries noted in the medical reports of 13 and 14 December 2000 and the context in which they were sustained, the Court accordingly finds that this complaint is sufficiently serious to raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention."

Having regard to the conflicting submissions before it, it falls to the Court to determine whether the force used for the first applicant ’ s arrest was excessive and thus violated Article 3 of the Convention.

In particular, while the first applicant claimed that he had been hit forcefully above the left ear with the butt of a gun, to the extent that he tumbled out of the car as a result of the force applied and lost consciousness for a while (see paragraph 17 above), the Court notes that the medical examination conducted approximately eight hours after that incident noted only a small swelling above his left ear, without any bleeding or bruising. It appears that the swelling had almost subsided by the time of his second examination by a UN doctor the next day, despite the lack of any particular treatment, which raises doubts as to the veracity of his allegations. The Court moreover notes that whereas the first applicant claimed to have received a strong punch in the face, which allegedly caused his mouth to bleed and damaged his teeth, neither of the medical reports recorded such injuries to the mouth. Similarly, although the first applicant argued that he had experienced problems breathing because of the strong blow to his ribs, the medical experts did not record any substantial injuries in the rib area to corroborate that allegation."

He claimed in particular, in connection with his initial detention at the Saray police station, that the cell in which he had been placed had been very small, measuring only about 1.80 by 1.20 metres; that the window in the cell had not been covered with glass, so rain and cold air had come in from the outside; that he had been given only one very dirty blanket, despite being constantly cold; and that there had been mould on the walls. He added that there had been no onsite shower facilities and the toilets in the police station had been very unhygienic; no soap or toilet paper had been provided and the flush had not functioned. Moreover, on a number of occasions the police had not allowed him out of his cell to go to the toilet, whereas he had had to urinate often on account of his diabetes. He had therefore used a plastic bottle to urinate in his cell. He also complained that on the first two days of his detention at the Saray police station, he had hardly been given any food, and afterwards he had ordered food from the canteen with the money sent to him by his family."

Malta, no. 55352/12, § 89, 23 July 2013), they are nevertheless expected to corroborate their allegations as much as the circumstances allow them. In similar situations the Court has considered, for example, written statements by fellow inmates provided by applicants in support of their allegations (see Visloguzov, cited above, § 45 ) or documents showing that relevant issues had been brought to the attention of the domestic authorities as sufficient evidence to declare the complaint well ‑ founded and shift the burden of proof to the Government (see Daniliuc v.

The Court notes that while the first applicant might have encountered understandable problems in submitting statements from other detainees, on account of the obvious language barrier and the fact that he did not share his cell with anyone else, it was nevertheless open to him to submit a copy of a complaint, made by himself or his lawyers, to any domestic authority describing in detail the physical conditions of his detention. The first applicant, however, has not submitted any evidence to show that he raised his complaints with the authorities, or even with his lawyers or the UN officials who visited him a number of times during his detention at the Saray police station, which inevitably raises doubts regarding the credibility of his allegations (see Bragin v. Russia (dec.), no. 8258/06, 28 January 2010). The Court particularly notes in this connection the report of the UN inspector dated 14 December 2000, in which the first applicant was quoted as saying that he had no complaints in relation to how he had been treated since his alleged handover to the Turkish Cypriot police, and had not mentioned his allegedly poor detention conditions (see paragraph 30 above)."

                "286. The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, for example by providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX, and Kudła, cited above, §§ 93-94). Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 87, ECHR 2000-VII). In determining whether the authorities have discharged their health-care obligations vis-à-vis a detainee in their charge, the Court ’ s task is to assess the quality of the medical services provided to the detainee in the light of his state of health and “the practical demands of imprisonment” and to determine whether, in the circumstances of a particular case, the health-care standard applied was compatible with the human dignity of the detainee (see, for instance, Kaverzin v. Ukraine, no. 23893/03, § 138, 15 May 2012, with further references)."

The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kudła, cited above, §91). Moreover, the failure to provide proper medical aid to a detainee would not fall under Article 3 unless there was actual detriment to his or her physical or mental condition, or avoidable suffering of a certain intensity, or an immediate risk of such detriment or suffering (see, for instance, Mikalauskas v. Malta, no. 4458/10, § 63, 23 July 2013)."

The Court notes that the first applicant in the instant case had been suffering from type-2 diabetes for approximately four years prior to his detention, and that he generally kept it under control through diet. Soon after being detained, he informed the police officers of his medical condition. They accordingly took him to a hospital, where his blood sugar level was measured and he was prescribed anti-diabetic medication. The UNFICYP medical officer who examined the first applicant the day after his detention noted that he was being given medication for his diabetes. He further noted that arrangements had been made to provide him with a blood sugar monitoring kit."

It appears from the documents submitted by the parties that from the time of his detention until his release, the first applicant was under the medical supervision of a number of doctors, including three different UNFICYP medical officers and two different specialists in internal medicine and endocrinology, who examined him regularly to monitor his diabetes and overall health, and prescribed a course of treatment specific to his needs. The Court acknowledges that the mere fact that a detainee was seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 116, 29 November 2007). Nevertheless, relying on the information in the case file, the Court considers that in the instant case, the first applicant ’ s condition was being monitored overall by doctors who frequently examined him and that the prison authorities generally responded adequately to his medical treatment requirements. There is no evidence of any complaint raised by the first applicant during the course of his detention to suggest that the prison authorities had ignored his medical needs. Moreover, the doctors who examined the first applicant stated expressly on various occasions that he had been receiving satisfactory treatment and had been following a dietary regime in line with the requirements of his medical condition."

The Court also notes that the authorities did not withhold medical assistance from the first applicant on account of his uncooperative attitude. Not only did the frequent visits of the doctors continue, but at some point he was admitted to a hospital, where he stayed for approximately a week for close monitoring of his condition and the administration of the appropriate course of treatment, which he had failed to duly follow when left to his own devices."

On 14 May 2010 the applicant, former Vice- Mayor of Budapest and former Member of Parliament, was arrested on charges of aggravated fraudulent breach of trust committed by misusing funds at the Budapest Transport Company. The police apprehended him shortly after he had lost his right to parliamentary immunity, when the new MPs elected in the 2010 general elections had been sworn in. Previously, in January and March 2010, criminal proceedings had been initiated against some of the Transport Company ’ s senior officials and a close colleague of the applicant, in the same context."

It outlined that the alleged corruption cases at the Budapest Transport Company had attracted intense publicity and that the applicant ’ s indictment was more than foreshadowed given the admissions made by the other suspects in the ongoing investigation. The applicant had denied several times the press rumours about his leaving the country, and on 11 May 2010 he had also indicated to the authorities his willingness to cooperate."

Reiterating in essence the reasons in the prosecution ’ s motion, the court held that there was a danger that the applicant would abscond in the face of the serious charges, which was even more plausible given that he had sold a number of properties in his name. The court noted that an ‘ element ’ had occurred in the investigation pointing to the risk that the applicant might abscond by leaving the country; however, this circumstance was not specified. The court also held that because the applicant ’ s immunity had been removed only a short time before, several further steps of investigation were still outstanding and that therefore the risk of collusion or interference was real.",

The defence ’ s fresh arguments to demonstrate the unlikelihood of the applicant ’ s intention to abscond, in particular the fact that the applicant had paid off a debt of 16 million Hungarian forints some months before his accusation, did not impress the courts, either.

The prison authorities relied on section 118 (2) of Law-Decree No. 11 of 1979.

Indeed, his condition had only improved in the prison hospital, in a different environment, and once he had been returned to the penitentiary institution his ailment had started to deteriorate rapidly. His extreme loss of weight had not been as intended and had certainly not been the result of the use of the stimulation belt. His counsel had repeatedly warned the prison authorities about the potential danger of such a drastic weight loss, but his detention conditions, including his nutrition, had not improved.

Upon the doctor ’ s recommendation he had been permanently placed in a larger cell, and a prolongation of his open-air stays had been permitted when the medical expert had stated that it would improve his condition. The rejection of his earlier request for prolonged open-air time had been justified by some improvement in his health at that time.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v.

To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v.

In this connection the Court would point out that Article 5 § 3 cannot be read as obliging the national authorities to release a detainee on account of his state of health. The question of whether or not the condition of the person in custody is compatible with his continued detention should primarily be determined by the national courts and they are in general not obliged to release the detainee on health grounds or to place him in a civil hospital to enable him to receive a particular kind of medical treatment (see Kudła v.

That provision does not give the judicial authorities a choice between either bringing the accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release – even subject to guarantees. Until conviction he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of Article 5 § 3 is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see, among other authorities, Neumeister v.

The Court does not underestimate the actions of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences in limiting the scope and duration of the monitoring arrangements from August 1999 onwards. However, it is of the view that the monitoring of the applicant ’ s correspondence was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention as it was not “in accordance with the law”, given that section 18 of the Prison Administration Act does not regulate either the duration of measures monitoring prisoners ’ correspondence or the reasons capable of justifying such measures, and does not indicate with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the discretion conferred on the authorities in the relevant sphere (see, inter alia, Labita, cited above, §§ 175-85). It sees no reason to depart in the instant case from its existing case-law, designed to ensure that all prisoners enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (see Calogero Diana, cited above, § 33, and Campisi v. Italy, no. 24358/02, § 50, 11 July 2006 )."

As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners ’ correspondence. Accordingly, from the end of 1993 the sole basis for monitoring of correspondence was section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975, as amended by section 1 of Law no. 1 of 1977.",

With particular reference to persons deprived of their liberty, Article 3 imposes a positive obligation on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v.

Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, İlhan v.

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat ( see Mouisel, cited above, § 40 ), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well ‑ being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, § 76, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 38, 15 January 2004 )."

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, § 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a) the prisoner ’ s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v.

On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Argenti v.

The Court arrived at this conclusion by taking account of two factors in particular, namely the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime and the fact that the Minister of Justice could issue a new decree without being bound by any decision the court responsible for the execution of sentences might have taken to rescind all or part of the restrictions imposed by the previous decree.

In that context the Court considers that, given the specific nature of the phenomenon of organised crime, particularly of the mafia type, and the fact that family visits have frequently served as a means of conveying orders and instructions to the outside, the – admittedly substantial – restrictions on visits, and the accompanying controls, could not be said to be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see Salvatore v.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasises that where measures interfering with prisoners ’ correspondence are taken, it is essential that reasons be given for the interference, such that the applicant and/or his advisers can satisfy themselves that the law has been correctly applied to him and that decisions taken in his case are not unreasonable or arbitrary. The Court further emphasises the Ombudsman ’ s role as a guardian of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the importance of respect for the confidentiality of correspondence of prisoners with the Ombudsman since it could – and in this case did – concern allegations against the prison authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 62, Series A no. 233 ).

This time was used for personal hygiene purposes and taking meals. It was the applicant ’ s responsibility to clean his cell and he was provided with all the necessary equipment.

The cell had no external window and the window of the cell door was considerably smaller than the Government had indicated. The applicant was excessively restricted in his ability to use the toilet or have a shower : for the first four days of his solitary confinement he was forced to use an empty water bottle to urinate and nylon bags for other needs. These were provided to him by a prison officer through the small window in the cell door. Due to the cold, his arm and shoulder had frozen and he suffered from pain but the doctor was not allowed by the prison authorities to provide him with painkillers. He was nevertheless given an anti-inflammatory gel by the doctor using her own funds.

He had no contact with his family in the prison during the period of his solitary confinement and no contact was possible during his court visits.

A criminal investigation had apparently only been initiated after the prisoner concerned succeeded in bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister of Justice and Public Order, who transmitted the case to the competent authority.",

It would appear that, on 18 July 2003, one of the alleged perpetrators (I.C.) of the above-mentioned assault had severely beaten another inmate; the latter had required hospital treatment as a result. The Commissioner for Administration found that the case had not been investigated thoroughly by the establishment ’ s management and added that ‘ the inexcusable delay in investigating such a serious incident gives good reason to suspect preferential treatment vis-à-vis I.C. ’.",

It would be entirely unacceptable for prison staff to threaten prisoners in the above-mentioned manner as a means of control, let alone place prisoners at risk of assault from fellow inmates. The CPT wishes to emphasise that the duty of care which is owed by the prison authorities to prisoners in their charge includes the responsibility to protect them from other prisoners who might wish to cause them harm. In particular, prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary.",

The diligent examination by prison management of all information which may come to its attention regarding possible ill-treatment of prisoners by staff or inter-prisoner violence (whether or not that information takes the form of a formal complaint) and, if necessary, the instigation of proceedings, is also essential. Indeed, the lack of an appropriate response by prison management can foster a climate in which those minded to ill-treat prisoners can quickly come to believe – and with very good reason – that they can do so with impunity. The delegation gained the impression that the management of Nicosia Central Prisons was reluctant to adopt a proactive approach in this respect ... ”"

The CPT wishes to stress that the principle of proportionality requires that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement-type regime, which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. In particular, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible. Further, they should be surrounded by certain guarantees. A prisoner in isolation or confinement or in respect of whom such a measure is extended, should be informed in writing of the reasons therefor (it being understood that there might be reasonable justification for withholding specific details related to security from the prisoner) and should be given an opportunity to express his views on the matter and have the right to appeal to an authority outside the prison establishment concerned against the imposition or extension of the measure. Further, the application of the measure should be fully re-examined at regular intervals (at least every three months).

Further, although the application of isolation/confinement for a prolonged period can be necessary in exceptional cases for reasons related to good order and safety, the CPT considers that the application of such a measure for disciplinary purposes is unacceptable; the use of isolation/confinement for such purposes should be governed exclusively by Sections 153 to 162 of the Prisons Regulations.",

It was, at the relevant time, composed of twelve members drawn from both the public and private sectors, including representatives of non-governmental organisations and the Cyprus Bar Association. Its chairman was the Director-General of the Ministry of Justice. The Prisons Board had the power to hear and investigate complaints submitted to it by prisoners, including complaints as to their treatment, and to investigate prisoners ’ living conditions. For this purpose, its members were afforded the right of free entry at all times to all areas of the prison, of free communication with prisoners outside the presence of prison officers, of inspection of prison records and of the conduct of any investigation in the prison which they considered necessary.

He contended that his isolation precluded him from obtaining such proof and that, in the circumstances, an Ombudsman ’ s investigation was necessary to collate the necessary proof. However, because of the monitoring of his correspondence, the Ombudsman only received his complaint on 5 November 2003 and her report dated 21 November 2003 was only brought to his attention some days later. He concluded that his failure to take proceedings before the Supreme Court was due to: the prison director, who deliberately made it difficult for him to collect the necessary papers for his application; the 75-day time limit for filing a recourse; his isolation which prevented him from submitting his application; and the refusal of lawyers to represent him."

In the present case, it is not clear that the decision of the prison director to place the applicant in solitary confinement and restrict his visitation rights or the decision to monitor the applicant ’ s correspondence would constitute acts enabling the Supreme Court to exercise its revisional jurisdiction. In this regard, the Court observes that in the context of a separate application lodged with the Court (no. 42432/07 Andreas Onoufriou v.

In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that the relevant decision did not constitute an “administrative act” enabling the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.

The Court observes that the prison diary submitted by the respondent Government records meetings between the applicant and the Prisons Board on 1 and 5 November 2003. It further observes that the Government have not disputed that the applicant sought to make a complaint to the Prisons Board. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant did attempt to lodge his complaints with the Prisons Board but for reasons which are unexplained, the Prisons Board did not take any further action to investigate the complaints and report its findings to the applicant. In any event, in circumstances such as those arising in the present application, there is an obligation to conduct an ex officio investigation as soon as Article 3 is raised in substance (see Selmouni, cited above, §§ 79 to 80).

Ensslin and Others v. Germany, no. 7572/76, Commission decision of 8 July 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 14, p. 91); (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 8158/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1980, DR 21, p. 95); Rohde v.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the individual in question and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § 74, ECHR 2001-III; and Valašinas v.

Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 56, 17 September 2009 ). Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve an element of suffering or humiliation. However, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kudła v.

First, solitary confinement measures should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Second, the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Third, the authorities ’ decisions should make it possible to establish that they have carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by.

No formal record of the decision authorising the solitary confinement or any extension has been provided; indeed, the Government have not made any submissions regarding the manner in which the decision was made. The justification for the confinement provided for by the prison authorities following the Ombudsman ’ s investigation was that the applicant was placed in solitary confinement in order to ensure his own protection. However, the Court does not consider that this reason can justify the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement (see, mutatis mutandis, Lelièvre v. Belgium, no. 11287/03, § 104, 8 November 2007 ). Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s subsequent explanation of the reasons for the applicant being placed in solitary confinement – namely, for the preservation of discipline and order, the protection of the interests of the applicant himself and of other prisoners and discipline – given that this explanation was first advanced in their observations to the Court. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant was detained in solitary confinement for reasons which are unclear and which were never explained to him. The Court observes in this regard that a solitary confinement measure is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. Despite the gravity of the measure, there is no evidence that the authorities assessed all the relevant factors in the applicant ’ s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, § 83). It is also of significance that although instructions were given on 31 October 2003 to release the applicant from solitary confinement, the instructions were misplaced and as a consequence the applicant spent a further seven days in solitary confinement after his release had been ordered."

He should be given an opportunity to express his views and there should be a possibility to appeal to authorities outside the prison should he wish to challenge the decision to place him in solitary confinement or to extend the duration of such confinement. Further, the confinement should be re-examined at regular intervals and should cease when no longer merited.

The Court refers to the CPT ’ s conclusion following the visit to Cyprus that there was a lacuna in the Prison Regulations as regards the guarantees to be afforded to those placed in solitary confinement. In the present case, the Court emphasises the lack of an adequate justification for the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement, the uncertainty concerning its duration, the failure to put in place a reliable system to record solitary confinement measures and to ensure that the applicant was not confined beyond the authorised period, the absence of any evidence that the authorities carried out an assessment of the relevant factors before ordering his confinement and the lack of any possibility to challenge the nature of his detention or its conditions."

It is clear from the entries in the logbook that the applicant ’ s cell had neither sanitary facilities nor running water. Accordingly, the applicant was required to ask the prison guards to allow him to go to the toilet. The Court ’ s examination of the prison logbook shows that on a number of occasions the applicant only used the toilet once in the course of the day, which would appear to confirm his assertion that during certain periods of his detention he had to use water bottles and nylon bags for his needs.

In its report on Cyprus, the CPT did not comment on the physical conditions of cells in Nicosia Central Prison, except to say that material conditions in cells used for administrative separation or disciplinary purposes in block 8 were adequate. The Ombudsman, in her report on the applicant ’ s complaints, did not consider the physical conditions of the applicant ’ s detention. However, the Court notes that the applicant sustained an injury to his shoulder, which he alleges was a result of the cold and damp of the cell. The Government do not dispute the allegation.

It is clear from the prison logbook that the time spent by the applicant outside his cell was limited. Although, according to the prison logbook, he visited court on seven occasions, for the remainder of his solitary confinement he rarely left his cell. Most days, the cell was opened only for a brief period to allow him to use the shower or toilet or to collect his food. In this regard, the Court notes that in Cenbauer v. Croatia (cited above, § 49) it considered that the period of the applicant ’ s confinement to his cell, between 7p.m. and 7a.m. and for several hours during the day, was “substantial”. Furthermore, it is also clear from the prison logbook that human contact was mostly limited to the applicant ’ s dealings with prison staff and his visits to court. The CPT, in its report on Cyprus, condemned the absolute prohibition on contact with the outside world attendant on solitary confinement in Cyprus, insisting that restrictions on visits should be based only on security concerns of an appreciable nature or on the availability of resources."

In the applicant ’ s case, the letters were not stopped: they were subsequently forwarded to the Ombudsman and Attorney-General, the parties to whom they were addressed. The delay of approximately three to four weeks in the delivery of the applicant ’ s correspondence was compatible with the requirements of Article 8. In this regard, the Government referred to the Court ’ s finding in Silver and Others ( cited above, § 10 4 ) where the Court found a delay of three weeks to allow instructions to be sought on a prisoner ’ s correspondence to be compatible with the requirements of Article 8."

He complained that his letters had been stopped and that he was never informed of this fact. He did not provide any details of the letters allegedly involved.

Although monitoring could, under the terms of regulation 115(7), result in the prohibition of the sending of particular letters, in the absence of further details from the applicant, there is no evidence that any letters written by him were stopped by the prison authorities.

Accordingly, the Court sees no reason to disagree with the Government and finds that the Prison Regulations can be considered “law” for the purposes of Article 8 § 2. However, although the Prison Regulations permit the monitoring of correspondence addressed to official authorities of the Republic, correspondence with the Court does not fall within the categories listed in regulation 115( 7 ) of the Prison Regulations.

The Court observes that Article 17 of the Cyprus Constitution guarantees respect for the secrecy of correspondence except in cases of, inter alia, convicted prisoners and in accordance with the law. No reference is made in Article 17 to the need for any interference to be necessary in a democratic society. The Court has previously considered the quality of the law to be deficient and thus found a violation of Article 8 § 1 where the domestic system provided for automatic screening of prisoners ’ correspondence, on the basis that such an approach did not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners could correspond and that the relevant provisions did not lay down any principles governing the exercise of the screening. In particular, they failed to specify the manner and the time-frame within which it should be effected. As screening was automatic, the authorities were not obliged to give a reasoned decision specifying grounds on which it had been effected (see, inter alia, Niedbała v. Poland, no. 27915/95, § 81, 4 July 2000; and Sałapa v. Poland, no. 35489/97, § 97, 19 December 2002. See also Petrov v.

However, the Court would make two observations in this regard. First, in respect of the defined categories, the monitoring was automatic and there was no procedure for the applicant to challenge the application of the monitoring procedure to those categories of recipients. Second, although the categories of “ politicians ” and “ mass media ” are relatively well-defined and restricted, the same cannot be said of the category of “official authority of the Republic ”, which would appear to cover a variety of bodies and institutions, including at the relevant time the Ombudsman."

However, it provides no time-limits to ensure that monitoring does not result in excessive delays, nor does it envisage the direct participation or involvement of prisoners at any stage in the monitoring process. Regulation 115(7) simply provides that a prisoner will be informed of a decision to prohibit the sending of a letter."

Finally, regulation 115(7) does not require prison authorities to provide reasons for any decision to subject a prisoner ’ s letter to closer scrutiny, and in particular to send it for further inspection to the Ministry of Justice. In the present case, the prison authorities did not explain to the applicant at the time of the interference with his correspondence why these letters were sent for further inspection before being forwarded to their intended recipients. The applicant did not receive a reasoned decision specifying the grounds on which the referral had been made. Before this Court, the Government argued that the measure was intended to protect the rights of the applicant, the Ombudsman and other State authorities. They contended that the inspection and consequent delay was necessary in order to ensure that officials did not receive excessive number of letters from prisoners on subjects over which they had no competence, which were insulting or which were improper. However, the Court notes that the Government do not explain why it was considered that the applicant ’ s letters potentially fell within the categories outlined in regulation 115(7), such that their further inspection by the Ministry of Justice was thought necessary.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasises that where measures interfering with prisoners ’ correspondence are taken, it is essential that reasons be given for the interference, such that the applicant and/or his advisers can satisfy themselves that the law has been correctly applied to him and that decisions taken in his case are not unreasonable or arbitrary. The Court further emphasises the Ombudsman ’ s role as a guardian of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the importance of respect for the confidentiality of correspondence of prisoners with the Ombudsman since it could – and in this case did – concern allegations against the prison authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 62, Series A no. 233 ).

They found that the applicant, who was severely addicted to drugs, had not received drug substitution treatment prior to his current detention in Kaisheim Prison.

The applicant had neither been given substitution treatment in the clinic, nor had the doctors recommended substitution treatment in prison. After three years in detention, he no longer suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms. Moreover, his condition with regard to his HIV and hepatitis C infections was stable and did not require any therapy for which substitution treatment was a necessary precondition. As suggested by the prison doctor, the applicant should use the opportunity to wean himself off opioids, such as heroin and its substitutes, while in prison, as it was very difficult to obtain drugs there."

In prison, these risks were not present. Furthermore, the applicant had already shown that substitution therapy while he was at liberty had not prevented him from consuming other drugs or committing crimes, which had been caused by his antisocial nature.

The aims of drug substitution therapy included securing the survival of the patient, the reduction of the use of other drugs, the stabilisation of the patient ’ s health and the treatment of further diseases, the participation in social and work life and a drug-free life. Paragraph 2 of the Guidelines provides that drug substitution treatment is indicated in cases of manifest opiate addiction as defined by the International Classification of Diseases if, in the circumstances of the case, it has more prospects of success than abstinence ‑ based therapies. In individual reasoned cases, drug substitution treatment may also be started in case of drug addicts who are currently abstinent but placed in a protective environment such as a prison. Paragraph 8 of the Guidelines provides that in case of imprisonment, the continuity of the substitution treatment by the institution in which the patient is placed is to be secured.

A study commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Health and carried out by the University of Dresden, published in 2011, on Predictors, Moderators and Outcome on Substitution Treatments (the PREMOS study) confirmed that opioid addiction was a serious chronic disease. Drug substitution treatment had been tested for the first time in the United States of America in 1949 and has been considered subsequently as both an established and the best possible therapy for opioid addiction. One of the commonly used medications for drug substitution therapy is methadone, a synthetic opioid with strong pain-killing effects. Long-term substitution treatment had proved effective in that the primary aims of that treatment ( that is, continuity of treatment, securing survival, reduction of drug consumption, stabilisation of comorbidity and social participation) were attained. Stable abstinence from opioids was a rare phenomenon in the long run ( attained by less than 4 % of the opioid addicts examined ) and was associated with considerable risks (notably death). The termination of substitution treatment should therefore be envisaged only if, in particular, there was a stable motivation and a good psycho-social environment and treatment of the patient (see pp. 4 -15 and 125-133 of the study report).",

The Court further reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention imposes on the State a positive obligation to ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject the individual to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, the person ’ s health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, the provision of the requisite medical assistance and treatment (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; McGlinchey and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 50390/99, § 46, ECHR 2003 ‑ V; and Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, § 51, 2 December 2004 ). In this connection, the “adequacy” of medical assistance remains the most difficult element to determine. Medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see, inter alia, Blokhin, cited above, § 137 )."

In the event of diverging medical opinions on the treatment necessary to ensure adequately a prisoner ’ s health, it may be necessary for the prison authorities and the domestic courts, in order to comply with their positive obligation under Article 3, to obtain additional advice from a specialised medical expert (compare Xiros, cited above, §§ 87 and 89 -90; and Budanov v. Russia, no. 66583/11, § 73, 9 January 2014 ). The authorities ’ refusal to allow independent specialised medical assistance to be given to a prisoner suffering from a serious medical condition on his request is an element the Court has taken into account in its assessment of the State ’ s compliance with Article 3 (compare, for instance, Sarban v.

This holds true, in particular, where medical research does not lead to a clear result as to which of two or more possible therapies is more suitable for the patient concerned. The Court, having regard to the material before it, is aware of the fact that drug substitution therapy with methadone entails the replacement of an illicit drug with a synthetic opioid. While drug substitution treatment has become increasingly widespread in the Council of Europe Member States during the past years, the measures to be taken to treat drug addiction are still the subject of controversy. The States ’ margin of appreciation in respect of the choice of medical treatment for a prisoner ’ s diseases applies, in principle, also to the choice between abstinence-oriented drug therapy and drug substitution therapy and to the setting-up of a general policy in this field, as long as the State ensures that the standards set by the Convention in the field of medical care in prison are complied with."

In this context, the Court notes that there are a number of strong elements indicating that drug substitution treatment could be regarded as the requisite medical treatment for the applicant in view of the following. First, it is uncontested between the parties that the applicant is a manifest and long-term opioid addict. At the relevant time of the domestic authorities ’ decisions, he had been addicted to heroin for some forty years. All his attempts to overcome his addiction, including five in-house drug rehabilitation therapies, had failed. In the light of these circumstances, a domestic court itself had confirmed, in proceedings related to those here at issue, that it could no longer be expected with sufficient probability that the applicant could be cured of his drug addiction or prevented for a considerable time from relapsing into drug abuse (see paragraph 8 above). It is further uncontested that the applicant suffered from chronic pain linked to his long-term drug consumption and polyneuropathy."

In view of his state of health, prior to his detention here at issue, the applicant ’ s heroin addiction had been treated with medically prescribed and supervised drug substitution therapy for seventeen years, from 1991 until 2008. The Court notes in this context that according to the relevant domestic guidelines, that is, the Federal Medical Association ’ s Guidelines for the Substitution Treatment of Opiate Addicts of 19 February 2010, adopted in accordance with section 5 § 11 of the Prescription of Narcotic Substances Regulation, opiate addiction was a serious chronic disease requiring medical treatment. It is further clarified that substitution treatment was a scientifically tested therapy for manifest opiate addiction (see paragraph 30 above). According to a study commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Health, drug substitution treatment was to be considered as an established therapy and the best possible therapy in that case (see paragraph 31 above). The statistical data before the Court show, accordingly, that opioid substitution therapy programmes were operational already at the relevant time of the proceedings at issue in 41 out of 47 of the Council of Europe Member States in the community and 30 out of 47 of those State also provided such therapy to prisoners (see paragraphs 3 6 - 3 7 above)."

The Court further observes that it is uncontested by the Government that drug substitution therapy is, in principle, available in prisons in Germany, as it is outside prison, and is actually provided in practice in prisons in several Länder other than Bavaria. The applicable provisions of domestic law (section 13 of the Narcotic Substances Act, read in conjunction with section 5 of the Prescription of Narcotic Substances Regulation and paragraph 8 of the Federal Medical Association ’ s Guidelines for the Substitution Treatment of Opiate Addicts ) specify, in particular, that in case of imprisonment, the continuity of the substitution treatment started outside prison by the institution in which the patient is placed, is to be secured ( see paragraph 30 above )."

R (98) 7 concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison, lay down the principle of equivalence of care. Under that principle, prisoners are entitled to medical treatment in conditions comparable to those enjoyed by patients in the outside community and should have access to the health services available in the country without discrimination on grounds of their legal situation (see paragraphs 32-34 above and for the Court ’ s own definition paragraph 5 5 above )."

The Court further observes that not only the doctors having prescribed the applicant drug substitution therapy prior to his detention considered that treatment to be necessary in the applicant ’ s case. An external doctor for internal medicine commissioned by the prison authorities, H., who had examined the applicant in person, had suggested that the prison medical service, who had not considered it necessary to provide the applicant with such treatment, reconsider granting the applicant drug substitution treatment (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, a doctor specialised in drug addiction treatment (B.) had equally confirmed, albeit only on the basis of the written findings of doctor H., that from a medical point of view, drug substitution treatment had to be provided to the applicant (see paragraph 11 above)."

The Court would refer in this context to its case-law under which it is for the Government to provide convincing evidence showing that the applicant concerned received comprehensive and adequate medical care in detention (see paragraph 5 8 above ). It notes that abstinence-oriented therapy constituted a radical change in the medical treatment the applicant had received for seventeen years prior to his detention and that the domestic courts, based on the opinion of the treating doctors in the drug detoxification centre, considered that this therapy had failed. The Court finds that, in these circumstances, the domestic authorities were under an obligation to examine with particular scrutiny if maintaining the abstinence ‑ oriented therapy was to be considered as appropriate."

The Court considers, in this context, the authorities ’ argument that, at the time when the applicant was transferred from the drug rehabilitation centre to Kaisheim Prison, where he applied for drug substitution treatment, he had not been provided with drug substitution therapy for several months and no longer suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms. However, in the Court ’ s view, this element does not militate against the potential necessity of drug substitution treatment. The applicant ’ s health in detention was characterised, in particular, by chronic pain which he suffered independently of previous physical withdrawal symptoms. Moreover, it emerges from the material before the Court that the treatment with Polamidon was interrupted against the applicant ’ s will, and apparently contrary to what is provided by the above ‑ mentioned Federal Medical Association Guidelines (see paragraph 30 above), at the outset of his detention and during his stay in the drug rehabilitation centre, where abstinence- based treatment for his addiction was carried out without additional substitution treatment. The authorities cannot, therefore, rely on a situation which they themselves brought about. Furthermore, given that the abstinence-oriented therapy had failed both in the view of the treating doctors in the drug detoxification centre and in the view of the domestic courts (see paragraph 8 above), the authorities were called upon to assess anew which therapy was suitable for the applicant."

The Court further considers that its above findings are not called into question by the Government ’ s argument that drug substitution therapy would run counter to the aim of rehabilitating the applicant by making him overcome his drug addiction in prison and thus enabling him to lead a life free of illegal drugs outside prison. The Court considers that this objective is, in principle, a legitimate aim which may be taken into account in the assessment of the necessity of the medical treatment of a drug addict. However, the Court notes that in the applicant ’ s case, the authorities themselves had considered, prior to refusing the applicant drug substitution treatment in the proceedings at issue, that having regard to his history of drug addiction, this aim could not reasonably be expected to be attained. In particular, the Court of Appeal, when confirming the termination of the applicant ’ s treatment in a detoxification facility after consultation of the applicant ’ s treating doctors, considered that it could no longer be expected with sufficient probability that the applicant could be cured of his drug addiction (see paragraph 8 above)."

The authorities ’ assessment in this respect is equally confirmed by medical research showing that stable abstinence from opioids was a rare phenomenon and should, in the case of manifest opioid addicts, only be attempted if the patient was motivated to attain that aim (see paragraph 31 above), which was clearly not the applicant ’ s case at the relevant time. Therefore, the refusal of drug substitution treatment could not be based on that unattainable objective."

Furthermore, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that providing the applicant with substitution treatment would have put his life and limb in jeopardy as he might have consumed additional illegal drugs in prison. In the Government ’ s submission, he therefore also had not met the requirements for drug substitution treatment under section 5 § 2 of the Prescription of Narcotic Substances Regulation. The Court considers that this argument is somewhat at odds with another argument the authorities forwarded in the context of their refusal to provide substitution treatment, namely that it was very difficult to obtain opioids in prison. In any event, the Court observes that this risk appeared to have been manageable even in the community over the previous seventeen years during which the applicant had received drug substitution treatment. In contrast, the risk caused to the life and limb of a drug addict who was released from prison without substitution treatment was acknowledged also by the prison authorities (see paragraph 25 above). The Court therefore finds that this element equally did not exempt the domestic authorities from analysing in detail the suitable treatment options for the applicant."

The Court would add that it is aware that medical treatment in the prison context may entail additional difficulties and challenges for the domestic authorities, notably those related to security concerns. However, the Government have not forwarded any reasons for finding that providing the applicant with drug substitution treatment was incompatible with the practical demands of imprisonment. In contrast, as expert B. had stressed, such treatment would help prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C from which the applicant suffered, in the interests of his fellow prisoners and the community as a whole. The Court further accepts that the provision of such treatment may serve to diminish the trafficking and uncontrolled consumption of illegal drugs in prison."

The necessary medical treatment adequately addressing the prisoner ’ s state of health must also be determined with the help of the medical expert and provided to the detainee. The Court notes in this context that the importance of drawing on external medical experts providing specialised assistance to addicts in order to provide prisoners with appropriate treatment is equally stressed in the Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation no.

However, there is no indication that the domestic authorities, with the help of medical expert advice, examined the necessity of drug substitution treatment with regard to the criteria set by the relevant domestic legislation and medical guidelines.

It notes that, while the applicant was found no longer to suffer from the physical withdrawal symptoms which occur at the beginning of forced abstinence, the – albeit limited – material before the Court, in particular external doctor H. ’ s assessment, suggests that the chronic pain from which the applicant was suffering throughout the relevant period could have been alleviated more effectively with drug substitution treatment than with the painkillers he received. It was also not contested that this pain in his feet, neck and spine was such that, at least during certain periods of time during the applicant ’ s detention at issue, some three and a half years, the applicant spent most of his time in bed. The Court further accepts that his suffering was exacerbated by the fact that he was aware of the existence of a treatment which had previously alleviated his pain effectively, but which he was refused."

The applicant also made it plausible that the deterioration of his already poor state of health, and in particular his chronic pain, combined with his craving for heroin, reduced his ability to participate in social life. In the light of these elements, the Court is satisfied that the physical and mental strain the applicant suffered as a result of his health condition as such could, in principle, exceed the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and attain the threshold of Article 3. The domestic authorities therefore had to properly evaluate which was the adequate treatment for his disease in order to secure that he received adequate medical care but, as shown above, failed to prove that the applicant ’ s treatment with painkillers alone was sufficient in the circumstances."

In coming to this conclusion, the Court bears in mind the particular circumstances of the applicant ’ s case as a long ‑ term drug addict without any realistic chance of overcoming addiction and having received substitution treatment for many years.

Neither the medical reports nor certificates issued by the authorities contained any analysis of the adequacy of the applicant ’ s medical treatment or the compatibility of the conditions of his detention with his state of health.

At no point during the examination did the doctors from the prison hospital assess the applicant ’ s state of health independently without reference to that list, or evaluate whether his illness, given its manifestation, nature and duration at that point in time, required his transfer to a specialist hospital.

The Governor relied on a medical report issued by the head of the Health Establishment ( Zakład Opieki Zdrowotnej ) at Siedlce Prison on 20 June 2006 and submitted that, despite the fact that the applicant had been doing some rehabilitation exercises on his own, muscular dystrophy, contractures in the hips and knees, and a general deterioration in his health had been observed. The applicant therefore required advanced physiotherapy, which could not be provided within the prison system. Although Łódź Prison would be prepared to offer the applicant basic physiotherapy, it could not do so before September 2006.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness.",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non ‑ exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement.",

The Court held in these judgments that overcrowding in Polish detention facilities had been, at the relevant time, of a structural nature what undermined the effectiveness of any domestic remedies available, making them theoretical and illusory and incapable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaint ( ibid. § 111). The Court, nevertheless, indicated that where the alleged violation no longer continued and could not, therefore, be eliminated with retrospective effect, the only means of redress was pecuniary compensation. In such situations, regard being had to the principle of subsidiarity, it could not be excluded that applicants who complained of degrading treatment because of the conditions of their detention, might be required to first avail themselves of the civil action relied on by the Government (ibid. § 109 )."

The Court considered that it was neither mandated nor in a position to obtain and examine evidence necessary to rule on the existence of a causal link between the applicant ’ s treatment in prison and his state of health after his release. In addition, it was also significant that the applicant had lodged his application with the Court in early 2009, seven months after his detention had begun and less than three months after it ended. Most importantly, at the time when the case was being decided by the Court, the applicant had still had time to bring a civil action under Article 23, taken in conjunction with Article 417 or Article 448 of the Civil Code, in order to seek compensation for the alleged violation.

On 22 October 1993 the Liège Court of Appeal set aside the injunction of 10 May 1993 and ruled that there were no grounds for using the summary procedure. It held in particular that implementation of a mental health board’s decisions was an administrative act which fell outside the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and that in the present case the administrative authorities had not committed a trespass to the person which was actionable in the civil courts. It gave the following reasons for its judgment:",
                "“The respondents are subject to a detention order and Paifve Social Protection Centre was designated, by the Mental Health Board’s decisions of ... and … respectively, as the place where they were to be detained. They have not been transferred there and are still being held in Lantin Prison psychiatric wing. The appellant submits that, because of a shortage of places in the Paifve Social Protection Centre, it has been obliged to draw up a waiting-list, on a ‘first come, first served’ basis, and that the person at the top of the list is transferred to Paifve as soon as a place becomes available as a result of the release of another inmate whose condition has improved. The appellant adds that extensive work has been carried out in order to increase the capacity of Paifve Social Protection Centre and that the opening of a new building there on 1 October 1993 has already enabled several detainees on the waiting-list to be transferred; that the others will be admitted there gradually, for security reasons and to allow the supervisory personnel time to familiarise themselves with their duties (see the director’s report of 1 October 1993); and that it is possible that the respondents will very shortly benefit from the opening of this new building.",
                "Although the respondents clearly have a right to be transferred to an institution where they will receive a scientifically organised course of treatment devised by psychiatric staff, it has to be recognised that in Paifve the chronic overcrowding, resulting in a deplorable lack of privacy not conducive to successful treatment, is now coupled with a marked lack of security and premises that are close to being unhygienic, so that treatment there is failing (see the descriptions in two cases in Liège Court of First Instance (Injunction Proceedings), one of 27.2.1990, reported in JLMB [ Revue de Jurisprudence de Liège, Mons et Bruxelles ] 1990, 435 and one of 4.6.1993 (Belgium v. B., C. and T., complaint no. R.F. 8349/93). The appellant has had to postpone transferring inmates subject to detention orders to this centre lest this worsen the situation, and has introduced the waiting-list system, which has been severely disrupted by a number of injunctions – accompanied by high penalties – giving certain inmates priority for reasons difficult to justify. The fact that the appellant has complied with these decisions – essentially because of the burden represented by the penalties – cannot be interpreted as meaning that it has decided once and for all to waive any challenge to the ordinary courts’ power to intervene in this area; circumstances which suggest that a right has been waived must be interpreted narrowly and such a waiver can be deduced only where those circumstances are not open to any other interpretation (Cass. [Court of Cassation] 20.4.1989, reported in Pas. [Pasicrisie] 1989, I, 861).",
                "Unlike decisions on the release of an inmate subject to a detention order, which count as judgments ( jugements ) by virtue of their subject matter (see Cass. 17.6.1968 in Pas. 1968, I, 1183, and the opinion of Advocate-General Mahaux), mental health board decisions designating the institution in which a person subject to such an order is to be detained do not concern liberty of person, but only the manner in which a detention order is to be executed (see O. Vandemeulebroeke, ‘ Les commissions de défense sociale ’, RDP [ Revue de droit pénal et de criminologie ], 1986, p. 178, § 80). By their very nature, they are not covered by Article 30 of the Constitution.",
                "The execution of these decisions is an administrative act, not a regulation ( règlement ) governed by Article 107 of the Constitution.",
                "The appellant does not deny the respondents’ right to be transferred to Paifve, but argues that they should not be transferred immediately because of the overcrowding there, the resulting disorder and the potential security problems both for staff and other citizens. The decision to continue to hold the surplus numbers of mentally disturbed offenders in prison psychiatric wings is therefore a choice which the authorities have made after weighing the detainees’ right to the most appropriate medical treatment against general security requirements.",
                "That choice is an administrative act of exactly the sort not subject to review by the ordinary courts.",
                "Although the ordinary courts have jurisdiction to order the measures necessary to end or prevent any wrongful infringement of an individual right, they are prohibited from examining the appropriateness of a measure taken by an administrative authority, and from acting as an administrative authority (see the conclusions of Mr Velu, now Principal State Counsel but at that time Advocate-General, in Cass. 27.6.1980, Pas. 1980, I, p. 1357, and in particular p. 1349; and Cass. 27.11.1992, RG 7972, Belgium v. V.D.E. (in liquidation)). A judge dealing with applications for injunctions cannot, without interfering with the administration’s general policy, question the expediency of a decision to draw up a waiting-list and disrupt the order of that list by ruling, under threat of a penalty, that a mentally-disturbed offender cared for in less favourable conditions in a psychiatric wing must be transferred immediately. There must, in any event, be other possibilities for transfer, since a mental health board – and in cases of emergency, the chairman alone – can, even of its own motion, send an inmate to another State-run – or, in exceptional cases, private – institution.",
                "The only court which has considered this issue on the merits found (see Liège Court of First Instance (Civil Proceedings), case of H. and V. v. Belgium, 16.2.1993) that the detention was nevertheless still legal, thus ruling out the existence of an arbitrary trespass to the person. The shortage of places in prisons no doubt justifies the building of additional accommodation, but this work – besides being impossible to complete overnight – entails financial commitments which are a matter of general policy not subject to review by the courts. The opening of the new building at Paifve is an illustration of the appellant’s concern about the problem of dealing with persons subject to detention orders.",
                "The observations made in 1990 by the President of the Liège Court of First Instance, on the basis of an inspection of the premises and a judicial investigation, provide a clear comparison between the regimes and types of treatment provided for the inmates at Paifve and in the Lantin psychiatric wing; this comparison excludes any need for a new inspection and enables this court to draw the conclusion that, although the situation of mentally disturbed offenders in Lantin is not ideal, and may jeopardise their recovery, the regime under which they – including the respondents – live there cannot be likened to inhuman or degrading treatment as prohibited by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.”",

I work there for ten hours a week: two hours on Mondays, three hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and one hour on Fridays and Saturdays. The scope of my work is vast, as I am in theory responsible for looking after all the prisoners in Lantin (about 700 of them), not just the inmates of the psychiatric wing. It is the only prison in Belgium where there is only one neuropsychiatrist for so many prisoners and people subject to detention orders. I spend three-fifths of my time in the psychiatric wing. There are many different types of inmate: people under detention orders; drug addicts who are sent to the wing when they first arrive in Lantin (new ones arrive almost every day); prisoners – on remand or convicted – with a wide range of mental disorders; and finally, people undergoing psychiatric observation, particularly at the request of an investigating judge. The wing has 42 beds, including three for prisoner-helpers, but in fact there are between 35 and 55 inmates. During the holidays there are about 47 to 49. The dormitory has 23 beds and there are 13 cells, currently housing 17 people under detention orders. The figure 40 is much too high, as these people need a lot of psychiatric and neurological care, and occupational therapy. They require treatment for acute problems, which is given. They should also be treated on an ongoing basis with a view to their social rehabilitation. They should have regular consultations with psychologists and social workers. I also think it is essential for them to be given work. And yet this ongoing treatment is non-existent.",

There should be five supervisors per shift, but there are often only four and sometimes even three. The presence of these supervisors is very important for the inmates: they are there to listen to them, talk to them, stay on the ward and play games with those who want to, which is practically impossible given the high number of inmates and the low number of supervisors. They are also supposed to supervise the inmates’ visits and the exercise yard. One of these supervisors, who is not a nurse, has to prepare the medication. There is no psychologist, and no occupational therapist, although one is needed to make work part of therapy. There is no tutor. There is only one social worker, who also works in other parts of Lantin (particularly with the women prisoners). The inmates under detention orders are also given a few music, English and French lessons by volunteer teachers, but much more could be done...",

They are therefore ‘placed’ on a waiting-list in chronological order.",

Similarly, an appeal decision of the same court of 16 February 1993 held that the Prison Service could rely on the defence of force majeure as it had neither the premises nor the staff to comply properly with the Social Protection Act.",
                "Although no such case is currently pending before the Court of Cassation, it should be pointed out that on 8 August 1994 a person subject to a detention order lodged an application against Belgium with the European Commission of Human Rights. This case is still pending at the present time.",

The renovation project is planned for the medium term (1999–2000).",

However, this increased capacity would obviously not save the boards having to send people to Tournai EDS, which has specialised equipment and staff. It is important to retain that possibility since Ministry of Justice and private institutions alone are totally insufficient to meet the demand.",

Moreover, the rejection of his application for legal aid for an appeal to the Court of Cassation against the above-mentioned judgment of 22 October 1993 had infringed his right of access to a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6.

The type of security measure and the time and manner of its use depend on the particular circumstances of the case and the personality of the detainee. The use of force should be preceded by a warning if the circumstances so allow. If the use of force cannot be avoided, it should not exceed the level necessary for fulfilment by the officers of their duties and should be carried out so as to inflict as little injury as possible.

The legal formulation of the rule and exceptions to it could, in the Court ’ s view, generally result in an over-inclusive regime. This conclusion goes hand in hand with the findings of the 2009 CPT report, which underlined that the procedure for allocating a prisoner “N” status fails to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream prison population are accorded this status (see paragraph 72 above). Also, given the absence of any provisions linking that status with a person ’ s actual behaviour in prison, the legal framework of the “N” regime seems to be too rigid and not sufficiently oriented towards the individual circumstances of a particular detainee.",

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the decision of 22 July 2004 imposing the “dangerous detainee” regime on the applicant was a legitimate measure, warranted by the fact that in one of two parallel criminal proceedings conducted against him at that time, namely in case no. III K 120/06 before the Kraków Regional Court, he had been charged with drug-related offences committed in an armed organised criminal group (see paragraphs 14 and 23 above). It was not, therefore, unreasonable on the part of the authorities to consider that, for the sake of ensuring prison security, he should be subjected to tighter security controls, involving increased and constant supervision of his movements within and outside his cell, limitations on his contact and communication with the outside world and some form of segregation from the prison community.",
                "As the Court has already held in similar cases concerning organised crime, in particular those lodged by persons linked to Mafia-type organisations, the existing, continuing danger that an applicant may re ‑ establish contact with criminal organisations is an element that may justify applying even harsh isolation measures in order to exclude such a possibility (see, for instance, Messina (no.2) (dec.), cited above). In the applicant ’ s case that risk had to be taken into account and further increased in 2005, following his conviction in case no. III K 120/06 and, subsequently, in January 2006, when the charges of leading an armed organised criminal group involved in, among other things, drug-trafficking, bribery of public officials, extortion, kidnapping and arms and ammunition trafficking were laid against him. He was convicted of these offences by the first-instance court apparently in 2009 (see paragraphs 15-17 above).",
                "Also, the monitoring of a detainee ’ s behaviour via close-circuit television at all times, as in the present case, although certainly intrusive, is not per se incompatible with Article 3. This measure serves the purposes of both ensuring prison security and protecting the detainee from the risk of pressure or even physical attack from the criminal community which, in the context of organised crime, cannot be excluded."

Throughout this time he has been completely segregated from other inmates. All his repeated, numerous requests for placing another person in his cell were to no avail (see paragraphs 23 and 28-29 above). While he must have maintained a degree of daily contact with the prison staff, even if only for the sake of a daily walk (see paragraphs 30 and 45-47 above), his opportunities of communication, if only superficial, with other people in prison was very seriously reduced, nearly non-existent.",

The Court does not overlook the ever present need to prevent any flow of illicit information between a gang leader and the outside world. Nevertheless, in the Court ’ s view, this – again very limited – possibility of human contact could not attenuate sufficiently the consequences of his nearly complete, prolonged isolation and his daily solitude for his mental and emotional well ‑ being."

In that report the authorities were explicitly criticised for not having developed “a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities”. It was recommended that “educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with “N” status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day” (see paragraph 71 above).

For reasons which were never explained in the relevant decisions, they did not consider it fit to place another inmate with him – be it for a short or trial term – even though this solution was explicitly provided under the 2003 Ordinance (see paragraphs 24-28 and 47 above).",

Hungary, cited above, § 30, with further references). Considering the duration of the regime imposed on the applicant and the very limited possibilities available to him for physical movement and human contact, the Court has no doubt that his prolonged solitude must have caused him serious distress and mental suffering."

Moreover, in contrast to a personal check, which the authorities are expressly obliged to carry out pursuant to Article 212b § 1(5), handcuffing a detainee with his hands behind the back should only take place if “a person is aggressive or dangerous” (see paragraph 45 above). It does not appear that there was a permanent need to do so in the applicant ’ s case, given that in the prison he remained in a secure environment and other means of direct and indirect control of his behaviour were at the same time applied."

                "100. The Court also has misgivings in respect to the personal check to which the applicant was likewise subjected daily, or even several times a day, whenever he left or entered his cell. The Court is aware of the necessity to prevent a gangster from smuggling objects and/or communications out of his cell. Nevertheless, the strip-search, involving an anal inspection, was carried out as a matter of routine and was not linked to any concrete security needs, nor to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant ’ s conduct. It was performed despite the fact that outside his cell and the “N” ward he could move around the remand centre only by himself under a permanent and direct supervision of at least 2 prison guards and that his mobility was restricted due to his being handcuffed – in a stressful position with hands behind his back – all the time. In addition, his behaviour in the cell, including his use of sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via close ‑ circuit television (see paragraphs 24, 26, 30, 47, 49 and 51-56 above ).",
                "In this connection, the Court would again refer to the 2009 CPT report in which it expressed its considerable concern about the practice of strip ‑ searches applied to persons classified as dangerous detainees, in the following way: “[t]he CPT also has serious misgivings about the systematic practice of obliging “N” status prisoners to undergo routine strip-searches whenever entering or leaving their cells. The prisoners concerned had to undress completely, and squat fully naked in view of the guards and any prisoner(s) sharing the cell while their clothes were examined. In the CPT ’ s opinion, such a practice could be considered amounting to degrading treatment.” (see paragraph 73 above)."

Poland, no 25196 /94, 15 November 2001, § 59; and Van der Ven, cited above, § 60, with further references). However, it is not persuaded that systematic, intrusive and exceptionally embarrassing checks performed on the applicant daily, or even several times a day, were necessary to ensure safety in prison. Having regard to the fact that the applicant was already subjected in addition to several other strict surveillance measures, that the authorities did not rely on any concrete convincing security needs and that, despite the serious charges against him, he apparently did not display any disruptive, violent or otherwise dangerous behaviour in prison, the Court considers that the practice of daily strip-searches applied to him for 7 years and some 9 months, combined with his nearly complete social isolation, must have diminished his human dignity and caused him feelings of inferiority, anguish and accumulated distress which went beyond the unavoidable suffering and humiliation involved in the imposition of detention on remand (see Van de Ven, cited above, § 62 and paragraph 86 above)."

Lastly, the Court would add that due to the strict, rigid rules for the imposition of the special regime and the vaguely defined “exceptional circumstances” justifying its discontinuation laid down in Article 212a § 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, the authorities, in extending that regime, were not in fact obliged to consider any changes in the applicant ’ s personal situation and, in particular, the combined effects of the continued application of the impugned measures (see paragraphs 44 and 93 above). Those rules – and this was also noted by the CPT – do not provide for adequate solutions enabling the authorities, if necessary, to adjust the regime to individual conduct or to reduce the negative impact of social isolation (see paragraphs 44-47 and 71-72 above).",
                "In the present case the authorities did not ever refer to any likelihood of the applicant ’ s escaping in the event of his being detained under a less strict regime. However, neither the apparent absence of such risk, nor the adverse emotional and mental effects of isolation as alleged by the applicant, were considered circumstances sufficient to justify lifting any of the strict measures applied under the regime (see paragraphs 24-29 above). In that context, the Court would again recall that, as stated above (see paragraph 92 above), in cases involving solitary confinement the authorities should act with special caution in imposing that measure and should examine carefully all the specific circumstances militating for or against its continuation.",
                "In contrast, it emerges from the relevant decisions that, apart from the original grounds based essentially on the admittedly very serious nature of the charges against the applicant, which included the leading of an armed organised criminal group involved in violent offences and on his “leadership qualities and tendency to dominate the others”, as well as his “ serious lack of moral character ”, subsequently the authorities did not find any other reasons for classifying him as a “dangerous detainee” (see paragraphs 23-27 above). While those circumstances could justify the imposition of the “N” regime on the applicant for a certain, even relatively long, period (see paragraph 9 3 above ), they could not suffice as a sole justification for its prolonged continuation. As pointed out by the applicant (see paragraph 8 4 above ), with the passage of time the procedure for review of his “dangerous detainee” status became a pure formality limited to a repetition of the same grounds in each successive decision."

As stated above, detention entails inherent limitations on the detainee ’ s private and family life, including restrictions on family visits or, if so justified by the nature of the offence and detainee ’ s circumstances, special arrangements for such visits (see paragraphs 12 2 -12 3 above). In particular, in cases involving high-security prison regimes where the applicants are charged with, or convicted of, a serious offence representing a considerable social danger – for instance, violent or organised Mafia-type crime – the application of such measures as a physical separation of a detainee from his visitors through a special transparent partition can be justified by the prison security needs or the danger that a detainee would communicate with criminal organisations through the family channels (see, for instance, Van der Ven, cited above, §§ 16 and 54; and Messina no. 2, cited above, §§ 27 and 72). However, the extended prohibition on direct contact with family members is accepted under Article 8 only in so far as the authorities have not failed to fulfil their duty under this provision to enable, and assist, the applicant in maintaining contact with his close family and secured a fair balance between his rights and the aims of the special regime (see Messina no. 2, cited above, §§ 72-73 and paragraphs 12 3 -12 4 above)."

Nevertheless, to justify long-term restrictions, there must exist a genuine and continuing danger of that kind (see paragraphs 9 4, 129 above and Messina (no. 2), cited above §§ 66-73). In that regard, the Court notes that the first visit from the applicant ’ s wife was an open visit enabling them direct contact and unrestricted conversation (see paragraphs 34 and 58 above). In the light of the material in the Court ’ s possession, it appears that neither this first visit, nor any further events or the applicant ’ s own behaviour during his detention (see paragraphs 84 and 10 1 - 10 2 above) revealed any grounds to believe that he intended to use his wife or daughters as intermediaries to restore contacts with the criminal community or that open family visits from them would jeopardise the prison security. Indeed, subsequently, open visits were granted to the applicant each year, although rarely, at different intervals and on an irregular basis (see paragraphs 33 ‑ 38 above ). In the Court ’ s view, this shows not merely the lack of a consistent pattern in the authorities ’ decisions but also, indirectly, that in reality the measures taken were not apparently related to any tangible fear or risk that could possibly legitimise the impugned restrictions under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (cf.

However, positive obligations of the State under Article 8, in particular an obligation to enable and assist a detainee in maintaining contact with his close family (see paragraphs 12 3 -12 4 and 12 9 above), includes a duty to secure the appropriate, as stress-free for visitors as possible, conditions for receiving visits from his children, regard being had to the practical consequences of imprisonment. That duty is not discharged properly in situations where, as in the present case, the visits from children are organised in a manner exposing them to the view of prison cells and inmates and, as a result, to an inevitably traumatic, exceptionally stressful experience. The Court agrees that, as the applicant said, the exposure to prison life can be shocking even for an adult and, indeed, it must have caused inordinate distress and emotional suffering for his daughters (see paragraphs 39 and 119 above). It further notes that, owing to the authorities ’ failure to make adequate visiting arrangements, the applicant, having seen the deeply adverse effects on his daughters, had to desist from seeing them in prison. Throughout his detention from 14 July 2004 to the end of 2008 he saw his oldest daughter twice and each of the two younger ones once.

Solitary confinement or small-group isolation for extended periods is more likely to de-socialise than re-socialise people. There should instead be a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities, and educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with \"N\" status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day. As stressed in the report on the visit in 2004, regardless of the gravity of the offences of which prisoners are accused or have been convicted and/or their presumed dangerousness, efforts must be made to provide them with appropriate stimulation and, in particular, with adequate human contact. ”"

In the CPT ’ s opinion, the procedure for allocating a prisoner to ‘ N ’ status should be refined to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream of the prison population are accorded this status. Reviews of ‘ N ’ status should specify clearly what is to be done to assist the prisoner concerned to move away from the ‘ N ’ status and provide clear criteria for assessing development. Prisoners should be fully involved in all review processes.

In an ordinary system, a convict may use employment available at the penitentiary institution, as well as education and cultural-educational and sports classes. As far as such convicts are concerned, no plans are made for application of the individual programme of impact. The individual programme of impact is prepared in co-operation with the convict who declared that he wishes to serve his sentence in the system of programmed impact, which anticipates active participation of the convict in the process of re-socialization by means of fulfilment of tasks imposed upon him as part of the programme which are aimed at solving the problems constituting the grounds for the offences he committed.",

Inspection of the body and checking-up clothes and shoes is each time performed by officers of the Prison Service in a separate room, in absence of any third parties and persons of a different sex, and is performed by persons of the same sex.

The nature of the offence allegedly committed by the applicant is therefore irrelevant for the purposes of Article 3 (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV; Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, § 30, 18 October 2001; Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005- ..., § 179; and Ramirez Sanchez v.

It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. On the other hand, the Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see, among other authorities, Kudła cited above, § 92, with further references). The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or to debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, ECHR 2003-II, § 48)."

Public-order considerations may lead the State to introduce high ‑ security prison regimes for particular categories of detainees and, indeed, in many State Parties to the Convention more stringent security rules apply to dangerous detainees. These arrangements, intended to prevent the risk of escape, attack or disturbance of the prison community, are based on separation of such detainees from the prison community together with tighter controls (see, for instance, Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, §§ 80-82 and 138; Messina (no. 2) v.

The legal formulation of the rule and exceptions to it could, in the Court ’ s view, generally result in an over-inclusive regime. This conclusion goes hand in hand with the findings of the 2009 CPT report, which underlined that the procedure for allocating a prisoner “N” status fails to ensure that only those who pose an ongoing high risk if accommodated in the mainstream prison population are accorded this status (see paragraph 72 above). Also, given the absence of any provisions linking that status with a person ’ s actual behaviour in prison, the legal framework of the “N” regime seems to be too rigid and not sufficiently oriented towards the individual circumstances of a particular detainee.",

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the decision of 22 July 2004 imposing the “dangerous detainee” regime on the applicant was a legitimate measure, warranted by the fact that in one of two parallel criminal proceedings conducted against him at that time, namely in case no. III K 120/06 before the Kraków Regional Court, he had been charged with drug-related offences committed in an armed organised criminal group (see paragraphs 14 and 23 above). It was not, therefore, unreasonable on the part of the authorities to consider that, for the sake of ensuring prison security, he should be subjected to tighter security controls, involving increased and constant supervision of his movements within and outside his cell, limitations on his contact and communication with the outside world and some form of segregation from the prison community.",
                "As the Court has already held in similar cases concerning organised crime, in particular those lodged by persons linked to Mafia-type organisations, the existing, continuing danger that an applicant may re ‑ establish contact with criminal organisations is an element that may justify applying even harsh isolation measures in order to exclude such a possibility (see, for instance, Messina (no.2) (dec.), cited above). In the applicant ’ s case that risk had to be taken into account and further increased in 2005, following his conviction in case no. III K 120/06 and, subsequently, in January 2006, when the charges of leading an armed organised criminal group involved in, among other things, drug-trafficking, bribery of public officials, extortion, kidnapping and arms and ammunition trafficking were laid against him. He was convicted of these offences by the first-instance court apparently in 2009 (see paragraphs 15-17 above).",

Throughout this time he has been completely segregated from other inmates. All his repeated, numerous requests for placing another person in his cell were to no avail (see paragraphs 23 and 28-29 above). While he must have maintained a degree of daily contact with the prison staff, even if only for the sake of a daily walk (see paragraphs 30 and 45-47 above), his opportunities of communication, if only superficial, with other people in prison was very seriously reduced, nearly non-existent.",

The Court does not overlook the ever present need to prevent any flow of illicit information between a gang leader and the outside world.

In that report the authorities were explicitly criticised for not having developed “a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities”. It was recommended that “educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with “N” status prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day” (see paragraph 71 above).

Moreover, in contrast to a personal check, which the authorities are expressly obliged to carry out pursuant to Article 212b § 1(5), handcuffing a detainee with his hands behind the back should only take place if “a person is aggressive or dangerous” (see paragraph 45 above).

Nevertheless, the strip-search, involving an anal inspection, was carried out as a matter of routine and was not linked to any concrete security needs, nor to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant ’ s conduct. It was performed despite the fact that outside his cell and the “N” ward he could move around the remand centre only by himself under a permanent and direct supervision of at least 2 prison guards and that his mobility was restricted due to his being handcuffed – in a stressful position with hands behind his back – all the time.

                "In this connection, the Court would again refer to the 2009 CPT report in which it expressed its considerable concern about the practice of strip ‑ searches applied to persons classified as dangerous detainees, in the following way: “[t]he CPT also has serious misgivings about the systematic practice of obliging “N” status prisoners to undergo routine strip-searches whenever entering or leaving their cells. The prisoners concerned had to undress completely, and squat fully naked in view of the guards and any prisoner(s) sharing the cell while their clothes were examined. In the CPT ’ s opinion, such a practice could be considered amounting to degrading treatment.” (see paragraph 73 above)."

Poland, no 25196 /94, 15 November 2001, § 59; and Van der Ven, cited above, § 60, with further references). However, it is not persuaded that systematic, intrusive and exceptionally embarrassing checks performed on the applicant daily, or even several times a day, were necessary to ensure safety in prison. Having regard to the fact that the applicant was already subjected in addition to several other strict surveillance measures, that the authorities did not rely on any concrete convincing security needs and that, despite the serious charges against him, he apparently did not display any disruptive, violent or otherwise dangerous behaviour in prison, the Court considers that the practice of daily strip-searches applied to him for 7 years and some 9 months, combined with his nearly complete social isolation, must have diminished his human dignity and caused him feelings of inferiority, anguish and accumulated distress which went beyond the unavoidable suffering and humiliation involved in the imposition of detention on remand (see Van de Ven, cited above, § 62 and paragraph 86 above)."

Lastly, the Court would add that due to the strict, rigid rules for the imposition of the special regime and the vaguely defined “exceptional circumstances” justifying its discontinuation laid down in Article 212a § 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, the authorities, in extending that regime, were not in fact obliged to consider any changes in the applicant ’ s personal situation and, in particular, the combined effects of the continued application of the impugned measures (see paragraphs 44 and 93 above). Those rules – and this was also noted by the CPT – do not provide for adequate solutions enabling the authorities, if necessary, to adjust the regime to individual conduct or to reduce the negative impact of social isolation (see paragraphs 44-47 and 71-72 above).",
                "In the present case the authorities did not ever refer to any likelihood of the applicant ’ s escaping in the event of his being detained under a less strict regime. However, neither the apparent absence of such risk, nor the adverse emotional and mental effects of isolation as alleged by the applicant, were considered circumstances sufficient to justify lifting any of the strict measures applied under the regime (see paragraphs 24-29 above). In that context, the Court would again recall that, as stated above (see paragraph 92 above), in cases involving solitary confinement the authorities should act with special caution in imposing that measure and should examine carefully all the specific circumstances militating for or against its continuation.",

While those circumstances could justify the imposition of the “N” regime on the applicant for a certain, even relatively long, period (see paragraph 9 3 above ), they could not suffice as a sole justification for its prolonged continuation. As pointed out by the applicant (see paragraph 8 4 above ), with the passage of time the procedure for review of his “dangerous detainee” status became a pure formality limited to a repetition of the same grounds in each successive decision."

While during the period to be examined under Article 5 § 3 the charges against the applicant did not yet include organised crime (see paragraphs 6 and 9 above), the prosecution certainly faced a difficult task of obtaining and securing voluminous evidence from many sources and determining the respective roles played by each suspect. In the nature of things, in cases where, as in the present one, numerous persons are involved, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or accomplices or otherwise obstruct the proceedings must be considered a valid argument militating in favour of imposing detention, rather than other measures. This ground, even taken together with other reasons advanced by the authorities, might not by itself have been enough to justify a prolonged continuation of detention on remand.

In particular, in cases involving high-security prison regimes where the applicants are charged with, or convicted of, a serious offence representing a considerable social danger – for instance, violent or organised Mafia-type crime – the application of such measures as a physical separation of a detainee from his visitors through a special transparent partition can be justified by the prison security needs or the danger that a detainee would communicate with criminal organisations through the family channels (see, for instance, Van der Ven, cited above, §§ 16 and 54; and Messina no. 2, cited above, §§ 27 and 72). However, the extended prohibition on direct contact with family members is accepted under Article 8 only in so far as the authorities have not failed to fulfil their duty under this provision to enable, and assist, the applicant in maintaining contact with his close family and secured a fair balance between his rights and the aims of the special regime (see Messina no. 2, cited above, §§ 72-73 and paragraphs 12 3 -12 4 above)."

In the light of the material in the Court ’ s possession, it appears that neither this first visit, nor any further events or the applicant ’ s own behaviour during his detention (see paragraphs 84 and 10 1 - 10 2 above) revealed any grounds to believe that he intended to use his wife or daughters as intermediaries to restore contacts with the criminal community or that open family visits from them would jeopardise the prison security. Indeed, subsequently, open visits were granted to the applicant each year, although rarely, at different intervals and on an irregular basis (see paragraphs 33 ‑ 38 above ). In the Court ’ s view, this shows not merely the lack of a consistent pattern in the authorities ’ decisions but also, indirectly, that in reality the measures taken were not apparently related to any tangible fear or risk that could possibly legitimise the impugned restrictions under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (cf.

That duty is not discharged properly in situations where, as in the present case, the visits from children are organised in a manner exposing them to the view of prison cells and inmates and, as a result, to an inevitably traumatic, exceptionally stressful experience. The Court agrees that, as the applicant said, the exposure to prison life can be shocking even for an adult and, indeed, it must have caused inordinate distress and emotional suffering for his daughters (see paragraphs 39 and 119 above). It further notes that, owing to the authorities ’ failure to make adequate visiting arrangements, the applicant, having seen the deeply adverse effects on his daughters, had to desist from seeing them in prison. Throughout his detention from 14 July 2004 to the end of 2008 he saw his oldest daughter twice and each of the two younger ones once. In effect, he was deprived of any personal contact with them for several years (see paragraphs 33-34 and 37 above)."

Once placed under a lighter regime, a life prisoner could - by decision of the same commission on the basis of a personality assessment - be housed with the general prison population and allowed to take part in common work, training, educational activities, sport or other activities (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 121)."

Also, the automatic segregation of life prisoners from the rest of the prison population and from each other, in particular where no comprehensive out-of-cell activities or in-cell stimulus are available, may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Savičs, cited above, § 139), and the isolation should be justified by particular security reasons (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 204 with further references to soft-law instruments and the repeated emphasis in CPT reports on the need to assess life prisoners ’ dangerousness on a case-by-case basis there being no justification for indiscriminately applying restrictions to all prisoners subject to a specific type of sentence )."

This regime did not involve or allow meaningful activities and was considered lawful within the meaning of the domestic legislation (see paragraph 27 above). Furthermore, the limited possibilities for outdoor exercise and reasonable activities were confirmed by the domestic courts ’ findings in the applicant ’ s case at least for the period up to the year 2007 (see paragraph 26 above). The Court recalls in this connection that a short duration of outdoor exercise limited to one hour a day is a factor that further exacerbates the situation of a prisoner confined to his cell for the rest of the time (see, among other authorities, Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 208)."

Apart from that, and from the possibility for him to receive books and newspapers from the prison library in his cell, to play chess and take part in essay competitions in so far as the “special regime” of permanently locked cells permitted, the Government have not demonstrated that the relevant competent bodies ( namely the special commissions referred to in Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, §§ 116 and 121 ) considered the possibilities for involvement of the applicant in other reasonable activities with other prisoners. Indeed, the Court was not informed of any periodic assessment of the applicant ’ s situation by the special commission with a view to allowing him some meaningful activities."

It appears also that this situation is to a great extent a result of the automatic application of the legal provisions regulating the applicant ’ s prison regime. In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, §§ 203-09), the Court found that such automatic isolation, in application of the relevant provisions of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 and later of the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009, as well as the regulations for their application, was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

In addition, in terms of the material conditions of the applicant ’ s detention, the Court notes in particular the lack of unrestricted access to a toilet during a prolonged period of time and the fact that the applicant had no other choice but to relieve himself in a bucket in his cell outside the time-slots allowed by the prison administration for visits to the communal toilet. The Court notes that the Government accepted this to have been the case before the autumn of 2008 when they submitted the situation had changed in Lovech Prison, as toilets and sinks were built in the cells of prisoners serving life sentences (see paragraph 1 3 above). Notably, the Government argued that this circumstance was not debasing for the applicant, given that he was alone in his cell.

The latter were only allowed out of their cells to use the common toilet three times a day and had to relieve themselves in buckets the rest of the time. It notes that the applicant was transferred from Varna Prison to Lovech Prison on 19 February 2009 and that until that point in time he did not benefit from a cell equipped with a toilet and sink, and had to use a bucket. Even assuming that for certain periods of time the applicant was accommodated alone in a cell, the Court has already held that subjecting a detainee to the prolonged inconvenience of having to relieve himself or herself in a bucket cannot be deemed warranted, except in specific situations where allowing visits to the sanitary facilities would pose concrete and serious security risks (see Malechkov, cited above, § 140 ). In the present case the Government did not invoke any such risks to justify the need for the applicant to use a bucket to relieve himself during the period before 19 February 2009. In the absence of specific evidence to confirm or dispel the applicant ’ s dangerousness so as to justify the prolonged necessity of the his isolation under the “ special regime ” conditions of detention, the Court is unable to agree that the conditions, in which the applicant was held were compliant with Article 3 ( see Manolov, cited above, § 42 )."

In their decision of 8 May 2006 the court found that the applicant, like the other inmates serving life sentences under the “special regime”, had had to use a bucket in the cell for toilet needs. Life prisoners had only been let out of their cells three times a day when they were allowed to use the communal toilets and wash the buckets; during the rest of the time they had to relieve themselves in the cells in front of other inmates. The court concluded that the humiliation of having to use a bucket for one ’ s physiological needs could only be justified with security reasons. As the Government had failed to produce evidence that there had been a real and serious risk to security in the applicant ’ s case, the restrictions applied to his access to a toilet had been excessive and beyond the ones inherent to deprivation of liberty. The court awarded the applicant BGN 200 (approximately EUR 100) in damages suffered as a result of detention in inhuman and degrading material conditions – absence of toilet facilities, bed, linen, table and chair, access of light and fresh air caused by inaction of the respondent party in the period 26 October 2000 – 26 October 200 5.

However, he had access to the toilet during the day-time slots allowed for that and it had not been established that the prison guards had prevented him from visiting the toilet then. While serving such a punishment was no doubt characterized by negative and unfavourable effects, the circumstances of the case did not attract the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice and the prison authorities under the SMRDA since the enforcement of a punishment could not be considered as exercising administrative activities or as unlawful action or inaction within the meaning of Article 1 of this law.

It was notorious that the conditions in the Bulgarian prisons were not up to European standards, but these conditions were the same for all inmates. The execution of sentences was in itself accompanied by considerable restrictions associated with deprivation of liberty and the various regimes, especially by the “special regime” as compared to the others, and even more in placement in isolation cells as a disciplinary sanction for offences. In examining such complaints the courts had to take into account and strike the necessary balance between the prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment as set by the Constitution and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 3 of the Convention, and the inevitable suffering inherent to deprivation of liberty. The court acknowledged the degrading effect of using buckets in the presence of other prisoners, but also took into account the necessity to ensure security and discipline in accordance with the requirements of the “ special regime ” served in this department of the prison as well as the personalities and specific conduct of prisoners. In striking this balance in the particular case, the Supreme Court of Cassation found that the applicant ’ s suffering did not go beyond the level of due respect to his dignity and did not require any compensation.",

The applicant is serving his sentence under the ‘ special regime ’ in accordance with section 127b of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 [the 1969 Act]. Under section 127d in conjunction with section 127a of the 1969 Act the sentence of life imprisonment without commutation is implemented either in separate prisons or in special sections of the regular prisons.

Only after a decision of the commission under section 17 of the 1969 Act can those prisoners be accommodated in cells together with prisoners serving different sentences and can they take part in joint sport, work, educational or other activities. The lower court concluded on the basis of the legislation referred to above that the administration of Lovech and Varna Prisons cannot be said to have failed to act thus causing the applicant non-pecuniary damage. Admittedly, during the period in question the applicant did not take part in labour, educational or sport activities. However, that is explained with the type of regime under which he is serving his sentence and not with any unlawful conduct by the prison administration. The applicant has been involved in individual correctional activities; he had been allowed to spend an hour a day in the open air in a place furnished with sports equipment. As of February 2007, he has been allowed an additional hour for sport.

In order to engage the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice under section 1 of the SMRDA for the prison administration ’ s alleged failure to act, it is necessary to establish that the lack of action was unlawful, in other words, that there existed an obligation to act and the administration failed to do so. The prison regime is stipulated in the 1969 Act. According to sections 43 and 127a of the 1969 Act, as well as to section 167g of the regulations for its implementation, inmates placed under the “special regime” are mandatorily kept apart from the rest of the prison population. The evidence in the file does not show that the prison administration has acted in breach of the legislative framework regulating the enforcement of the punishment given to the applicant. Mr Hasan refers to Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to other relevant international instruments.

It appears also that this situation is to a great extent a result of the automatic application of the legal provisions regulating the applicant ’ s prison regime. In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, §§ 203-09), the Court found that such automatic isolation, in application of the relevant provisions of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 and later of the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009, as well as the regulations for their application, was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

In addition, in terms of the material conditions of the applicant ’ s detention, the Court notes in particular the lack of unrestricted access to a toilet during a prolonged period of time and the fact that the applicant had no other choice but to relieve himself in a bucket in his cell outside the time-slots allowed by the prison administration for visits to the communal toilet. The Court notes that the Government accepted this to have been the case before the autumn of 2008 when they submitted the situation had changed in Lovech Prison, as toilets and sinks were built in the cells of prisoners serving life sentences (see paragraph 1 3 above). Notably, the Government argued that this circumstance was not debasing for the applicant, given that he was alone in his cell. The Court observes, however, that the domestic courts ’ findings confirmed that during the period examined in the domestic proceedings the cells were inhabited also by other prisoners (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above)."

Furthermore, although the Government did not make submissions in respect of the conditions in Varna Prison, the CPT reports on its two visits to life prisoners in Varna Prison in 2010 and 2012 indicate, among other things, that no toilets were available in the cells of the life prisoners (see paragraph 3 5 above). The latter were only allowed out of their cells to use the common toilet three times a day and had to relieve themselves in buckets the rest of the time. It notes that the applicant was transferred from Varna Prison to Lovech Prison on 19 February 2009 and that until that point in time he did not benefit from a cell equipped with a toilet and sink, and had to use a bucket. Even assuming that for certain periods of time the applicant was accommodated alone in a cell, the Court has already held that subjecting a detainee to the prolonged inconvenience of having to relieve himself or herself in a bucket cannot be deemed warranted, except in specific situations where allowing visits to the sanitary facilities would pose concrete and serious security risks (see Malechkov, cited above, § 140 ). In the present case the Government did not invoke any such risks to justify the need for the applicant to use a bucket to relieve himself during the period before 19 February 2009. In the absence of specific evidence to confirm or dispel the applicant ’ s dangerousness so as to justify the prolonged necessity of the his isolation under the “ special regime ” conditions of detention, the Court is unable to agree that the conditions, in which the applicant was held were compliant with Article 3 ( see Manolov, cited above, § 42 )."

As in the cases mentioned above, the applicant is still incarcerated and it does not appear that, except with respect to the toilets or cell windows, the conditions of his detention – in particular, his very restrictive prison regime – have significantly changed in recent years (see paragraphs 1 0, 20, 2 6 and 2 7 above). A claim for damages under section 1 of the SMRDA is therefore, on its own, not capable of providing the applicant adequate relief. Moreover, such a claim, in so far as directed against conditions of incarceration that flow from the prison regime applicable to the applicant, does not stand high prospect of success, given that the Bulgarian courts have already dismissed such claims on the basis that such conditions were not unlawful within the meaning of the domestic law ( see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, § 226). Indeed, that is what happened in one of the cases brought by the applicant seeking damages for the conditions and regime in which he had been detained (see paragraphs 2 7 -2 8 above). Furthermore, it seems that the proceedings instituted by the applicant involved separate examination of the various aspects of his situation and for this reason failed to take into account whether their cumulative effect on him was compliant with Article 3 so as to afford redress where appropriate as required by Article 13 of the Convention."

Such a mechanism, therefore, could in principle represent an effective remedy in cases where individuals complain of discriminatory treatment and the applicant failed to resort to it in the context of his complaint about suffering racially demeaning insults. The Court then observes that the applicant used this remedy successfully on three occasions when he lodged discrimination claims complaining about other type of discriminatory treatment in prison (see paragraph 3 2 above). He obtained final judgments in his favour and did not claim that any of them had remained unenforced. The Court therefore finds premature a complaint about inefficient enforcement of a final judgment in relation to the alleged discriminatory remarks as the applicant has not obtained such a judgment."

It cannot be said that one case is representative of a general practice. The Court further notes that according to the 2006 Code, monetary judgment debts are collected on the basis of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007 under which a writ of enforcement is a condition for starting enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 42 above). It is not evident from the information in the file whether the individual asked the court to issue a writ in respect of the mayor ’ s obligation to discontinue the discriminatory treatment and, if so, what the court ’ s reply to that request was. In any event, the Court notes that forced enforcement can be started on the basis of a request by the individual to the bailiff, accompanied by a copy of the enforcement title which can be a final judgment in the individual ’ s favour (see paragraph 42 above). Therefore, a writ of enforcement is not an absolute condition for starting enforcement proceedings in administrative cases as regards obligations other than monetary payments."

                "71. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant was not informed at any stage officially and in writing of the reasons for his solitary confinement or of its expected duration. No formal record of the decision authorising the solitary confinement or any extension has been provided; indeed, the Government have not made any submissions regarding the manner in which the decision was made. The justification for the confinement provided for by the prison authorities following the Ombudsman ’ s investigation was that the applicant was placed in solitary confinement in order to ensure his own protection. However, the Court does not consider that this reason can justify the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement (see, mutatis mutandis, Lelièvre v. Belgium, no. 11287/03, § 104, 8 November 2007 ). Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s subsequent explanation of the reasons for the applicant being placed in solitary confinement – namely, for the preservation of discipline and order, the protection of the interests of the applicant himself and of other prisoners and discipline – given that this explanation was first advanced in their observations to the Court. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant was detained in solitary confinement for reasons which are unclear and which were never explained to him. The Court observes in this regard that a solitary confinement measure is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. Despite the gravity of the measure, there is no evidence that the authorities assessed all the relevant factors in the applicant ’ s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, § 83). It is also of significance that although instructions were given on 31 October 2003 to release the applicant from solitary confinement, the instructions were misplaced and as a consequence the applicant spent a further seven days in solitary confinement after his release had been ordered."

                "72. The Court recalls the recommendations contained in the report of the CPT following its visit to Cyprus in 2004. The CPT considered that any person placed in solitary confinement should be informed in writing of the reasons for his confinement. He should be given an opportunity to express his views and there should be a possibility to appeal to authorities outside the prison should he wish to challenge the decision to place him in solitary confinement or to extend the duration of such confinement. Further, the confinement should be re-examined at regular intervals and should cease when no longer merited. The European Prison Rules also refer to the need for clear procedures when applying solitary confinement measures."

                "73. It is clear that the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement was not attended by any of the procedural safeguards required in order to protect against the arbitrary application of excessively restrictive conditions of detention, regardless of the duration of the confinement. The Court refers to the CPT ’ s conclusion following the visit to Cyprus that there was a lacuna in the Prison Regulations as regards the guarantees to be afforded to those placed in solitary confinement. In the present case, the Court emphasises the lack of an adequate justification for the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement, the uncertainty concerning its duration, the failure to put in place a reliable system to record solitary confinement measures and to ensure that the applicant was not confined beyond the authorised period, the absence of any evidence that the authorities carried out an assessment of the relevant factors before ordering his confinement and the lack of any possibility to challenge the nature of his detention or its conditions."

As regards the physical conditions of the applicant ’ s detention, the Court takes note of the parties ’ different accounts and considers the prison logbook submitted by the respondent Government to be of particular assistance in clarifying both the physical conditions of the applicant ’ s confinement and the other restrictions applied during the 47-day period."

                "75. In the Court ’ s view, the prison logbook confirms the applicant ’ s account that he was subjected to a very restrictive regime of detention for 47 days. It is clear from the entries in the logbook that the applicant ’ s cell had neither sanitary facilities nor running water. Accordingly, the applicant was required to ask the prison guards to allow him to go to the toilet. The Court ’ s examination of the prison logbook shows that on a number of occasions the applicant only used the toilet once in the course of the day, which would appear to confirm his assertion that during certain periods of his detention he had to use water bottles and nylon bags for his needs. The Court considers that such a practice was humiliating (see Cenbauer, cited above, § 48)."

He also alleged that it was cold and damp. The Court observes that where there is a dispute between the parties as to the relevant facts, it will have regard to the parties ’ submissions and to any relevant findings of the CPT in order to assess the extent to which the applicant ’ s complaints are credible ( Cenbauer, cited above, § 45). In its report on Cyprus, the CPT did not comment on the physical conditions of cells in Nicosia Central Prison, except to say that material conditions in cells used for administrative separation or disciplinary purposes in block 8 were adequate. The Ombudsman, in her report on the applicant ’ s complaints, did not consider the physical conditions of the applicant ’ s detention. However, the Court notes that the applicant sustained an injury to his shoulder, which he alleges was a result of the cold and damp of the cell. The Government do not dispute the allegation. In the circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s injury would appear to support his contention that the cell was cold and damp."

                "77. As to whether the applicant was given appropriate medical care while in confinement, the Court observes that the prison logbook records two visits from the doctor. It further notes that the applicant refused to attend a scheduled appointment with the surgeon on 31 October 2003. The Court accordingly does not consider that the standard of care and attention showed to the applicant ’ s health by the prison authorities was deficient during the time spent in solitary confinement."
            ],
            [
                "78. However, the Court recalls that the CPT commented with concern on the significant duration of solitary confinement measures in Cyprus. It also criticised the lack of opportunity for detainees to leave their cells and to benefit from outdoor exercise, highlighting the applicant ’ s case which it concluded was unacceptable. It is clear from the prison logbook that the time spent by the applicant outside his cell was limited. Although, according to the prison logbook, he visited court on seven occasions, for the remainder of his solitary confinement he rarely left his cell. Most days, the cell was opened only for a brief period to allow him to use the shower or toilet or to collect his food. In this regard, the Court notes that in Cenbauer v. Croatia (cited above, § 49) it considered that the period of the applicant ’ s confinement to his cell, between 7p.m. and 7a.m. and for several hours during the day, was “substantial”. Furthermore, it is also clear from the prison logbook that human contact was mostly limited to the applicant ’ s dealings with prison staff and his visits to court. The CPT, in its report on Cyprus, condemned the absolute prohibition on contact with the outside world attendant on solitary confinement in Cyprus, insisting that restrictions on visits should be based only on security concerns of an appreciable nature or on the availability of resources."
            ],
            [
                "79. Finally, the Court has previously indicated that the obligation on prison authorities to ensure the health and well-being of detainees implied an obligation to provide appropriate nourishment ( Kadiķis (no. 2), cited above, § 55). It notes that, according to the prison logbook, the applicant was served food at irregular intervals, sometimes receiving only one full meal per day."

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the stringent custodial regime to which the applicant was subjected during his period in solitary confinement, including the prohibition on visits and the material conditions in which he was detained, caused him suffering clearly exceeding the unavoidable level inherent in detention. His exposure to these conditions for a period of 47 days amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention."

Indeed, the lack of an appropriate response by prison management can foster a climate in which those minded to ill-treat prisoners can quickly come to believe – and with very good reason – that they can do so with impunity.

In particular, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible. Further, they should be surrounded by certain guarantees. A prisoner in isolation or confinement or in respect of whom such a measure is extended, should be informed in writing of the reasons therefor (it being understood that there might be reasonable justification for withholding specific details related to security from the prisoner) and should be given an opportunity to express his views on the matter and have the right to appeal to an authority outside the prison establishment concerned against the imposition or extension of the measure.

In assessing whether a proposed remedy affords sufficient redress, the Convention provides for a distribution of the burden of proof and it is initially incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy relied upon was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. This requires that the proposed remedy be accessible, be capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offer reasonable prospects of success (see, among other authorities, Apostol, cited above, § 35; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 46, ECHR 2006-...; and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 76, ECHR 1999 ‑ V ).

As to the possibility of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution, the Court notes that in order for a recourse to be lodged with the Supreme Court, an individual must demonstrate that there was an administrative or executive decision, act or omission open to challenge. In the present case, it is not clear that the decision of the prison director to place the applicant in solitary confinement and restrict his visitation rights or the decision to monitor the applicant ’ s correspondence would constitute acts enabling the Supreme Court to exercise its revisional jurisdiction. In this regard, the Court observes that in the context of a separate application lodged with the Court (no. 42432/07 Andreas Onoufriou v. Cyprus ), the applicant provided details of an attempt to challenge a decision of the prison director to restrict his visitation rights. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that the relevant decision did not constitute an “administrative act” enabling the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Finally, the Court highlights that the Government have not referred to any decisions or judgments of the Supreme Court in which any decision of the nature in issue in the present case has been successfully challenged by way of an Article 146 recourse (see Apostol, cited above, § 38). In the circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that Article 146 of the Constitution offered an effective remedy for the applicant in respect of his present complaints."

The Court observes that the prison diary submitted by the respondent Government records meetings between the applicant and the Prisons Board on 1 and 5 November 2003. It further observes that the Government have not disputed that the applicant sought to make a complaint to the Prisons Board. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant did attempt to lodge his complaints with the Prisons Board but for reasons which are unexplained, the Prisons Board did not take any further action to investigate the complaints and report its findings to the applicant. In any event, in circumstances such as those arising in the present application, there is an obligation to conduct an ex officio investigation as soon as Article 3 is raised in substance (see Selmouni, cited above, §§ 79 to 80). To the extent that a complaint to the Prisons Board could be considered an effective remedy, the Court considers that the applicant has done what was required of him in order to exhaust that remedy."

They argued that there was no sensory isolation brought about by a substantial reduction in stimulation of the sensory organs.

Ensslin and Others v. Germany, no. 7572/76, Commission decision of 8 July 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 14, p. 91); (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 8158/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1980, DR 21, p. 95); Rohde v.

He maintained that he had been informed that the reason for his confinement was that he had violated his home leave, and he referred to the indictment served on him in November 2003, the first count of which consisted of an allegation of a violation of the conditions of his home leave.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the individual in question and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § 74, ECHR 2001-III; and Valašinas v.

Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 56, 17 September 2009 ). Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve an element of suffering or humiliation. However, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kudła v.

Further, when assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of those conditions, as well as the specific allegations made by the applicant ( Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-II). It is also relevant to recall that the authorities are under an obligation to protect the health of persons deprived of liberty (see Hurtado v.

Finally, in order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner ’ s welfare and the proportionality of the measure. First, solitary confinement measures should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Second, the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Third, the authorities ’ decisions should make it possible to establish that they have carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Finally, a system of regular monitoring of the prisoner ’ s physical and mental condition should also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement measures remain appropriate in the circumstances (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 1 39).",

No formal record of the decision authorising the solitary confinement or any extension has been provided; indeed, the Government have not made any submissions regarding the manner in which the decision was made. The justification for the confinement provided for by the prison authorities following the Ombudsman ’ s investigation was that the applicant was placed in solitary confinement in order to ensure his own protection. However, the Court does not consider that this reason can justify the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement (see, mutatis mutandis, Lelièvre v. Belgium, no. 11287/03, § 104, 8 November 2007 ). Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s subsequent explanation of the reasons for the applicant being placed in solitary confinement – namely, for the preservation of discipline and order, the protection of the interests of the applicant himself and of other prisoners and discipline – given that this explanation was first advanced in their observations to the Court. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant was detained in solitary confinement for reasons which are unclear and which were never explained to him. The Court observes in this regard that a solitary confinement measure is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. Despite the gravity of the measure, there is no evidence that the authorities assessed all the relevant factors in the applicant ’ s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, § 83). It is also of significance that although instructions were given on 31 October 2003 to release the applicant from solitary confinement, the instructions were misplaced and as a consequence the applicant spent a further seven days in solitary confinement after his release had been ordered."

He should be given an opportunity to express his views and there should be a possibility to appeal to authorities outside the prison should he wish to challenge the decision to place him in solitary confinement or to extend the duration of such confinement. Further, the confinement should be re-examined at regular intervals and should cease when no longer merited.

The Court refers to the CPT ’ s conclusion following the visit to Cyprus that there was a lacuna in the Prison Regulations as regards the guarantees to be afforded to those placed in solitary confinement. In the present case, the Court emphasises the lack of an adequate justification for the applicant ’ s detention in solitary confinement, the uncertainty concerning its duration, the failure to put in place a reliable system to record solitary confinement measures and to ensure that the applicant was not confined beyond the authorised period, the absence of any evidence that the authorities carried out an assessment of the relevant factors before ordering his confinement and the lack of any possibility to challenge the nature of his detention or its conditions."

Accordingly, the applicant was required to ask the prison guards to allow him to go to the toilet. The Court ’ s examination of the prison logbook shows that on a number of occasions the applicant only used the toilet once in the course of the day, which would appear to confirm his assertion that during certain periods of his detention he had to use water bottles and nylon bags for his needs.

In its report on Cyprus, the CPT did not comment on the physical conditions of cells in Nicosia Central Prison, except to say that material conditions in cells used for administrative separation or disciplinary purposes in block 8 were adequate.

It is clear from the prison logbook that the time spent by the applicant outside his cell was limited. Although, according to the prison logbook, he visited court on seven occasions, for the remainder of his solitary confinement he rarely left his cell. Most days, the cell was opened only for a brief period to allow him to use the shower or toilet or to collect his food. In this regard, the Court notes that in Cenbauer v. Croatia (cited above, § 49) it considered that the period of the applicant ’ s confinement to his cell, between 7p.m. and 7a.m. and for several hours during the day, was “substantial”. Furthermore, it is also clear from the prison logbook that human contact was mostly limited to the applicant ’ s dealings with prison staff and his visits to court.

The Court observes, and the Government do not dispute, that for 47 days, the applicant was subject to a particularly stringent prison regime which involved an absolute prohibition on visits from friends and family. In light of the restrictions imposed by his detention in solitary confinement and following examination of the relevant Prison Regulations, the Court further considers it unlikely that any request by the applicant for telephone communication with his family would have been granted. The Court concludes that there was an interference with the exercise of the applicant ’ s right to respect for his family life guaranteed by Article 8 § 1 of the Convention. Such interference can only be justified if it was in accordance with the law, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 2 of Article 8 and could be regarded as a measure which was “necessary in a democratic society”."

Finally, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § § 47 and 49, Series A no. 30 )."

The Court notes that this provision gives the prison director the power to “order the confinement or isolation of a prisoner for such period as he considers necessary”, for one of more of the purposes outlined in that regulation. The regulation provides no detail of what is meant by the phrase “confinement or isolation” or the degree of confinement or isolation envisaged. It makes no express reference to the curtailment of the general right granted by regulation 116 to visits from family and friends up to six times per month. It provides no guidance as to how a prison director might decide whether complete suspension of visitation rights is merited in a particular case, and what factors might be relevant to that decision. It is of significance in this respect that the applicant was given no formal notification that his visitation rights had been suspended, nor was he advised at the time of the reasons for the suspension.

In the applicant ’ s case, the letters were not stopped: they were subsequently forwarded to the Ombudsman and Attorney-General, the parties to whom they were addressed.

Although monitoring could, under the terms of regulation 115(7), result in the prohibition of the sending of particular letters, in the absence of further details from the applicant, there is no evidence that any letters written by him were stopped by the prison authorities.

No reference is made in Article 17 to the need for any interference to be necessary in a democratic society. The Court has previously considered the quality of the law to be deficient and thus found a violation of Article 8 § 1 where the domestic system provided for automatic screening of prisoners ’ correspondence, on the basis that such an approach did not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners could correspond and that the relevant provisions did not lay down any principles governing the exercise of the screening. In particular, they failed to specify the manner and the time-frame within which it should be effected. As screening was automatic, the authorities were not obliged to give a reasoned decision specifying grounds on which it had been effected (see, inter alia, Niedbała v.

First, in respect of the defined categories, the monitoring was automatic and there was no procedure for the applicant to challenge the application of the monitoring procedure to those categories of recipients.

In the present case, the prison authorities did not explain to the applicant at the time of the interference with his correspondence why these letters were sent for further inspection before being forwarded to their intended recipients. The applicant did not receive a reasoned decision specifying the grounds on which the referral had been made. Before this Court, the Government argued that the measure was intended to protect the rights of the applicant, the Ombudsman and other State authorities. They contended that the inspection and consequent delay was necessary in order to ensure that officials did not receive excessive number of letters from prisoners on subjects over which they had no competence, which were insulting or which were improper. However, the Court notes that the Government do not explain why it was considered that the applicant ’ s letters potentially fell within the categories outlined in regulation 115(7), such that their further inspection by the Ministry of Justice was thought necessary.

The Court further emphasises the Ombudsman ’ s role as a guardian of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the importance of respect for the confidentiality of correspondence of prisoners with the Ombudsman since it could – and in this case did – concern allegations against the prison authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 62, Series A no. 233 ).

Similar concerns were raised by the CPT concerning “removal from association” and placement in Division 5 which were part of the formal discipline and good order procedure of the facility.

At an unspecified time the prison officer brought the applicant a pair of crutches to assist him walking. According to the Government, disciplinary measures were taken against another inmate involved in the incident but not against the applicant, who had been transferred (from Division 2) to Division 6, a more secure division, immediately after the incident.

He stated that a plaster cast had been put around his leg and that he had been informed that he might need to undergo surgery if his eyesight was damaged as a result of the injury of his facial bone.

The psychologist referred the applicant to a psychiatrist, who eventually prescribed medication. However, the applicant had refused to take the medication and claimed that the psychiatrist had refused to help him.

At an unspecified time on the same day he was provided with a pair of crutches by the prison medical infirmary. On the same day he was also admitted to hospital and returned to cell 8 in Division 6 on 14 July 2013. The case summary drawn up on 14 July – before his discharge ‑ and submitted to the Court showed that all the medical investigations had been concluded and the results received prior to his discharge from hospital. According to the case summary the ankle x ‑ ray revealed a fracture and there was subluxation of the right foot; there was a head injury, specifically a fracture of the orbit and of the maxillary sinus; there were no signs of injury or fluid collection in the internal organs; an ophthalmic review had been carried out and the patient had been discharged from that department as well as from the orthopaedic ward where he had undergone tests and treatment for his bone injuries. The summary also showed that the applicant had to use crutches and to avoid bearing weight for the two weeks leading up to his outpatient appointment, after which he still would not be able to bear weight fully. It ordered a change of dressing to be undertaken within three days and prescribed appropriate medicines. Records also showed that a nurse had visited Division 6 to attend to the applicant on 15 July – the note in the register reads as follows: “Nurse C. and S. came to Division 6 at about 11.35 am to visit Fernando Soto in his cell”.

The applicant was initially placed in cell 8 (on the upper floor of Division 6), which was about six metres away from the guard room, thus making it possible to observe the applicant ’ s cell, which was to be left open. The Government submitted that, by order of a manager, on 21 July 2013 the applicant had been allowed to mingle with all other inmates without restriction. The applicant had then been transferred to cell 13 on a lower floor as soon as it was deemed safe for him, specifically on 26 July 2013. On 7 August 2013 he had been transferred to Division 5, which was also a secure division although it had fewer restrictions. The applicant was finally transferred to Division 3 on 22 October 2013.

Moreover, in April 2015 the applicant had been referred for psychiatric services by the psychologist. The Government submitted that although the applicant had a past history of being suicidal, there was no record that he had attempted suicide during the period he was detained in Division 6. The report prepared by the senior psychologist in prison (dated 27 April 2015) noted that the applicant attended his sessions regularly and was making progress. It noted that he felt guilty for not having made amends with his mother before her death (a few months earlier) and that he had deliberately provoked a fight. The report described the applicant as being “edgy and hyper-vigilant but not psychotic”, his sleep was not problematic, his appetite was normal and he was cooperative. He had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, but no other affective disorder was evident. He was put on medication for depression and further follow ‑ ups with the psychologist.

According to the Government, on 14 July 2013, prior to being discharged from hospital, the applicant had been seen by a physiotherapist and found fit for discharge. The applicant had also been given three appointments (between July and August 2013) with the ENT department of the hospital in connection with his facial injuries. On 20 July 2013, the applicant had been referred by the prison medical officer to the emergency department of the hospital because of a recurrent swelling of his right ankle.

It was also small and had three different bands of metal shutters, which hampered the entry of natural light. He claimed that his cell had lacked good ventilation – although there were two vents, one of them had been blocked. He alleged that the parts of the ceiling were falling apart and that white and yellow dust caused him to experience breathing problems, since he was an asthma sufferer.

                "Nevertheless, the remaining divisions provided generally poor living conditions for the inmates, and this was particularly the case in Divisions II, III and XIII. While most cells were sufficient for single occupancy (measuring some 9m²), the dormitory rooms at CCF (for example in Division XIII) were cramped, with nine inmates held in approximately 30m² (i.e. significantly less than the minimum standard of 4m² of living space per prisoner in a multiple-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT).",
                "Many of the cells were excessively hot (over 30 degrees Celsius at the time of the visit) with poorly functioning ventilation. Further, some of the cells were in a bad state of repair, with mould or ingrained dirt evident on the walls and around the windows. Many of the washrooms were dirty, some showers lacked shower ‑ heads and there were problems with drainage, which reportedly caused water to leak into the nearby cells (especially on the ground floor of Division XIII). The in - cell toilets were unscreened, had mal-functioning flushes, and the water was cut off intermittently.",
                "This was particularly problematic given an outbreak of diarrhoea among the prisoners during the delegation ’ s visit (...).",
                "Prisoners did not believe that in-cell water from the sinks was safe to drink and the staff concurred with them. Many prisoners, especially those inmates who only lived off the basic €27 monthly allowance, complained to the delegation about the lack of ready access to safe drinking water and the need to buy bottled water.",

They were not equipped with any means of rest (let alone any sports or recreational equipment) or any shelter to protect prisoners from sun or rain. The yards were extremely hot, and at the time of the visit, the delegation noted that not a single prisoner made use of them during the day.",

At the time of the visit, the activities on offer included access to the gym and football ground, educational courses on music, information technology and languages, technical courses on stone masonry and carpentry and lifeskills programmes including on positive parenting and first aid. Work was also on offer to prisoners, mainly in the form of toy doll construction. The CPT ’ s delegation welcomed the fact that more than 80% of all the inmates had access to some kind of work or education; the situation in this respect had improved since the 2011 visit.",

                "In respect of health-care staffing at CCF, there were three General Practitioners (GPs) on contract with the prison, who provided a clinic onsite from Mondays to Fridays, from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. Two of these GPs also provided on-call services overnight and at weekends. Five or six nurses were on duty every day, from 7 a.m. to 8.30 p.m., and one nurse attended to the administration of methadone between 7 a.m. and midday every day, including weekends. A psychiatric clinic was held on Mondays and Fridays with the services of two consultant psychiatrists, who were supported by a staff-grade psychiatrist. Now, inmate patients wishing to see the psychiatrist had to be first referred by the GP. A dentist visited CCF every Tuesday and Wednesday (and a dental hygienist visited on Thursdays) and examined 12 to 15 patients every week. There was also a pharmacist, who attended CCF from Mondays to Fridays between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.",
                "67. The CPT ’ s delegation had some serious concerns about the co-ordination of health-care services and the guarantee of medical confidentiality at CCF. At the time of the visit, two experienced (and committed) prison officers were responsible for co ‑ ordinating the activities of the health-care service. They were also responsible for ensuring the security as part of their ordinary role as prison officers and the administration of hospital appointments. In the delegation ’ s view, the management was over-relying on prison officers to co-ordinate and manage health-care services at CCF. Further, these officers had ready access to the medical records and indeed were responsible for the filing of correspondence. In this respect, medical confidentiality was not guaranteed.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities take steps to:",
                "ensure that medical confidentiality is strictly guaranteed and that prison officers do not have access to medical records; and",
                "review the co-ordination of health-care by prison officers at CCF and, in this respect, it invites the authorities to consider the possibility of recruiting a fulltime health-care staff member to oversee co-ordination and management of the health ‑ care services provided at CCF.",
                "68. The delegation was also concerned about the management of medicines and the procedure and manner in which medicines were distributed to inmates at CCF. Staff interviewed by the delegation also raised several concerns in this respect.",
                "For instance, psychiatric medicines were mixed together and dissolved in a cup of water, every morning, and issued to inmates either once, twice or three times later that same day. Such an arrangement takes no account of the pharmaco ‑ kinetics of the individual drug, its bioavailability or any potential interactions with other psychiatric drugs. The pharmacist explained that sometimes such a mixture might be green in colour and at other times the same drugs are pink in colour. This concern was also raised by some inmates in subsequent interviews with the delegation.",
                "69. The delegation also observed that medicines were removed by nursing staff from their original packets and put into open containers, whose labels did not include any expiry date. The containers were simply topped up by the nursing staff as stocks dwindled, with the result that the expiry dates of individual tablets within these containers were not known at the time that they were administered. If a particular stock ran low, then it was likely that tablets taken from the bottom of the container would have passed their expiry date. Moreover, in making up the medicines for inmates, the nursing staff took a number of pills from the open containers and placed them in a tub which had the inmate ’ s name on the lid only. In essence, this meant that if the wrong lid was put on the wrong tub, an inmate would get the incorrect medication.",
                "70. (...) In addition, while prescriptions were annotated by doctors, there was often no review date of prescriptions with the result that it was unclear, in many cases, how long the medicines should be continued to be administered. Overall, the current administration of medication at CCF, and particularly the administration of psychotropic medication, was unsafe.",
                "The CPT recommends that the authorities review the current practices around the management of medicines at CCF in light of the above remarks, and ensure that unsafe practices around the administration of psychotropic medication cease.",
                "71. By letter dated 4 November 2015, the Maltese authorities informed the Committee that a review of the health-care system at CCF was being undertaken, in order to terminate the current contractual system. The employment of full-time medical staff was also under consideration. The CPT welcomes the review and would like to receive a copy of the review report and recommendations.",
                "b. self-harm and suicide prevention",
                "72. The delegation observed that there was no strategy in place regarding the management of those thought to be at risk of self-harm. For instance, there were no clear guidelines available to health-care staff on how to address incidences of food refusal.",
                "73. The CPT ’ s delegation noted that cases of self-harm and attempted suicide were not systematically recorded at CCF and there was no specific self-harm or trauma register. One of the reasons for this, according to staff interviewed, was that ordinarily at-risk prisoners were transferred from CCF to the Forensic Unit at Mount Carmel Hospital, where they usually remained for a few days. While the fact of the transfer was recorded, only in very few of these cases was any reference made to the risk of self-harm/ suicide attempts. It was more common to simply find the word “confused” written in the records. Moreover, there were no hand-over or follow-up procedures concerning those prisoners who returned to CCF from the psychiatric forensic units in Mount Carmel Hospital. Thus, appropriate handover and follow-up procedures should be established at CCF for returning prisoners from the psychiatric forensic units at Mount Carmel.",
                "74. As regards suicide prevention policies, it is clear that CCF needs to put in place procedures for the identification of prisoners who may be at risk of suicide or self ‑ harm and draw up a protocol for the management of prisoners identified as presenting a risk. To begin with, medical screening on arrival, and the reception process as a whole, has an important role to play in suicide prevention; performed properly, it should assist in identifying those at risk and relieve some of the anxiety experienced by all newly-arrived prisoners. The screening process should include a suicide risk assessment using an identified screening tool.",
                "Moreover, it is essential that the prevention of suicide, including the identification of those at risk, should not rest with the health-care service alone. All prison staff coming into contact with inmates – and, as a priority, staff who work in the reception and admissions units – should be trained in recognising indications of suicidal risk. The sharing of information concerning suicidal tendencies with prison staff can be considered as an ethical necessity in light of the possible consequences that inaction may entail. In this connection, it should be noted that the periods immediately following admission to prison as well as before and after trial and, in some cases, the pre-release period, are associated with an increased risk of suicide.",
                "Upon identification of prisoners potentially at risk, steps should be taken to ensure a proper flow of information within the establishment. All persons identified as presenting a suicide risk should as a first step benefit from appropriate support and association. Further, if required, such persons should be subject to special precautions (placement in a ligature-free room and provision of suicide-proof clothing) and, where there is a high risk of suicide, the prisoner should be under constant observation by a member of staff who should engage in a dialogue with the prisoner. The need for enhanced contacts (i.e. family visits and telephone calls) should be individually assessed.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Maltese authorities ensure that a comprehensive suicide prevention and management approach is introduced at CCF, taking into account the above remarks.",
                "b. disciplinary procedures, segregation and solitary confinement",
                "80. It is in the interests of both inmates and prison staff that clear disciplinary procedures be both formally established and applied in practice; any grey zones in this area involve the risk of unofficial (and uncontrolled) systems developing. Disciplinary procedures should provide prisoners with a right to be heard on the subject of the offences that they allegedly had committed, and to appeal to a higher authority against any sanctions imposed.",
                "Further, if other procedures exist ‑ alongside the formal disciplinary procedure ‑ under which an inmate may be involuntarily separated from other inmates for discipline-related/security reasons (e.g. in the interests of good order within an establishment), these procedures should also be accompanied by effective safeguards.",
                "81. As regards the disciplinary procedures at CCF, according to the law an inmate found guilty of a disciplinary offence may undergo the following punishments: caution; forfeiture or postponement for any period of any of the privileges; exclusion from associated work for a period not exceeding fifty-six days; cellular confinement not exceeding thirty days; or forfeiture of not more than one hundred and twenty days of remission.",
                "87. The CPT ’ s delegation noted that ‘ problematic ‘ prisoners placed on Divisions V and XIII were subjected to a particularly restrictive regime compared with other prisoners. On both divisions, the inmates had little to do and were locked in the divisions for long periods of the day, save for a couple of hours when they were allowed to exercise in the divisions ’ exercise yards. The vast majority of these inmates (including all those on Division XIII) had no access to education, activities, work or regular religious worship; all those interviewed by the delegation complained about the lack of any purposeful activities. Moreover, on Division V, some inmates had even resorted to hunger strikes in order to be allowed to attend the prison church. The restrictive regimes on Divisions V and XIII applied to all inmates, regardless of their classification, and included some life-sentenced prisoners.",
                "By letter dated 4 November 2015, the Maltese authorities informed the Committee that a limited education service would be introduced on Division V and that work opportunities in maintenance would be offered to a greater number of inmates on Division V. The CPT welcomes these initiatives. It would like to receive confirmation from the authorities when these measures have been introduced.",

In contrast, the placement procedure and the safeguards surrounding placement on Division XIII, which resulted in a restrictive regime for the inmate concerned, were opaque and little understood by the inmates. Inmates did not know why they had been placed on such a division, or for how long they would be accommodated there. Inmates were also unaware of any avenues to appeal or challenge the placement decision. Moreover, some inmates were placed there immediately upon arrival due to the lack of a formal induction procedure or area at CCF as well as due to the lack of other available accommodation on any other division. In the delegation ’ s view, placement on Division XIII was treated by the staff as an informal punishment, and was perceived as such by the inmates.",

Cells were in a very poor state of repair and had only very limited access to natural light. Another major problem was the high level of humidity in many cells, caused by water leaking from the ceiling. In this regard, cell no. 51 in Division 2 (which also had no window) and cell no. 114 in Division 3 were particularly affected. The latter cell was extremely dilapidated and so humid (with water running down the walls) that the prisoner could not keep any personal belongings in his cell. Moreover, in many cells, the toilet flush was not functioning, and, in particular in Division 3, most of the shower facilities (including the sinks) were broken.",

In the light of those facts the Court found that those three applicants did not intend to pursue their applications. Also bearing in mind that their complaints were identical to the ones brought by the other ninety ‑ nine applicants, the Court considered that there were no special circumstances regarding respect for human rights as defined in the Convention or its Protocols which required the continuation of the examination of the application in respect of those three applicants, and proceeded to strike out their applications (ibid, §§ 40 ‑ 45)."

The Court ’ s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant ’ s detention may be summarised in the following manner: the period of an applicant ’ s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. The applicant ’ s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation” (see Ananyev and Others v.

It can therefore be said that – unlike Division 3, which is a regular division – Divisions 5 and 6 are both high ‑ security divisions in the same establishment, and can thus be considered as being the “same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions” and the situation can therefore be regarded as a “continuing” one. It follows that, given that the applicant lodged his application on 1 April 2014, the complaint – in so far as it concerns the period of detention in Divisions 5 and 6, which came to an end on 22 October 2013 – is in conformity with the application of the six-month rule, as is the period subsequently spent in Division 3."

In ‑ house doctors give their services to inmates on a daily basis. The prison also engages the services of a psychiatrist and a psychologist in order to examine inmates who need such medical assistance. The applicant had been regularly medically examined and even referred to the State hospital when necessary. It was established procedure for inmates to be examined by nurses immediately after an injury. Subsequently they would be examined by the prison doctor. In the applicant ’ s case, medical treatment had been provided after his injury. As regards the subsequent treatment, the Government pointed out that the appointment of 12 June 2015 was the only one which had been cancelled, as otherwise he had attended all the appointments that had been scheduled. They rebutted the applicant ’ s argument by submitting the full records instead of redacted ones concerning the nurse ’ s visit, and in relation to the cancelled appointment they relied on further documentation, namely a note which read “Refused by Inmate. Informed by CO148”, as well as an undated declaration by CO148 reaffirming this. They also referred to the report by the psychiatrist (see paragraph 17 above). In the light of the above the Government considered that the applicant had been given all the necessary medical treatment in a prompt manner.

Given the similarity of the complaints, as well as the submissions and documentary evidence provided by the parties, the Court refers to its general findings in that case concerning each of the issues mentioned, and reiterates its concerns (particularly at §§ 115-117, and 120-121) most of which are reiterated by the most recent CPT report (see paragraph 27 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that one of the pictures submitted by the Government to prove the availability of running water in cell 8, in fact does not show any running water. Nevertheless, the Court is prepared to accept that this is the result of an error, or in any event represented a temporary interruption which did not persist in the long run. The most recent CPT report (see paragraph 27 above) confirmed that running water was cut off intermittently. However, the applicant ’ s complaint did not focus on the lack of running water but rather on the quality of the water per se and the fact that it was not cold.

The Court notes that the photographs submitted by the Government concerning the cell at issue only show its state after repair work had been carried out by the current detainee – which goes to show that the cell needed restoration, but reiterates that it does not find it demeaning for the detainees to be encouraged to paint their cells, with paint provided by the authorities (ibid, § 125).

The Court notes that sometime after the applicant left Division 6, and prior to the CPT visit in 2015, Division 6 was indeed closed down. In their 2011 report (see paragraph 28 above) the CPT, which described the situation in Division 6 as appalling, had commented that the artificial lighting was poor. However, no mention was made of a total lack of electricity. That being so, and given the contrasting versions of the parties, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant ’ s claim in this respect is substantiated."

Lastly, as it did in Story and Others, in examining the cumulative effect of the factors complained of, the Court cannot but take account of the fact that cells were unlocked at 7.30 a.m. and left open until 12.30 p.m.; they were unlocked again at 2 p.m. and locked at 8.30 p.m. As to the time spent in Division 5 and 6, details concerning the matter have not been submitted by the parties but the Court notes that even in Division 6 ‑ the highest security division – the applicant ’ s cell was left open for seven hours a day, and according to the CPT report, in Division 5 (at the time of the visit Division 6 had been closed down) where prisoners were subjected to a particularly restrictive regime, they were nonetheless allowed a couple of hours a day in the exercise yard (see paragraph 27 above). The applicant was therefore free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for several hours a day, depending on the Division. Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicant ’ s conditions of detention. To that must be added the fact that, even when in the cell, the applicant was not exposed to extreme conditions, since in the relevant period he was always held in a cell measuring around 9 sq.m, with an individual sleeping place and the usual items of equipment."

Denmark, no. 69332/01, § 93, 21 July 2005). In that connection the length of the period in question requires careful examination by the Court as to its justification, the need for the measures taken and their proportionality with regard to other possible restrictions, the guarantees offered to the applicant to avoid arbitrariness and the measures taken by the authorities to satisfy themselves that the applicant ’ s physical and psychological condition allowed him to remain in isolation (see Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], no. 59450/00, § 136, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX )."

                "76. However, the Court notes that the situation does not appear to have been one of solitary confinement imposed as a sanction resulting from a disciplinary measure. The Government submitted that the decision to house the applicant in Division 6 had been for security purposes, presumably as a result of concerns following the incident of 12 July 2013. Nevertheless, the Court takes issue with the way in which this decision was taken, particularly the fact that the decision and the details pertaining to it were not made known to the applicant. The result was that he could not have taken any action in this respect, such as an appeal, even if this had been at all available. The Court notes that the CPT also raised concerns regarding such procedures whereby detainees are involuntarily separated from other inmates for security or disciplinary reasons (alongside the formal disciplinary procedures) and called for effective safeguards. Similar concerns were raised by the CPT concerning “removal from association” and placement in Division 5 which were part of the formal discipline and good order procedure of the facility. Furthermore, in their previous report of 2011, also referred to in 2016 (see paragraph 27 above), they had raised “concerns about the existence of an informal punishment system in the so ‑ called ‘ high ‑ security unit ’ of Division 6”."

Quite apart from the above concerns, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s detention in Division 6 was for no longer than two weeks, and his only restriction on speaking to other inmates applied in relation to his aggressor. While he claimed to have been unable to use the communal areas, the Government made no specific submission on this point and it is unclear whether this also formed part of the unpublished decision. No further details have been submitted by the applicant concerning other restrictions applicable in Division 6 and no detail whatsoever has been submitted concerning restrictions in Division 5, where the applicant spent nearly three months. It follows that, while similar situations ‑ specifically decisions on punishment or security measures ‑ certainly call for an appropriate framework, which would also dispel any discrimination concerns, in the light of the Court ’ s case-law referred to in paragraph 75 above, from the material available to it the Court cannot find that the situation the applicant endured during that period raises issues within the ambit of Article 3."

Part of the appropriateness of the treatment is also its promptness (see Paladi v. Moldova, no. 39806/05, § 81, 10 July 2007 upheld by the Grand Chamber in Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no. 39806/05, § 72, 10 March 2009). Leaving a detained person without essential medical treatment as prescribed by medical experts over a substantial period of time and without satisfactory explanation amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Mikhaniv v.

The reasons that were advanced for the delay, such as the applicant ’ s allegedly intoxicated state or the radiographer ’ s absence on holiday, were found to be wholly unacceptable since the applicant was in the custody of the respondent State and it owed him a duty of care. In that case, although the Court accepted that the applicant must have suffered some pain, it could not speculate on its intensity and he had subsequently received adequate treatment for his injury, including an operation in a specialist hospital, regular check-ups and physiotherapy. Moreover, he had not submitted any evidence as to whether the continuing problems with his ankle were the consequence of the belated treatment or the injury itself. The Court thus considered that the one-day delay in treating his injury did not reach the necessary minimum level of severity to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. As in Răducu v.

The Court observes that his head injury could have given rise to medical problems more serious than those which actually resulted and thus could have led to irreparable consequences for the applicant for which the State would have been responsible (compare Anguelova, cited above).

For the Court, the issue is not whether the applicants concluded or could have concluded from various clues that extraditions proceedings were pending against them, or whether Mr Saydayev ought to have shown zeal in the context of a favour which he was providing unofficially to a State employee. The issue is whether that employee himself, instructed by his hierarchical superiors to perform a specific task, properly informed the applicants of the fact that they were being held on account of a request for extradition to Russia. The Court has not overlooked the fact that it was impossible for Mr Darbaydze to assess the accuracy of the impugned interpretation into Chechen; however, in the light of the responsible task entrusted to him and the serious objections that the question of extradition could have provoked among the applicants, it was incumbent on him to phrase his interpretation request with meticulousness and precision.

Their lawyers pointed out that the extradition request had not been drawn up using their clients'real names and that it included photographs of them taken by the Georgian authorities during their detention in Tbilisi Prison no. 5. They complained that the detention orders in respect of their clients, issued on 16 August 2002 by the Staropromislovsk Court of First Instance (Grozny) (see paragraph 64 above), contained no reference to a maximum length of detention and that the applicants'defence rights had been totally breached in the proceedings which had resulted in those orders. In view of these shortcomings, they sought a refusal of the impugned extradition request. Further, basing their argument on Russia's failure to ratify Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, they concluded that the Russian assurances were scarcely sufficient for the purposes of the European Convention on Extradition. They considered that, in order to be satisfactory, these assurances ought to have come from the President of the Russian Federation."

The Acting Minister for Refugees stated before the court that that status had been granted under the Refugee Act (see paragraph 257 below). Having established that Mr Baymurzayev had never been deprived of his refugee status in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, the court concluded that it was impossible to extradite him to Russia. With regard to Mr Gelogayev, the court noted that, by a decision of 25 November 2002, the Ministry for Refugees had withdrawn his refugee status, on the basis of a letter from the Ministry of the Interior dated 20 November 2002 and a report from the Committee on Refugee Status."

It ordered that Mr Gelogayev's extradition be suspended pending completion of the administrative proceedings instigated by him against the decision of 25 November 2002 to withdraw his refugee status. As to Mr Khashiev, the Supreme Court noted that his photograph, taken by the Georgian authorities, had been sent to the Russian authorities for the purpose of identifying him, but that this had been unsuccessful. Furthermore, the defence submitted a copy of a Russian passport indicating that Mr Khashiev was not in fact named either Khashiev or Elikhadjiev, but Mulkoyev (see paragraphs 83 above and 101 below). At the request of the Georgian Procurator-General's Office, the Russian authorities had apparently checked the authenticity of this copy and had replied on 6 May 2003 that such a passport had never been issued. Given those circumstances, the Supreme Court considered that Mr Khashiev's identity had not been established and decided to suspend his extradition; it sent this part of the case back to the Procurator- General's Office for further investigation.",

The Regional Court found that they had been forced to commit the offence because they had no other option and that “they had naturally considered that what was transgressed [national security, the border, etc.] was less important than what was preserved, namely their own lives”. It was noted that the investigating authorities had not questioned the border guards involved and had prosecuted the two applicants solely on the basis of their own statements. The Regional Court had examined the border guards, who had stated that, at the point where the applicants had crossed into Georgia, the border was not marked, even by a flag, and that as such it was unidentifiable and delimited in an approximate manner by the two States concerned.

He had met Mr Khadjiev and Mr Aziev, who were also escaping from Russian shelling, in the forest. All three had sought refuge in the cabin of a Georgian shepherd named Levan. Another group of Chechens had also taken shelter there. Having learned from the shepherd that they were already in Georgian territory, the escapees had sent their host to request help from the Georgian border guards.

No names having been given, they were unaware of who exactly would be affected by that operation. They had received no prior information or official notification on this matter. The applicants understood that the information gleaned from the television was accurate when, between 3 and 4 a.m., prison wardens arrived and asked them to leave the cell so that it could be disinfected (or searched, according to Mr Kushtanashvili ). The applicants categorically refused to comply, with the result that the prison governor named four individuals and asked them to leave the cell. In response, the applicants asked that nothing be done until daybreak and that their lawyers be summoned; this request was refused. About fifteen hooded members from the Georgian Ministry of Justice's special forces then entered the cell and removed the applicants one by one. They used truncheons and applied electric shocks. The applicants were beaten as they lay on the floor in the corridor. The four applicants affected by the extradition order were immediately removed and the others were placed in solitary confinement.

Confirming the facts set out in paragraphs 62-64, 67-69 and 71-72 above, Mr Mskhiladze emphasised that the Georgian authorities had asked their Russian counterparts for firm assurances concerning the treatment that would await the applicants in the event of extradition. He pointed out that those had not been general assurances, but individual guarantees in respect of each applicant, cited by name in the relevant letters. Given that the assurances had come from the Russian Procurator - General's Office and that the Office had the role of prosecutor during criminal trials in Russia, the Georgian authorities had every reason to believe that the death penalty would not be sought in respect of the applicants. They had also taken into account that a moratorium on the death penalty had been in force in Russia since 1996 and that the imposition of such a sanction had been prohibited by the Constitutional Court's judgment of 2 February 1999. Beset by “certain doubts ”, the Georgian authorities had required the same type of assurance with regard to inhuman or degrading treatment.

The Russian authorities had indeed submitted the photographs of the applicants which were included with the copies of Form no. 1 (see the footnote on page 12 above). According to Mr Mskhiladze, this was explained by the fact that, at the request of the Ministry of Security's investigation team responsible for examining the illegal border crossing, the Procurator-General's Office had submitted a request for assistance in that criminal case to the Russian authorities, in accordance with the Minsk Convention. The request, accompanied by the applicants'photographs and fingerprints, was intended to identify the persons concerned and had been drawn up at the end of August 2002. Given that the extradition request, supported by photographs of the applicants and other documents, had been submitted on 6 August 2002, Mr Mskhiladze did not believe that the two sets of photographs could be the same."

In addition, according to the Georgian Ministry of Justice, those individuals did not possess, and had never possessed, Georgian nationality. The Ministry for Refugees had also indicated that they were not on the refugee list. Thus, the extradition orders of 2 October 2002 had not resulted from a hasty procedure.

On 8 January 2004 the Russian Government alleged that Mr Khadjiev's submission of a complaint to the Court (see paragraph 235 above) marked a turning point in the instant case and was a breakthrough in the procedural impasse. They had no doubt that Mr Khadjiev had indeed applied to the Court on this occasion and claimed that there was consequently no further point in considering the alleged communications which had previously been sent by him to the Court or those sent on behalf of the four other extradited individuals. The Russian Government stated that they recognised the authority to act given by Mr Khadjiev to Mr Kotov in his application against Georgia. They requested that this application be subject to the “ordinary procedure” and be communicated to them, and that all of the previous proceedings in the instant case be annulled. In their opinion, this would put an end to “non-procedural activities in this case”. On 5 and 13 February 2004 the Court reminded the Government that Mr Khadjiev's complaints had been communicated to the respondent Governments prior to consideration of their admissibility and that they did not require any fresh communication measure."

Other prisoners have disappeared without trace. Thus, an entire people was allegedly exposed to a serious threat of extermination. In addition to those observations, the reports contain about sixty interviews with Chechens who had been held in about a dozen “detention centres” across Chechnya and the neighbouring Caucasus regions and had survived torture, rape and ill-treatment. They had been released as a result of bribes paid to Russian soldiers. The reports describe different forms of torture carried out in those centres. The report “Welcome to Hell” presents evidence of the acts of torture and ill-treatment experienced by Chechen prisoners in pre-trial detention centres in the Stavropol region. The methods regularly used in those premises include the “ live corridor” (the prisoners are beaten as they go through a corridor), the “beating of kneeling and bent-over prisoners ” and “beating of naked prisoners with clubs, carried out in shower rooms ”. All the Chechen former prisoners who gave evidence to Human Rights Watch used false names and were described using pseudonyms, which were cited in quotation marks."

At the same time, many applicants have been threatened, harassed, detained, or even forcibly disappeared and killed. Some of the cases, notably that of Lipkhan Bazaeva who is both an activist and an applicant, have already been mentioned. There was a sharp rise in cases of persecution of applicants in 2003 and 2004. This pattern can be explained partly by the fact that there is a growing number of applicants. But even when this is taken into account, the number of attacks appears to have grown disproportionately to the number of applicants – a fact which suggests that persecution of applicants is an emerging trend.",

In two cases soldiers illegally searched an applicant's house. At least one of the applicants was robbed. In four cases, applicants were beaten. In one case, the applicant went into hiding. In at least two cases the applicants are considering withdrawing their applications to the courts. Two formally withdrew their applications. Most of the threats and beatings were reported in 2003 and 2004. Federal forces are believed to be involved in all of these cases. The organisations representing the applicants claim that notifications about incidents from the ECtHR to the Russian authorities have had a positive effect in some cases, easing the pressure on individual applicants and their families.",

In their final submissions of 20 July 2004 (see paragraph 50 above), the Russian Government argued that it was procedurally impossible for the Court to adopt a judgment in the present case. They gave the following reasons. Firstly, the criminal case against Mr Shamayev, Mr Khadjiev, Mr Adayev and Mr Vissitov was still pending before the domestic courts (see paragraph 108 above) and the court to which the case had been remitted should correct the violations found by the Court of Cassation before the Court ruled on the application. Secondly, given that their signatures had been forged by Ms Mukhashavria and Ms Dzamukashvili, the above-named applicants had never applied to the Court (see paragraph 230 above). In addition, the Court had disregarded Mr Khadjiev's rights by failing to “officially communicate” his case, as submitted by Mr Kotov, to the respondent Governments (see paragraph 235 above). Since the lawyer of Mr Khadjiev's choice had accordingly not been permitted to take part in the proceedings, even though he had not resorted to forgery, the Court had no procedural basis for ruling on the merits of the disputed matters."

In particular, it found that the present application concerned real, specific and identifiable individuals and that their complaints, relating to alleged violations of the rights guaranteed to them under the Convention, were based on actual events, including some that were not contested by either of the two respondent Governments. The Court does not perceive any “special circumstance” at this stage which would entail a fresh examination of the arguments that the present case was abstract in nature and amounted to an abuse of process ( see Stankov and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

Without indicating the relevant domestic-law provision which, they claim, prohibited anyone apart from the convicted person in question from receiving copies of a judgment, the Government have transferred the responsibility for this “impossibility to cooperate ” to the Council of Europe (see paragraph 108 above). Whatever the legal provision in question (see, for example, Article 312 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – paragraph 264 above), the Court does not accept the Russian Government's argument and points out that it is for each Contracting Party to submit to the Court, through its representative, any relevant domestic document."

Admittedly, the extradited applicants'situation may enable the reliability of the assurances provided by the Russian authorities to their Georgian counterparts to be assessed (see paragraph 20 above), but the alleged incompletion of the criminal proceedings brought against them in Russia is not, in this case, such as to prevent the Court from ruling on the complaints against Russia (see paragraphs 480 et seq. below).

Mr Gabaydze, who appeared on television, had merely dismissed, without conviction, the possibility that Georgian citizens would be extradited. As Russian nationals, the applicants who were subsequently extradited therefore had no reason to believe that the measure did not concern them (see paragraphs 124, 215 and 216 above)."

The lawyers considered that, having regard to the findings of Human Rights Watch, set out in the document “Welcome to Hell” (see paragraph 268 above), the extradited applicants'total isolation in “a SIZO in the Stavropol region” raised serious doubts concerning the treatment that awaited them in that establishment."

Most of the applicants are aged between twenty-two and thirty-one. Capital punishment has not been abolished in Russia, but the Russian courts would appear to be abstaining from its use at present. The Court observes that Protocol No. 13 to the Convention has not been signed by Russia and that Protocol No. 6, signed on 16 April 1996, has still not been ratified by that State. In so far as it is able to ascertain from information in its possession (see paragraph 107 above), the Court notes that Mr Shamayev, Mr Adayev, Mr Khadjiev and Mr Vissitov, four of the extradited applicants, were not sentenced to the death penalty by the first-instance court. This is also true in respect of Mr Khashiev (Elikhadjiev, Mulkoyev ) and Mr Baymurzayev (Alkhanov), who were sentenced on 14 September and 11 October 2004 to thirteen and twelve years'imprisonment by the Chechen Supreme Court (see paragraph 106 above)."

A Contracting State which has not ratified Protocol No. 6 and has not acceded to Protocol No. 13 is authorised to apply the death penalty under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 2 § 2 of the Convention. In such cases, the Court seeks to ascertain whether the death penalty itself amounts to ill-treatment as prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. It has already established that Article 3 cannot be interpreted as generally prohibiting the death penalty ( see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 40-41, § § 103-04 ), since that would nullify the clear wording of Article 2 § 1. That does not, however, mean that circumstances relating to a death sentence can never give rise to an issue under Article 3. The manner in which it is imposed or executed, the personal circumstances of the condemned person and a disproportionality to the gravity of the crime committed, as well as the conditions of detention while awaiting execution, are examples of factors capable of bringing the treatment or punishment received by the condemned person within the proscription under Article 3 ( see Soering, cited above, p. 41, § 104). Attitudes in the Contracting States to capital punishment are relevant for assessing whether the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded ( see Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, § 133, ECHR 2003 ‑ V). The Court has also found that, as a general principle, the youth of the person concerned is a circumstance which is liable, with others, to put in question the compatibility with Article 3 of measures connected with a death sentence ( see Soering, cited above, pp. 40-43, §§ 103 ‑ 08)."

While the establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of that country under general international law, whether under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment ( see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005 ‑ I, and Soering, cited above, pp. 35 -36, §§ 89-91)."

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be “inhuman” or “degrading”, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate punishment ( see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 14-15, §§ 29-30). The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment or punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration and its physical or mental effects ( see Soering, cited above, p. 39, § 100). In assessing the evidence, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, pp. 64-65, § 161, and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 111, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV). A “ reasonable doubt” is not a doubt based on a merely theoretical possibility or raised in order to avoid a disagreeable conclusion, but a doubt for which reasons can be drawn from the facts presented (see the “ Greek case ”, applications nos. 3321/67, 3322/67, 3323/67 and 3344/67, Commission's report of 5 November 1969, and, mutatis mutandis, Naumenko v. Ukraine, no. 42023/98, § 109, 10 February 2004 ).

Having regard to the endemic violence which has held sway in the Chechen Republic since the beginning of the conflict and to the climate of impunity which reigns in that region (see the relevant passages in paragraphs 267 to 270 above), the Court has no doubt that the applicants'fear of being confronted with a threat to their lives or treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention was subjectively well-founded and genuinely perceived as such. The subjective view of events which may arouse feelings of fear or uncertainty in an individual with regard to his or her fate is, without any doubt, an important factor to be taken into account when assessing the facts (see paragraphs 378- 81 and 445 below).

The parties do not dispute that the Georgian Procurator- General also obtained verbal assurances from his Russian colleagues (see paragraph 184 above).

In so far as the Court has had no opportunity to test the reasonableness of these allegations in the specific case of the extradited applicants, it must rely on the evidence contained in those documents that it has obtained of its own motion ( see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, p. 36, §§ 107 and 108, and Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, p. 64, § 160)."

Covered in blood and with a serious eye injury, he was allegedly dragged along the corridor “like a corpse” and transferred in this state to the airport (see paragraphs 125 and 135 above). Mr Baymurzayev's jawbone had allegedly been broken by truncheon blows.

France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 95, ECHR 1999 ‑ V ). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3, and the assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case (see also paragraph 338 above). Treatment is considered to be “inhuman” if, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering (see, inter alia, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 92, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI ). The Court wishes to emphasise that a State is liable for all persons in detention, since the latter, in the hands of the State's employees, are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them ( see Berktay v. Turkey, no. 22493/93, § 167, 1 March 2001, and Algür v. Turkey, no. 32574/96, § 44, 22 October 2002 ). However, the Court cannot ignore the potential for violence in a prison setting, nor the threat that disobedience on the part of inmates may well degenerate into bloodshed requiring the prison authorities to enlist the help of the security forces ( see Satık and Others v. Turkey, no. 31866/96, § 58, 10 October 2000 ). Nevertheless, in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 ( see Tekin v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ IV, pp. 1517- 18, § § 52 and 53, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV )."

The Court considers it established that the use of force occurred between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. and that it was preceded by peaceful attempts on the part of the prison staff to persuade the prisoners to comply with the order to leave the cell (see paragraphs 124, 147 and 148 above)."

Nor, in view of the photographs of the cells in Prison no. 5 (see paragraph 20 above), the assessment report on cell no. 88, the expert report and the statements by various witnesses (see paragraphs 96, 144 et seq. above), does it doubt that the applicants had armed themselves with various objects, including bricks and pieces of metal, with a view to opposing their possible extradition. In those circumstances, the Court accepts the Georgian Government's argument that the intervention of fifteen members of the special forces, armed with truncheons (see paragraphs 124, 151 and 159 above), could reasonably be considered necessary to ensure the safety of the prison staff and prevent disorder spreading throughout the rest of the prison.

Towards three or four o'clock in the morning, prison staff, including the prison governor, ordered the applicants to leave their cell, giving fictitious reasons (disinfection or search), even though a vehicle was already waiting in the neighbouring prison courtyard to transport four of them for transfer to the Russian authorities (see paragraphs 124 and 148 above).

The collective resistance which they offered to the State employees seems to have been linked to the legitimate fears that they experienced at the idea of their extradition (see paragraph 340 above). In the light of the evidence in its possession, the Court considers that the tactic of trickery and speed adopted by the Georgian authorities was intended to trap the applicants and, by presenting them with a fait accompli, to avoid complications (see, mutatis mutandis, Čonka v.

Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII, pp. 3271-72, § 11 ) and the fracture to the left shoulder sustained by Mr Khanchukayev indicate that those applicants'injuries were sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the scope of Article 3 ( see A. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VI, p. 2699, § 21, and Ribitsch v.

By laying down that any deprivation of liberty should be “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 requires, firstly, that any arrest or detention should have a legal basis in domestic law ( see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ III, pp. 850-51, § 50 )."

The initial duration of such detention may not exceed three months and the person concerned may apply to a court in order to protect his or her rights (see paragraph 4 of the same Article).

The Court has recently reiterated that, where there is plausibly asserted to be a risk of irreparable damage to the enjoyment by the applicant of one of the core rights under the Convention, the object of an interim measure is to maintain the status quo pending the Court's determination of the justification for the measure. As such, being intended to ensure the continued existence of the matter that is the subject of the application, the interim measure goes to the substance of the Convention complaint. As far as the applicant is concerned, the result that he or she wishes to achieve through the application is the preservation of the asserted Convention right before irreparable damage is done to it. Consequently, the interim measure is sought by the applicant, and granted by the Court, in order to facilitate the “effective exercise” of the right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention in the sense of preserving the subject matter of the application when that is judged to be at risk of irreparable damage through the acts or omissions of the respondent State. It is implicit in the notion of the effective exercise of the right of application that for the duration of the proceedings in Strasbourg the Court should remain able to examine the application under its normal procedure ( see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, § 108). Indications of interim measures given by the Court, as in the present case, allow it not only to carry out an effective examination of the application but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; they also subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise execution of the final judgment. Such measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention ( ibid., § 125). Thus, in Mamatkulov and Askarov, the Court concluded that a failure by a Contracting State to comply with interim measures is to be regarded as preventing the Court from effectively examining the applicant's complaint and as hindering the effective exercise of his or her right and, accordingly, as a violation of Article 34 ( ibid., § 128)."

Apart from subsidiary reasons (presidential election, possible terrorist act in the North Caucasus, weather conditions or public holidays), the main reason for this refusal has been the claim that, as long as their case remained pending before the Russian courts, contact between the Court's delegation and the applicants detained in Russia would be contrary to the domestic rules of criminal procedure and would infringe the principle of subsidiarity inherent in the machinery of the Convention. An argument alleging that the applicants had not lodged an application with the Court against Russia was also raised (see paragraph 29 above). Conveying the reasoning of the Stavropol Regional Court, the Russian Government claimed that, as the executive branch, they could not interfere in the unfettered power of assessment of the facts enjoyed by that judicial body.

It is not therefore for the Court to assess the merits of the Stavropol Regional Court's refusals, on which the Russian Government seek to rely.

In any event, the conduct of a fact-finding visit, decided by the Court under Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention, does not depend on the progress of domestic proceedings. Contrary to the Government's submissions (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above), such a visit by the Court does not call into question the principle of subsidiarity inherent in the Convention system. Indeed, the Court's fact-finding visit does not replace national supervision by the European supervision introduced by the Convention, but amounts to a procedural measure in the context of that supervision. Through its system of collective enforcement of the rights it establishes, the Convention reinforces, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the protection afforded at national level (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

However, relying on domestic case-law which had not been submitted during the admissibility proceedings, the Government contended that civil summary proceedings based on claims of tort are an effective remedy in the Netherlands Antilles against alleged breaches of the Convention by the administration, and that such proceedings had proved to be effective and swift, even in prison matters."

                "66. The Government were of the opinion that the applicant was free to put his Convention complaints before the civil court in summary proceedings. There was nothing to prevent the applicant from seeking an interim measure in summary proceedings, for which legal representation is not mandatory and, in any event, free legal aid was available to him. Moreover, the applicant was well aware of this possibility because, together with four other inmates of the Point Blanche Penitentiary, he took civil proceedings before the Court of First Instance of St. Maarten, claiming the same remission of sentence granted to detainees in the Koraal Specht Prison on grounds of overcrowding, as well as claiming the right to create an association of detainees in the Penitentiary. This resulted in a judgment of 18 April 1997 in which it was held inter alia that, on the basis of Article 11 of the Convention, inmates could claim the right of assembly and that, consequently, in all reasonableness and for the purposes of formalising the proposed association, the inmates’ representative and notary public could not be refused entry to the Point Blanche Penitentiary. It therefore ordered the authorities of the Netherlands Antilles to allow a notary public entry into the establishment. However, for reasons that are unclear, the applicant failed to avail himself of this remedy."

The applicant refuted the Government’s submissions as regards the effectiveness of such proceedings, as the prison authorities had acted within the rules and regulations in force at the time. Despite the assurances given, the Netherlands Antilles authorities had failed to initiate and implement the necessary changes. The civil courts were thus unable to offer adequate redress. Moreover, the prison authorities would not willingly grant an inmate access to court for an infringement of rules which had not been modified by the Minister of Justice."

However, he submitted that this action was brought by a newly arrived, well ‑ meaning lawyer who supported the inmates’ cause, but who was only prepared to take proceedings on behalf of a group and for a fee that was not within the reach of the individual inmate. Whilst the sum was relative to the total costs of the action, it still represented a considerable sum for many inmates. The applicant is therefore of the opinion that the concept of free and easy access to the courts, as submitted by the respondent Government, does not reflect the reality. Finally, he contended that there is ample evidence to demonstrate that, even when courts give a ruling, the administration is not swift in its implementation."

France (no. 25803/94, §§ 74-77, ECHR 1999-V): The purpose of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Convention institutions. However, the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time.",

One such reason may be the national authorities’ remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed execute a court order. In such circumstances, the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.",

Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 18, § 37).

Furthermore, the Court has regard to the findings and recommendations contained in various reports by, inter alia, the CPT on the conditions of detention in the Netherlands Antilles at the material time. The Court cannot but conclude that, in the absence of convincing explanations from the Government for their failure to take the necessary measures within a reasonable time to repair the structural problems criticised in these reports, and to observe the aforementioned court orders, there were special circumstances at the material time which dispensed the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the remedy suggested by the Government."

That interference with the applicant’s rights had been justified, for it had served the protection of the rights of the third persons concerned. In view of roughly 45,000 covertly recorded telephone conversations, it had been rather probable that private, even intimate conversations without any relation to the events under examination had also been captured. There had been a statutory obligation to not listen to those (parts of the) recorded conversations. During examination of the conversations by the lawyer and/or the applicant this obligation had been enforced by the presence of a supervising police officer, who had also been present in order to support the applicant’s lawyer with questions regarding the analysis of the data.

Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211).

The accused must have the opportunity to organise his or her defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility of putting all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus of influencing the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, 30 September 1985, opinion of the Commission, § 53, Series A no. 96; Connolly v. the United Kingdom, no. 27245/95, Commission decision of 26 June 1996; and Mayzit v.

The term material evidence cannot be construed narrowly in the sense that it cannot be confined to evidence considered as relevant by the prosecution.

The Court has also held that the entitlement to such disclosure of material evidence is not an absolute right. In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1.

Upon arrest and later again upon indictment they provided him with a comprehensive overview of the accusations as well as the adduced evidence. They provided him not only with a copy of the investigation file, but also forwarded updates of that file at all times, including copies of the twenty-eight transcripts of telecommunication-surveillance data and around 1,100 printouts of electronic files (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). The applicant has not claimed, nor is there any other indication, that data, files or documents which formed part of that paper file and/or should have done so because they were the basis for the indictment and conviction were not transmitted to his lawyer early enough in order to allow him to acquaint himself with them before or during the trial and potentially adjust the defence."

Within this frame of time, the possibilities to access the file were essentially unrestricted. Therefore, the Court considers that the applicant’s lawyer had the possibility to acquaint himself with the investigation file, regardless of the specific numbers of pages and volumes of that file. This is all the more true as the applicant had two other lawyers, who, according to the submissions of the parties, never requested access to the investigation file. The possibilities of contact between the lawyer and the detained applicant in order to prepare the defence were also not unduly restricted. The Court therefore considers that there were sufficient possibilities for the applicant’s lawyer to discuss the investigation file in detail with him, in order to effectively prepare the defence."

As they were considered irrelevant to the charges by the police and/or the prosecution, they were in fact kept in storage on police computers. In this connection, the Court further observes that the prosecution and the courts were, in acquainting themselves with the case, also essentially confined to the investigation file and the evidence later produced in the hearing. They did make use of neither the entirety nor a single one of those other files and subsequently based neither the applicant’s indictment nor his conviction on them.

The Court furthermore notes that, subsequently, although the authorities did not provide the applicant’s lawyer with a copy of the telecommunication-surveillance data, he was allowed to examine that data initially in the police premises upon appointment during regular opening hours and on the presence of a police officer, and, as of 9 May 2012 additionally upon appointment during regular opening hours on the prison premises together with the applicant, also in the presence of a police officer (see paragraph 19 above).

There had been a statutory obligation to prevent private and even intimate parts of the recorded conversations being listened to, which had been essential for the legitimisation of telecommunication surveillance as such, and which therefore had had to be enforced by the presence of a police officer. These explanations, which the applicant essentially did not oppose, appear reasonable to the Court."

The applicant moreover complained that it had not been possible for his lawyer to listen to and read the entirety of the telecommunication ‑ surveillance data, due to the time constraints and its significant volume. The Government were of the opinion that it had not been necessary to allow for the possibility to listen to each and every recording and read each and every text message. The Court is indeed satisfied that, in view of the complexity of the criminal proceedings at issue (see Gregačević v. Croatia, no. 58331/09, § 53, 10 July 2012), it was not necessary to allow for the opportunity that the applicant’s lawyer read through and listen to each and every single item of the telecommunication ‑ surveillance data. Rather, it was, in principle, sufficient to allow an effective opportunity for the applicant’s lawyer to analyse the recordings and text messages in order to identify and then listen or read those which he considered to be of relevance. In this connection, the Court is mindful of the fact that modern investigation means may indeed produce, as in the present case, enormous amounts of data, the integration of which into the criminal proceedings should not cause unnecessary delays to those proceedings. It therefore considers that the applicant’s right to disclosure must not be confused with his right of access to all material already considered as relevant by the authorities, which will generally require for the possibility to comprehend the material in its entirety (see, as an exception, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, §§ 581-85)."

                "68. In so far as the applicant complained that his lawyer had not been, given sufficient opportunity to identify relevant recordings and text messages, the Court observes that the responsible police officer supported the applicant’s lawyer, who was likely not acquainted with the software to analyse the telecommunication-surveillance data. Initially, the police provided the applicant’s lawyer with the data produced in respect of certain search parameters of his choosing (see paragraph 12 above). Subsequently, it provided him with lists containing substantial amounts of information on the retrieved telecommunication data (see paragraph 15 above). In so far as the applicant alleged that the lists had fallen short of what he had requested, he has not substantiated why it would not have been possible to identify relevant data by substantially reducing the amount to actually listen to on the basis of search parameters and the provided lists. In fact, it appears that it was possible to narrow down the search by looking for specific telephone lines, for connections between specific telephones lines, within a certain frame of time, overall allowing for substantial reduction of the data with potential relevance. Moreover, the applicant’s lawyer, who could have been expected to arrange for at least some shift in the emphasis of his work (see Mattick v. Germany (dec.), no. 62116/00, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, with further references), even if appointments with the police and in prison were, in particular due to limited opening hours (see paragraphs 11 and 19), difficult to arrange, only managed to examine the data on twenty-two occasions within more than one year, apparently never together with the applicant on the prison premises and not after 31 October 2012. At the same time, he neither made use of the possibility to have a judicial employee replace him, as the court had suggested, nor can it be taken from the applicant’s submissions that his two other lawyers engaged substantially in the analysing, listening and reading exercise. It also has to be taken into account that the applicant, who had been the one subjected to the surveillance measures, would have known best what specific telecommunication ‑ surveillance data to look for. The Court therefore cannot see that the authorities provided the defence only with an ineffective opportunity to identify the relevant files."

In the case of prisoners over the age of 65, the requirement to work served the purpose of avoiding the harmful effects of detention, for instance the isolation of persons who had reached retirement age, and preventing mental and physical deterioration. The work had to be tailored to the prisoner’s abilities, training and interests, and it was therefore necessary to avoid placing an excessive burden on prisoners over the age of 65.

                "“In accordance with Article 81 of the Swiss Criminal Code (CP, RS 311.0), prisoners are required to work. The requirement to work was retained in the Criminal Code following the revision of the general provisions which came into force on 1 January 2007, as it is an appropriate and necessary tool enabling prisoners to maintain their personal and vocational skills. It was also felt to be essential for keeping order and ensuring the financial management of prisons.",
                "The requirement to work concerns all inmates irrespective of age. Needless to say, it applies only to those prisoners who are actually capable of working. The work must be matched as far as possible to the abilities, training and interests of the prisoner concerned (Article 81 § 1 of the Criminal Code). Work – which, under Article 83 of the Criminal Code, also creates entitlement to payment – should be taken to mean not just gainful employment in the narrow sense but also, for instance, the care of the prisoner’s own children (inside or outside prison). Furthermore, participation in training and further training courses is considered as work and paid under Article 83 § 3 of the Criminal Code.",
                "Under Article 75 § 1 of the Criminal Code, the execution of a custodial sentence should correspond as closely as possible to the conditions of normal life. With regard to prisoners who have reached retirement age, solutions are devised on a case-by-case basis under the above-mentioned provisions.",
                "The requirement to work does not apply to all prisoners to an equal extent, but must be tailored, depending on the circumstances, to prisoners’ abilities and especially to their fitness for work and state of health. Persons with physical difficulties are given only light work, usually on a reduced basis. Prisoners who have a medical certificate stating that they are unfit to work are exempted from the obligation to work. The issue of the growing number of prisoners of retirement age has been recognised, although the number is still very small. In 2012 a special wing for retired prisoners was opened in the new Lenzburg Central Prison. The Judicial Enforcements Office of the Canton of Zürich has set up a special project dealing with this issue.”"

The work which prisoners aged over 65 were required to carry out in this closed system had three main characteristics. Firstly, the five closed institutions in question sought to devise individual programmes for prisoners aged over 65 in order to find appropriate activities that matched their abilities. Secondly, the work carried out by these prisoners usually had little in common with ordinary work carried out by employees outside prison or by prisoners who had not reached retirement age. Thirdly, the emphasis was on giving structure to everyday life and maintaining a suitable level of activity. In other words, the requirement for prisoners aged over 65 to work was designed to enable them to remain as autonomous as possible and to maintain their cognitive, intellectual and motor faculties."

Five of them, including the applicant, were in the “dependent and retired prisoners” wing ( Abteilung für Sucht und Pensionäre ). Prisoners’ activities were geared to their physical and mental abilities, irrespective of the nature and length of their sentence. On account of their simplicity and the minimal physical effort they entailed, the activities offered in that wing could not be compared to the work carried out in the other prison workshops, but more closely resembled the activities on offer in psychiatric clinics or sheltered workshops for persons with physical or mental difficulties."

The Court regarded this definition as a starting-point for the interpretation of Article 4 of the Convention but noted that sight should not be lost of the Convention’s special features or of the fact that it was a living instrument to be read “in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States” (see Van der Mussele, cited above, § 32)."

It acknowledges that suitable and reasonable work may help to structure daily life and maintain an appropriate level of activity, both of which are important goals as regards the well-being of long-term prisoners.

Furthermore, according to the Federal Council, persons with physical difficulties are required only to perform light tasks, usually on a reduced basis. Prisoners who are unfit to work, as certified by a doctor, are exempted from the requirement to work.

As regards the practice of the Council of Europe member States, the Court notes that the comparative survey of twenty-eight countries shows that, in sixteen of those countries, sentenced prisoners are not required to work after reaching retirement age. In the remaining twelve member States surveyed, the issue is not explicitly addressed in domestic law. However, these countries usually provide for exemptions from the requirement for prisoners to work, notably on account of their capacities and their age. Consequently, the arrangements put in place by these countries resemble the approach taken in Switzerland. The Court therefore concludes that, in the absence of sufficient consensus among the Council of Europe member States on the requirement for prisoners to work after they have reached retirement age, the Swiss authorities enjoyed a considerable margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132)."

In the case before it, it observes that the wording of Rule 105.2 is quite open and that it does not impose a uniform regime as regards the requirement for prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In any event, the Court considers that this Rule should not necessarily be interpreted as completely prohibiting the member States from requiring prisoners who have reached retirement age to work. In the present case the Court does not deem it necessary to provide a definitive answer to this question, bearing in mind that the member States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation when it comes to implementation of this Rule by the prison authorities, who are in any event better placed than the Court to assess issues linked to conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners. In that regard the Court takes the view that it is primarily for the domestic authorities to establish effective and practicable conditions and arrangements with a view to organising their prison systems, while at the same time complying with the requirements of the Convention."

It is applied only in connection with certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or with offences which the courts consider to warrant a particularly harsh sentence, regard being had to the criteria listed in Articles 132 and 133 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), including the offender’s personal situation, and also to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The measure is not applied, therefore, to all individuals sentenced to a term of imprisonment but only to those sentenced to a prison term of three years or more.

Three years after having finished serving his sentence, he can apply for rehabilitation, which is conditional on a consistent and genuine display of good conduct and extinguishes any outstanding ancillary penalty (Articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 38 above). In addition, the length of the sentence actually served may be reduced in accordance with the early release mechanism provided for in section 54 (1) of Law no. 354 of 1975, under the terms of which a reduction of forty-five days for every six months served is granted if the detainee takes part in the re-education scheme (see paragraph 39 above).

In that judgment, in listing the criteria to be taken into account when examining the proportionality of a disenfranchisement measure for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, besides ruling out automatic and blanket restrictions the Court said that it was an essential element “that the decision on disenfranchisement should be taken by a judge”. It also considered that such a measure should be accompanied by specific reasoning “explaining why in the circumstances of the specific case disenfranchisement was necessary” (see Frodl, cited above, §§ 34-35)."

The Grand Chamber points out that the Hirst judgment makes no explicit mention of the intervention of a judge among the essential criteria for determining the proportionality of a disenfranchisement measure. The relevant criteria relate solely to whether the measure is applicable generally, automatically and indiscriminately within the meaning indicated by the Court (see paragraphs 85, 86 and 96 above). While the intervention of a judge is in principle likely to guarantee the proportionality of restrictions on prisoners’ voting rights, such restrictions will not necessarily be automatic, general and indiscriminate simply because they were not ordered by a judge. Indeed, the circumstances in which the right to vote is forfeited may be detailed in the law, making its application conditional on such factors as the nature or the gravity of the offence committed."

But these are considerations of a general nature: they did not concern the applicant’s particular situation and, unlike the arguments based on the general, automatic and indiscriminate nature of the disenfranchisement, they are not reiterated in paragraph 82 of the Hirst judgment, where the criteria for assessing the proportionality of the impugned measure are set out."

In addition, according to the comparative-law data in the Court’s possession (see paragraphs 45-48 above), arrangements for restricting the right of convicted prisoners to vote vary considerably from one national legal system to another, particularly as to the need for such restrictions to be ordered by a court. Only nineteen of the States examined impose no restrictions on the voting rights of convicted prisoners. Of the remaining twenty-four States, which do apply restrictions to varying degrees, eleven require a decision of the criminal court on a case-by-case basis (with some exceptions where the most serious sentences are concerned – as in Greece and Luxembourg)."

In particular, with a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 84, and Greens and M.T., cited above, § 113), the Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners’ voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied. In this latter case, it will be for the legislature itself to balance the competing interests in order to avoid any general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction.

There is no mention of the impugned measure in the judgments by which he was convicted (see paragraph 22 above). The removal of the applicant’s right to vote was the result of his being barred from public office, an ancillary penalty applied, under Article 29 of the Criminal Code, to any individual sentenced, like the applicant, to life imprisonment or a prison sentence of five years or more (see paragraphs 21 and 36 above)."

In this latter case, prisoners sentenced by the courts to three years’ imprisonment or more forfeit the right to vote temporarily, for five years, while those sentenced to five years or more, or to life imprisonment, permanently forfeit the right to vote (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above)."

It is applied only in connection with certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or with offences which the courts consider to warrant a particularly harsh sentence, regard being had to the criteria listed in Articles 132 and 133 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), including the offender’s personal situation, and also to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The measure is not applied, therefore, to all individuals sentenced to a term of imprisonment but only to those sentenced to a prison term of three years or more. Italian law also adjusts the duration of the measure to the sentence imposed and thus, by the same token, to the gravity of the offence: the disenfranchisement is for five years for sentences of three to five years and permanent for sentences of five years or more."

Furthermore, the Court cannot underestimate the fact that under Italian law it is possible for a convicted person who has been permanently deprived of the right to vote to recover that right. Three years after having finished serving his sentence, he can apply for rehabilitation, which is conditional on a consistent and genuine display of good conduct and extinguishes any outstanding ancillary penalty (Articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 38 above). In addition, the length of the sentence actually served may be reduced in accordance with the early release mechanism provided for in section 54 (1) of Law no. 354 of 1975, under the terms of which a reduction of forty-five days for every six months served is granted if the detainee takes part in the re-education scheme (see paragraph 39 above).

Hence there is an obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on the author ’ s freedom of expression (see Müller and Others v. Switzerland, 24 May 1988, § § 27 and 33, Series A no. 133 ). It is noteworthy that in reaching that conclusion the Court noted that Article 10 of the Convention does not specify that freedom of artistic expression comes within its ambit; but neither, on the other hand, does it distinguish between the various forms of expression ( ibid. , § 27 )."

The applicant Party ’ s objection was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which held that the Municipal Council ’ s decision had been justified because the leaflets disseminated by the applicant political party had contained such slogans as “Down with Voronin ’ s totalitarian regime” and “Down with Putin ’ s occupation regime”. The Court of Appeal also recalled that during a previous demonstration organised by the applicant political party to protest against the presence of the Russian military in Transdniestria, the protesters had burned a picture of the President of the Russian Federation and a Russian flag. In its judgment the Court held that the applicant party ’ s slogans, even if they had been accompanied by the burning of flags and pictures, were a form of expressing an opinion in respect of an issue of major public interest, namely the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova ( no. 25196/04, § § 9 and 27, 2 February 2010 )."

Nor does it deem it necessary to examine whether the applicant ’ s expression of his resentment towards the figure of Atatürk or his criticism of Kemalist ideology amounted to an “insult”, or whether the domestic authorities had any regard to the applicant ’ s freedom of expression, which he had brought to their attention on a number of occasions (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above).

They maintained that the restriction on the right to vote in Turkey was not a “ blanket ban ” because the applicable legislation limited the scope of the restriction in accordance with the nature of the offence. Referring to the judgment in the case of Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) ( [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX ), the Government argued that, unlike the situation in the United Kingdom, the Turkish legislation restricting the right to vote was only applicable to persons who had committed offences intentionally. In the United Kingdom the legislation was applicable to all convicted prisoners detained in prisons, irrespective of the length of their sentence, the nature or gravity of the offence, and their individual circumstances."

                "75. In Turkey the constitutional provisions concerning the issue of prisoners ’ voting rights had undergone two amendments in 1995 and 2001. In 1995 the Constitution had been amended to exclude remand prisoners from the scope of the restriction because disenfranchising a person detained in prison pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against him was considered incompatible with the principle of presumption of innocence. In the 2001 amendment, persons convicted of offences committed involuntarily had been excluded from the restrictions on voting. As it stood today, the national legislation was applicable only in respect of offences committed intentionally. In the opinion of the Government, offences committed intentionally were “stronger” in nature as they included the element of “intention”."

The Court points out that the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law; a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on the right to vote applied to all convicted prisoners serving sentences is incompatible with that Article (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, §§ 58 and 82 ). These principles were subsequently reaffirmed by the Grand Chamber in the case of Scoppola (no. 3) (cited above, §§ 82-84, 96, 99 and 101-102 ). The Court also reiterates that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 applies only to the election of the “legislature” (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, § 71, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

Furthermore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, his disenfranchisement did not end when he was conditionally released from prison on 11 June 2013, but will continue until the date initially foreseen for his release, 22 October 2018 (see paragraph 24 above). Thus, between 5 February 2007 and 22 October 2018, that is, for a period of over eleven years, the applicant has been and will be unable to vote.

It has noted moreover that the Turkish legislation contains no express provisions categorising or specifying offences for which disenfranchisement is foreseen and that the automatic and indiscriminate application of this harsh measure in Turkey regarding a vitally important Convention right does not fall within any acceptable margin of appreciation (see Söyler, cited above, §§ 36-47)."

The court reiterated that one of the main criteria in assessing whether to award compensation for a breach of personality rights was the degree of culpability on the part of a respondent, which, in the given case, could not be established. It further argued that the term “ in so far as possible” concerning the three square metre living space in section 137 of Decree no. 6/1996. (VII.12.)

That case originated in a civil action brought by a Mr A.B. who argued that he had not received adequate medical care in detention, that he had been detained in overcrowded cells without the necessary personal space, that his freedom of religion had been restricted and that he had not received dietary nutrition prescribed for him.",

It held that the detention facility had acted unlawfully when it infringed section 137 of Decree no. 6/1996. by failing to secure 3 square metres space per inmate. The court concluded that the plaintiff had suffered, during his detention, a disadvantage not inherent in a sentence of imprisonment, on account of the aggregation of overcrowded prison conditions and the lack of medical care, and awarded him 250,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 750 euros (EUR) ) as non-pecuniary damage for the violation of his personality rights.",

                "“37. The Hungarian prison authorities indicated that action to combat prison overcrowding has continued to be a major issue. Indeed, the prison population has followed an upward trend over recent years: it stood at 18,120 inmates for the available accommodation of 12,573 places at the time of the 2013 visit, as compared with 15,367 prisoners for 12,566 places during the previous visit in 2009. In other words, the overpopulation rate doubled in four years (i.e. from 22 % to 44 %).",
                "Several interlocutors explained such a situation by, among other things, stricter criminal policies, the underuse of alternatives to imprisonment and the failure to increase substantially the number of places in prison to meet the demand.",
                "The delegation also learned with concern that, following a 2010 amendment to the rules on enforcement of prison sentences and pre-trial detention, the observance of 3 m² of living space per male prisoners and of 3.5 m² of living space per juvenile or women in cells (not counting floor space taken up by cell equipment) was no longer a strict legal requirement but more an objective [1].",
                "Most of the delegation ’ s interlocutors, including senior prison officials, indicated that the situation was likely to worsen with the entry into force, in July 2013, of a number of new criminal provisions which may well result in an even higher number of persons being sent to prison and/or being imprisoned for far longer terms ...",
                "79. Not surprisingly, overcrowding was evident in the cells seen by the delegation (e.g. ten inmates sharing a cell of some 27 m², including the space taken up by the toilet, at Somogy County Prison; three inmates in a cell of about 8 m² at Sopronkőhida Prison).",
                "At Sopronkőhida Prison, a large number of cells were already substandard for single occupancy (i.e. as small as 5 m², including the in-cell toilet, and with no more than 1.5 m between the walls) and were in fact accommodating two inmates ... It should be added that many inmates were accommodated in such conditions for up to 23 hours a day and for years on end.",
                "In both establishments, the situation could be particularly bad in the transit cells where each inmate could have as little as 1.6 m² of living space for days on end, including at weekends (e.g. while awaiting departure on the following Monday).",
                "80. The CPT recommends that the Hungarian authorities strive to combat overcrowding and ensure that cells are of an appropriate size for their intended occupancy at Somogy County and Sopronkőhida Prisons, in the light of the recommendations made in paragraphs 40 and 77. As regards transit cells at Sopronkőhida Prison, organisational steps should be taken to ensure that they are not used at weekends. ”",
                "In their response, the Government made the following observations concerning overcrowding:",
                "“The CPT delegation ’ s position is that since their last visit in 2009, prison overcrowding has doubled – they made this observation based on the fact that the overpopulation rate (the rate exceeding the 100%) has grown double (from 122% to 144% in a national average). Such a presentation of accommodation can be misleading because – though mathematically correct –in superficial interpretation it could suggest that the overcrowding (that is, the number of the prisoners) has doubled. To avoid this, but still properly emphasizing the magnitude and the gravity of the accommodation problem it is recommended to specify that in the course of the last 4 years the overcrowding of the prisons has increased by a further 22%, to 144%.",
                "The Report also notes that during the visits the CPT received adequate information about the causes of overcrowding, and about the method of handling it. It should be emphasized that the Prison Service is under the general obligation of providing accommodation, and it cannot significantly affect either the number or the temporal and geographical distribution of the admissions. The Government has worked out a new standpoint about subsequent adjustments with a view to long-term planning; by starting a new, comprehensive, multi-year programme for capacity expansion, and by placing the execution of the tasks of the Prison Service on new footing.",
                "The aim of the programme is the uniform distribution of the additional responsibilities among the institutions. While agreeing with the fact that the programme is neither the sole nor the long-term solution, it should be emphasized that the work invested in it is not in vain, because it prevents much more serious – with the wording of the Report – problems than those caused.",
                "The overcrowding “balancing” programme gives high priority to the principles of regionalism and individuality, the transfer of each prisoner is dealt with individually with the aim of not to weaken contacts with relatives, but the number of transfers should not increase significantly because of ensuring possibility to maintain contacts.",
                "The CPT ’ s proposal, in which it recommends to increase the minimum size of the inmates ’ living space, is currently controlled by suitable legal standards, which include regulations with specific figures concerning the airspace and sufficient room to be provided. Following the 2010 amendment to the Act, the Government clearly stated that they intend to take decisive actions to eliminate overcrowding, because accommodation cannot be provided according to the previous regulations with the present number of inmates.",
                "At this moment the standards for minimum size of the inmates ’ living space are regulated in paragraph 137 of the Decree of the Ministry of Justice no. 6/1996 (VII. 12.) on the execution of imprisonment and pre-trial detention as it follows:",
                "Number of convicted persons in a cell or living space should be determined in a way that ensures at least 6 m3 airspace and if it is possible in case of men 3 m3 and in case of juvenile or women 3, 5 m2 space per person.",

To prove the effectiveness of that remedy, they referred to the judgment of the Budapest High Court of 26 March 2013, awarding HUF 250,000 as compensation for the inadequate conditions of Mr A.B. ’ s detention. That court had held that the detention facility had acted in breach of the national rules on minimum living space, which caused the plaintiff more suffering than was inherent in detention (see paragraph 1 6 above).",

The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 33-34, Series A no. 40; Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30 210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; Vučković and Others v. Serbia [GC], no. 17153/11, § 75, 25 March 2014 )."

Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI ). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, amongst other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 77, ECHR 1999 ‑ V ). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Zornić v.

The scope of the Contracting States ’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint; the “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred ( see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII ). Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Mohammed v.

If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Sergey Babushkin v. Russia, no. 5993/08, § 40, 28 November 2013)."

In contrast to cases concerning the length of judicial proceedings or non-enforcement of judgments, where the Court has accepted in principle that a compensatory remedy alone may suffice (see Scordino v.

Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 99, ECHR 2009 ), the existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. The special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court ’ s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weaken the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements (see Yarashonen v.

In the present case, the authorities acknowledged that the Hungarian prisons were overcrowded and that in the material period the average rate of occupancy of Budapest Prison was 150% (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Consequently, the Court observes that, in the circumstances of the present case, the remedies referred to by the Government were not capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaint.

The prison authorities would not be in a position to enforce a large number of simultaneous requests, given the structural nature of the problem (see, mutatis mutandis, Ananyev v.

                "68. The following relevant principles have been established in the Court ’ s case-law concerning assessment of evidence under Article 3 (see Ananyev v. Russia, cited above §§ 121-123):",
                "121. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII; Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 26, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII).",
                "122. The Court is mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by the applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about the conditions of their detention. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government.",
                "123. The Court has held on many occasions that cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant ’ s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations (see Gubin v. Russia, no. 8217/04, § 56, 17 June 2010, and Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts))."

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour (see, for example, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25)."

In the context of deprivation of liberty the Court has consistently stressed that, to fall under Article 3, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering and humiliation connected with the detention. The State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 141; Kudła, cited above, §§ 92-94; and Popov v.

In particular, the Court has to have regard to the following three elements: (a) each detainee must have an individual sleeping place in the cell; (b) each must dispose of at least 3 square metres of floor space; and (c) the overall surface area of the cell must be such as to allow detainees to move freely between items of furniture. The absence of any of the above elements creates in itself a strong presumption that the conditions of detention amounted to degrading treatment and were in breach of Article 3 (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 148)."

In a number of cases where the applicants had at their disposal less than 3 square metres of floor surface, the Court considered the overcrowding to be so severe as to justify of itself a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, §§ 102 ‑ 103, 28 March 2006; Dmitriy Sazonov v. Russia, no. 30268/03, §§ 31-32, 1 March 2012; Nieciecki v. Greece, no. 11677/11, §§ 49-51, 4 December 2012; Kanakis v.

However, the Court has so far refrained from determining how much space should be allocated to a detainee in terms of the Convention, having considered that a number of other relevant factors, such as the duration of detention, the possibilities for outdoor exercise, the physical and mental condition of the detainee and so forth, play an important part in deciding whether the detention conditions complied with the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention (see Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 92, 19 July 2007; and Torreggiani and Others, cited above, § 69 ). Furthermore, the Court notes that, as opposed to pre-trial detention facilities and high-security prisons where inmates are confined to their cell for most of the day, when assessing the issue of overcrowding in post-trial detention facilities such as correctional colonies, it considered that the personal space in the dormitory should be viewed in the context of the applicable regime, providing for a wider freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees in correctional colonies during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Insanov v.

Applying this approach, the Court has found that the strong presumption that the conditions of detention amounted to degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 on account of a lack of personal space, set out in the Ananyev case (see paragraph 74 above), were refuted by the cumulative effect of the conditions of detention, in particular the brevity of the applicant ’ s incarceration (see, for example, Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, § 138, 17 January 2012; and Dmitriy Rozhin v.

The violations of Article 3 found in the previous judgments, as well as those found in the present case, originated in prison facilities that were located in various administrative entities of Hungary and in geographically diverse regions. Nevertheless, the set of facts underlying these violations was substantially similar: detainees suffered inhuman and degrading treatment on account of an acute lack of personal space in their cells, restriction on access to shower facilities and outdoor activities and lack of privacy when using the sanitary facilities. It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Hungarian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in detention facilities throughout Hungary (compare Broniowski, § 189; and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above)."

The evidence submitted by the United States’ authorities shows that not all inmates who are convicted of international terrorism offences are housed at ADX. Therefore, while it may well be the case that, as Professor Rovner states, inmates convicted of terrorism offences were sent to ADX soon after 11 September 2001 (despite years of good conduct in other, less secure federal prisons), the applicants have not shown that they would be detained at ADX merely as a result of conviction for terrorism offences. Instead, it is clear from the declarations submitted by the Government, particularly that of Mr Milusnic, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons applies accessible and rational criteria when deciding whether to transfer an inmate to ADX. Placement is accompanied by a high degree of involvement of senior officials within the Bureau who are external to the inmate’s current institution. Their involvement and the requirement that a hearing be held before transfer provide an appropriate measure of procedural protection. There is no evidence to suggest that such a hearing is merely window dressing. Even if the transfer process were unsatisfactory, there would be recourse to both the Bureau’s administrative remedy programme and the federal courts, by bringing a claim under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to cure any defects in the process. Despite the third party interveners’ submission that recourse to the courts is difficult, the fact that Fourteenth Amendment cases have been brought by inmates at ADX shows that such difficulties can be overcome."

For the second complaint, ADX’s restrictive conditions, it is true that the present applicants are not physically dangerous and that, as the Court has observed at paragraph 211 above, it must be particularly attentive to any decision to place prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly in solitary confinement. However, as the applicants’ current detention in high security facilities in the United Kingdom demonstrates, the United States’ authorities would be justified in considering the applicants, if they are convicted, as posing a significant security risk and justifying strict limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world. There is nothing to indicate that the United States’ authorities would not continually review their assessment of the security risk which they considered the applicants to pose. As Ms Rangel has indicated, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has well-established procedures for reviewing an inmate’s security classification and carrying out reviews of that classification in six-monthly program reviews and three-yearly progress reports. Moreover, as the Department of Justice’s most recent letters show, the United States’ authorities have proved themselves willing to revise and to lift the special administrative measures which have been imposed on terrorist inmates thus enabling their transfer out of ADX to other, less restrictive institutions (see paragraph 97 above)."

This does not mean, however, that inmates are kept in complete sensory isolation or total social isolation. Although inmates are confined to their cells for the vast majority of the time, a great deal of in-cell stimulation is provided through television and radio channels, frequent newspapers, books, hobby and craft items and educational programming. The range of activities and services provided goes beyond what is provided in many prisons in Europe. Where there are limitations on the services provided, for example restrictions on group prayer, these are necessary and inevitable consequences of imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 68, ECHR 2007 ‑ V). The restrictions are, for the most part, reasonably related to the purported objectives of the ADX regime (cf. Csüllog, cited above, concerning unnecessary restrictions, such as a prohibition on tea-bags and books).",

The extent of those opportunities would be of considerable assistance to the applicants who would, by their extradition, be separated from their families in the United Kingdom.",

While inmates are in their cells talking to other inmates is possible, admittedly only through the ventilation system. During recreation periods inmates can communicate without impediment. Indeed, as Mr Milusnic indicates, most inmates spend their recreation periods talking (see his declaration at paragraph 85 above).",
                "In addition, although it is of some concern that outdoor recreation can be withdrawn for periods of three months for seemingly minor disciplinary infractions, the Court places greater emphasis on the fact that, according to Mr Milusnic, inmates’ recreation has only been cancelled once for security reasons and that the periods of recreation have been increased from five to ten hours per week.",

If an applicant were at real risk of being detained indefinitely at ADX, then it would be possible for conditions to reach the minimum level of severity required for a violation of Article 3. Indeed, this may well be the case for those inmates who have spent significant periods of time at ADX. However, the figures provided by the United States’ authorities, although disputed by the applicants, show that there is a real possibility for the applicants to gain entry to the step down or special security unit programs. First, the Department of Justice’s letter of 26 September 2011 shows that while there were 252 inmates in ADX’s General Population Unit, 89 inmates were in the step down program. The figures provided in that letter for the special security unit program, when compared with the November 2010 figures given by Mr Milusnic, demonstrated that inmates are progressing through that program too. Second, Ms Rangel’s declarations show that inmates with convictions for international terrorism have entered the step down program and, in some cases, have completed it and been transferred to other institutions. Ms Rangel’s declaration is confirmed by the Rezaq et al v. Nalley et al judgment of the District Court where the petitioners, all convicted international terrorists, had brought proceedings to obtain entry to the step down program but, by the time the matter came to judgment, had completed the program and been transferred elsewhere (see paragraph 112 above)."

Finally, to the extent that the first, third and fifth applicants rely on the fact that they have been diagnosed with various mental health problems, the Court notes that those mental health conditions have not prevented their being detained in high-security prisons in the United Kingdom.

The Court accordingly finds that there would not be a violation of Article 3 in respect of these applicants in respect of their possible detention at ADX.",

                "243. The Court now turns to the facts of each case. It is convenient first to consider the cases of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants who face, at most, discretionary life sentences.",
                "First, the Court observes that it is by no means certain that, if extradited, these applicants would be convicted of the charges against them. If they are, it is also by no means certain that discretionary life sentences would be imposed, particularly when none of the charges they face carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Nonetheless, the Court considers that it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that discretionary life sentences are possible.",
                "Second, it is necessary to consider whether such sentences would be grossly disproportionate. In this connection the Court observes that, while the offences with which these applicants are charged vary, all of them concern involvement in or support for terrorism. Given the seriousness of terrorism offences (particularly those carried out or inspired by Al-Qaeda) and the fact that the life sentences could only be imposed on these applicants after the trial judge considered all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, the Court considers that discretionary life sentences would not be grossly disproportionate in their cases.",
                "Third, as the Court has observed, in respect of a discretionary life sentence, an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: (i) that the applicant’s continued incarceration no longer serves any legitimate penological purpose; and (ii) the sentence is irreducible de facto and de iure. Given that none of these applicants has been convicted, still less has begun serving any sentences which might be imposed upon conviction (cf. Kafkaris and Léger, cited above, and Iorgov v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 36295/02, 2 September 2010), the Court considers that they have not shown that, upon extradition, their incarceration in the United States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Indeed, if they are convicted and given discretionary life sentences, it may well be that, as the Government have submitted, the point at which continued incarceration would no longer serve any purpose may never arise. It is still less certain that, if that point were ever reached, the United States’ authorities would refuse to avail themselves of the mechanisms which are available to reduce their sentences (see paragraph 130 above and Kafkaris, cited above, § 98).",
                "Accordingly, the Court finds that these applicants have not demonstrated that there would be a real risk of treatment reaching the threshold of Article 3 as a result of their sentences if they were extradited to the United States. The Court therefore finds no violation of Article 3 in their cases."
            ],
            [
                "244. Finally, the Court turns to the case of the fifth applicant. He faces two hundred and sixty-nine counts of murder and thus multiple mandatory sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Court does not find a mandatory life sentence would be grossly disproportionate for such offences, particularly when the fifth applicant has not adduced any evidence of exceptional circumstances which would indicate a significantly lower level of culpability on his part. Indeed, if he is convicted of these charges, it is difficult to conceive of any mitigating factors which would lead a court to impose a lesser sentence than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, even if it had the discretion to do so. Moreover, for the reasons it has given in respect of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants, the Court considers that he has not shown that incarceration in the United States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Therefore, he too has failed to demonstrate that there would be a real risk of treatment reaching the threshold of Article 3 as a result of his sentence if he were extradited to the United States. Accordingly, the Court finds that there would be no violation of Article 3 in his case.",

It found that this, of itself, would not constitute a breach of Article 3. On the question of the compatibility of detention at ADX Florence with Article 3, the High Court relied in particular on the understanding of the prison warden, Mr Robert Wiley, to the effect that if, after a full medical evaluation, it was determined that the fourth applicant could not manage his activities of daily living, it would be highly unlikely that he would be placed at ADX Florence rather than at a medical centre.

Naturally, the most dangerous criminals should expect to be incarcerated in the most secure conditions, but even allowing for a necessarily wide margin of appreciation between the views of different civilised countries about the conditions in which prisoners should be detained, confinement for years and years in what effectively amounts to isolation may well be held to be, if not torture, then ill treatment which contravenes Article 3.

The destruction of a life may be accepted in some special circumstances, such as self-defence or just war; but retributive punishment is never enough to justify it. Yet a prisoner’s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death. He can never atone for his offence. However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life, his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath. Like the death sentence the whole-life tariff is lex talionis. But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner (the only virtue of the lex talionis ) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment, for the whole-life tariff is arbitrary: it may be measured in days or decades according to how long the prisoner has to live. It is therefore liable to be disproportionate – the very vice which is condemned on Article 3 grounds – unless, of course, the death penalty’s logic applies: the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for. But in that case the supposed inalienable value of the prisoner’s life is reduced, merely, to his survival: to nothing more than his drawing breath and being kept, no doubt, confined in decent circumstances.

By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of torture, so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading. That, of course, is not to say that, assuming for example ‘slopping out’ is degrading treatment in Scotland, so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries (see para 27 of Lord Hoffmann’s opinion)... the Strasbourg Court has repeatedly said that the Convention does not ‘purport to be a means of requiring the contracting states to impose Convention standards on other states’ ( Soering, para 86) and article 3 does not bar removal to non-Convention states (whether by way of extradition or simply for the purposes of immigration control) merely because they choose to impose higher levels or harsher measures of criminal punishment.",

Burns [2001] S.C.R. 283, Burns and another (the respondents) were to be extradited from Canada to the State of Washington to stand trial for murders allegedly committed when they were both eighteen. Before making the extradition order the Canadian Minister of Justice had not sought assurances that the death penalty would not be imposed. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the remoteness between the extradition and the potential imposition of capital punishment meant the case was not appropriately considered under section 12 but under section 7. However, the values underlying section 12 could form part of the balancing process engaged under section 7. The extradition of the respondents would, if implemented, deprive them of their rights of liberty and security of person as guaranteed by section 7. The issue was whether such a deprivation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. While extradition could only be refused if it “shocked the conscience” an extradition that violated the principles of fundamental justice would always do so. The court balanced the factors that favoured extradition against those that favoured seeking assurances that the death penalty would not be sought. The latter included the fact that a degree of leniency for youth was an accepted value in the administration of justice, even for young offenders over the age of eighteen. The court concluded that the objectives sought to be advanced by extradition without assurances would be as well served by extradition with assurances. The court held therefore that assurances were constitutionally required by section 7 in all but exceptional cases."

In dismissing the appeals, the Supreme Court affirmed the balancing approach laid down in Burns to determining whether potential sentences in a requesting state would “shock the conscience”. The harsher sentences the appellants might receive if convicted in the United States were among the factors militating against their surrender but they had offered no evidence or case-law to back up their assertions that the possible sentences would shock the conscience of Canadians.

This tended to induce a range of psychological symptoms ranging from panic to psychosis and emotional breakdown. All studies into the effects of supermax detention had found such symptoms after sixty days’ detention. Once such symptoms presented, it was not sufficient to return someone to normal prison conditions in order to remedy them. If supermax detention were imposed for an indeterminate period it also led to chronic despair. Approximately half of suicides in United States prisons involved the 6 ‑ 8% of prisoners held in such conditions. The effects of supermax conditions were worse for someone with pre-existing mental health problems. There was also evidence of solitary confinement leading to a range of physical illnesses.

When he challenged this sanction through the grievance process, it was increased to ninety days. Upon further appeal he was told that the decision was not punitive but a managerial strategy to impress upon him the importance of adhering to institutional procedures. Indoor recreations were little more than cages with a single pull-up bar for exercise. There was nothing to do in outdoor recreation cages save to pace up and down. There was limited visibility – all that could be seen was the sky through chain linking. Recreation was frequently cancelled owing to staff shortages.",

There was evidence of hearings taking place post facto, in some cases many years after the transfer to ADX had been carried out. Inmates also received only twenty-four hours’ notice of a hearing and did not have the right to legal representation. There was evidence that hearing officers did not read all of the evidence submitted and based their decisions on unreliable evidence. Inmates did not see all the evidence against them. Professor Rovner also provided declarations by Arab Muslim clients, in which they stated that they had never been told the reasons for their placement at ADX and had been sent there after 9 September 2011, despite years of good conduct in other, much less restrictive prisons, both in the United States and elsewhere.",
                "Although there had been an increase in the number of admissions to the step down program, the fact remained that many inmates were spending significant periods of time in solitary confinement prior to admission, despite having met the criteria for admission for years. Four clients of the Clinic had only been admitted to the program after periods of between seven and thirteen years in solitary confinement and only then after commencing litigation against the Bureau of Prisons. Another two clients had never been admitted, despite their clean disciplinary records and despite periods of eight to nine years at ADX. Even after the changes to procedures governing entry to the program, an inmate’s original crime continued to serve as the basis for placement at ADX; thus it was possible for an inmate to be unable to sufficiently mitigate the original reason for placement and so gain admission to the program. Moreover, if an inmate had never been told the reasons for his placement, he could not know what he had to do to gain admission to the program. The program required three years to complete and a prisoner needed one year of clear conduct in general population before being eligible for step down. Even eligibility for the program did not mean that a prisoner would be allowed into it.",
                "Conditions in the first phase of the step down program did not differ significantly from general population units. According to one inmate, Mr Rezaq, lockdowns occurred frequently in J Unit, which meant inmates were confined to their cells, and could last days or even weeks. Inmates could also be removed from the program at any time without explanation or due process, even for the most minor infractions. Some had been removed from the program without receiving an incident report or were removed after receiving a report for an incident for which they were soon found not guilty. Yet, following such removals, they were either denied re-admission to the program or forced to spend years going through it again. The Bureau itself had estimated that only 5% of inmates progressed though the program in the minimum three years. Even successful completion of the step down program might only result in a transfer to a “communications management unit”, such as those housed at USP Terre Haute or USP Marion, where conditions remained restrictive.",
                "According to Professor Rovner, it was difficult to dispute the evidence provided by the Government on special administrative measures (owing to restrictions contained in the measures themselves) but, on the basis of public information, she was able to state that the effect of the measures could amount to solitary confinement, even if an inmate was not detained at ADX. The indefinite prolongation of special administrative measures meant that certain Arab-Muslim inmates had spent between five and thirteen years in solitary confinement both before and after trial. Challenging such measures was impossible for inmates without access to legal representation. Legal aid was not available and, even if pro bono legal representation was obtained, the Department of Justice could still refuse to give the lawyers the necessary clearance; this had happened to her Clinic."

The first, dated 2 May 2007 to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, followed a tour the organisation had been given of ADX Florence. The letter expressed concerns that a number of prisoners convicted of terrorism offences had been sent to the prison based on the nature of their crimes and, despite good conduct since their arrival, had remained in general population units and thus outside the step-down programme for up to nine years. The letter made suggestions for improvement in respect of recreation, mail, telephone use, the library. It also noted that progress was to be made on better meeting prisoners’ religious needs, such as the provision of a full-time imam and commended the educational programmes available through the prison’s television system. In the letter Human Rights Watch expressed serious concerns as to prisoners’ inability to do any meaningful exercise in the indoor and outdoor recreation areas, owing to the size of these areas and the lack of any proper equipment. The letter urged the prison authorities to investigate reports of retaliation against prisoners who were on hunger strike in the form of transfer to harsher cells. The letter also said that Human Rights Watch was extremely concerned about the effects of long-term isolation and highly limited exercise on the mental health of prisoners and criticised reports of rushed consultations between prisoners and psychologists, as well as the fact that evaluations were carried out via closed circuit television."

The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement, to ensure inmates receive adequate food, clothing shelter and medical care, and to take reasonable measures to guarantee their safety ( Farmer v. Brennan 511 US 825 (1994). Only those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation ( Wilson v. Seiter 501 U.S. 294, 304 (1991); Rhodes v. Chapman 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981)). A serious deprivation is necessary, because routine discomfort is part of the penalty inmates pay for their crimes ( Hudson v. McMillan 503 US 1 (1992); Sandin v. Conner 515 US 472 (1995)). Thus, in order to establish that a deprivation violates the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner must satisfy: (i) an objective test by demonstrating a sufficiently serious deprivation; and (ii) a subjective test by showing that the conditions of confinement involve the deliberate imposition of pain or deliberate indifference to it ( Wilson, cited above)."

DeRobertis 844 F.2d 1310, 1313 (7 th Cir. 1988)), the lower courts have, for the most part, rejected Eighth Amendment claims arising either from conditions of solitary confinement or from periods of confinement to cells for twenty-two or twenty-three hours per day (see, inter alia, Five Percenters 174 F.3d 471 (4 th Cir. 1999); In re Long Term Admin.

The plaintiffs’ conditions of confinement there were not so extreme as to be atypical and significant. The conditions were also different from those in Wilkinson v. Austin (see paragraph 109 above) in that ADX offered more opportunities for outdoor exercise, interaction with other inmates and educational programmes. There was also insufficient evidence of significant mental harm: there was no evidence that one of the plaintiff’s depression could be attributed to ADX; the remainder of the plaintiffs’ emotional problems were typically experienced by prisoners. Finally, owing to the availability of periodical reviews and the step down program, confinement at ADX was not indeterminate.

Reduction for substantial assistance to the authorities depended on the initiative of the Government, not the court. Subsequent lowering of the relevant sentencing guidelines could only reduce a sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines Commission made the change retroactive and might not reduce the overall sentence if the person concerned was convicted of other offences and given consecutive sentences. For presidential commutation, the FALN pardons had only been for those who had been convicted of non-violent crimes and had been offered on the condition that the individuals concerned renounce violence.

In Graham, cited above, the court held that the Eighth Amendment also prohibited the imposition of life imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide. The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the sentence. Although a State was not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a non-homicide crime, it had to provide some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. The court also held that a sentence lacking in legitimate penological justification (such as retribution, deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation) was, by its nature, disproportionate.

With the abolition of the death penalty in Mauritius, his sentence was commuted to a mandatory life sentence. The Privy Council considered the Court’s judgment in Kafkaris, cited above, and found that the safeguards available in Cyprus to prevent Kafkaris from being without hope of release were not available in Mauritius. The Mauritian Supreme Court had interpreted such a sentence as condemning de Boucherville to penal servitude for the rest of his life and the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not apply. This meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and arbitrary and so contrary to section 10 of the Mauritian Constitution (provisions to secure protection of law, including the right to a fair trial). It had also been argued by the appellant that the mandatory nature of the sentence violated section 7 of the Constitution (the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment). In light of its conclusion on section 10, the Committee considered it unnecessary to decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release under section 75 (the presidential prerogative of mercy).

The Privy Council also considered any differences between mandatory sentences of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and, to this end, quoted with approval the dicta of Lord Justice Laws in Wellington and Lord Bingham in Lichniak (at paragraphs 65 and 142 above)."

A real risk of torture in the receiving State should be an absolute bar on extradition. However, for all other forms of ill-treatment, it was legitimate to consider the policy objectives pursued by extradition in determining whether the ill ‑ treatment reached the minimum level of severity required by Article 3. This was the appropriate means of resolving the tension that existed between the Court’s judgments in Soering, on the one hand, and Chahal and Saadi, on the other. Article 3 could not be interpreted as meaning that any form of ill-treatment in a non-Contracting State would be sufficient to prevent extradition. Such an absolutist approach to Article 3 would mean, for instance, that practices such as head shaving or shackling could act as a bar to extradition because the Court had found these forms of ill-treatment to be in breach of Article 3 (see Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, §§ 114-121, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII (extracts); and Henaf v. France, no. 65436/01, §§ 45-89, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI)."

However, the facts of Soering were wholly exceptional. Both the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany had jurisdiction and the Federal Republic itself had submitted that extradition to the United States would breach the applicant’s Convention rights. In any event, there were no domestic proceedings under way in the United Kingdom for any of the applicants and they could not be prosecuted in the United Kingdom for the full range and gravamen of the conduct alleged against them. The prosecutions were more properly brought in the United States.

Furthermore, none of the policy reasons for taking a relativist approach to ill-treatment arising from life sentences could apply to ill-treatment arising from prison conditions. Detention at ADX was not mandated by United States law and the United States could give an undertaking not to detain the applicants there. Thus, the alternative to detention at ADX was not that they would be fugitives from United States justice, but rather that they would be detained in American prisons which were Article 3 compliant."

It also observes that the conclusions of the majority of the House of Lords in that case depended on three distinctions which, in their judgment, were to be found in this Court’s case-law. The first was between extradition cases and other cases of removal from the territory of a Contracting State; the second was between torture and other forms of ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3; and the third was between the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic context and the same assessment in the extra-territorial context.

For the first distinction, the Court considers that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The Court’s own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between extradition and other removals. For example, extradition requests may be withdrawn and the Contracting State may nonetheless decide to proceed with removal from its territory (see Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, § 14, 11 December 2008). Equally, a State may decide to remove someone who faces criminal proceedings (or has already been convicted) in another State in the absence of an extradition request (see, for example, Saadi v. Italy, cited above, and Bader and Kanbor v. Sweden, no. 13284/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Finally, there may be cases where someone has fled a State because he or she fears the implementation of a particular sentence that has already been passed upon him or her and is to be returned to that State, not under any extradition arrangement, but as a failed asylum seeker (see D. and Others v. Turkey, no. 24245/03, 22 June 2006). The Court considers that it would not be appropriate for one test to be applied to each of these three cases but a different test to be applied to a case in which an extradition request is made and complied with."

For the second distinction, between torture and other forms of ill-treatment, it is true that some support for this distinction and, in turn, the approach taken by the majority of the House of Lords in Wellington, can be found in the Soering judgment. The Court must therefore examine whether that approach has been borne out in its subsequent case-law."

It is correct that the Court has always distinguished between torture on the one hand and inhuman or degrading punishment on the other (see, for instance, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 167, Series A no. 25; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, §§ 95-106, ECHR 1999 ‑ V). However, the Court considers that this distinction is more easily drawn in the domestic context where, in examining complaints made under Article 3, the Court is called upon to evaluate or characterise acts which have already taken place. Where, as in the extra-territorial context, a prospective assessment is required, it is not always possible to determine whether the ill-treatment which may ensue in the receiving State will be sufficiently severe as to qualify as torture. Moreover, the distinction between torture and other forms of ill-treatment can be more easily drawn in cases where the risk of the ill-treatment stems from factors which do not engage either directly or indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities of the receiving State (see, for example, D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III, where the Court found that the proposed removal of a terminally ill man to St Kitts would be inhuman treatment and thus in violation of Article 3)."

For this reason, whenever the Court has found that a proposed removal would be in violation of Article 3 because of a real risk of ill-treatment which would be intentionally inflicted in the receiving State, it has normally refrained from considering whether the ill-treatment in question should be characterised as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. For example, in Chahal the Court did not distinguish between the various forms of ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3: at paragraph 79 of its judgment the Court stated that the “Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. In paragraph 80 the Court went on to state that:",

The Court now turns to whether a distinction can be drawn between the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic context and the same assessment in the extra-territorial context. The Court recalls its statement in Chahal, cited above, § 81 that it was not to be inferred from paragraph 89 of Soering that there was any room for balancing the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons for expulsion in determining whether a State’s responsibility under Article 3 was engaged. It also recalls that this statement was reaffirmed in Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 138, where the Court rejected the argument advanced by the United Kingdom Government that the risk of ill-treatment if a person is returned should be balanced against the danger he or she posed. In Saadi the Court also found that the concepts of risk and dangerousness did not lend themselves to a balancing test because they were “notions that [could] only be assessed independently of each other” (ibid. § 139). The Court finds that the same approach must be taken to the assessment of whether the minimum level of severity has been met for the purposes of Article 3: this too can only be assessed independently of the reasons for removal or extradition."

            [
                "173. The Court considers that its case-law since Soering confirms this approach. Even in extradition cases, such as where there has been an Article 3 complaint concerning the risk of life imprisonment without parole, the Court has focused on whether that risk was a real one, or whether it was alleviated by diplomatic and prosecutorial assurances given by the requesting State (see Olaechea Cahuas v. Spain, no. 24668/03, §§ 43 and 44, 10 August 2006; Youb Saoudi v. Spain (dec.), no. 22871/06, 18 September 2006; Salem v. Portugal (dec.), no. 26844/04, 9 May 2006; and Nivette v. France (dec.), no. 44190/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII). In those cases, the Court did not seek to determine whether the Article 3 threshold has been met with reference to the factors set out in paragraph 89 of the Soering judgment. By the same token, in cases where such assurances have not been given or have been found to be inadequate, the Court has not had recourse to the extradition context to determine whether there would be a violation of Article 3 if the surrender were to take place (see, for example, Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, §§ 66-75, 23 October 2008). Indeed in the twenty-two years since the Soering judgment, in an Article 3 case the Court has never undertaken an examination of the proportionality of a proposed extradition or other form of removal from a Contracting State. To this extent, the Court must be taken to have departed from the approach contemplated by paragraphs 89 and 110 of the Soering judgment."

Finally, the Court considers that, in interpreting Article 3, limited assistance can be derived from the approach taken by the Canadian Supreme Court in Burns and Ferras (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above). As the applicants have observed, those cases were about the provision of the Canadian Charter on fundamental justice and not the Charter’s prohibition on cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. Furthermore, the Charter system expressly provides for a balancing test in respect of both of those rights, which mirrors that found in Articles 8-11 of the Convention but not Article 3 (see paragraph 73 above)."

Instead, the Court considers that greater interpretative assistance can be derived from the approach the Human Rights Committee has taken to the prohibition on torture and ill-treatment contained in Article 7 of the ICCPR. The Committee’s General Comment No. 20 (see paragraph 76 above) makes clear that Article 7 prevents refoulement both when there is a real risk of torture and when there is a real risk of other forms of ill-treatment. Further, recent confirmation for the approach taken by the Court and by the Human Rights Committee can be found in Article 19 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which provides that no one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see paragraph 80 above). The wording of Article 19 makes clear that it applies without consideration of the extradition context and without distinction between torture and other forms of ill-treatment. In this respect, Article 19 of the Charter is fully consistent with the interpretation of Article 3 which the Court has set out above. It is also consistent with the Council of Europe Guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism, quoted at paragraph 79 above. Finally, the Court’s interpretation of Article 3, the Human Rights Committee’s interpretation of Article 7 of the ICCPR, and the text of Article 19 of the Charter are in accordance with Articles 3 and 16 § 2 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, particularly when the latter Article provides that the provisions of the Convention are “without prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion” (see paragraph 78 above)."

However, in reaching this conclusion, the Court would underline that it agrees with Lord Brown’s observation in Wellington that the absolute nature of Article 3 does not mean that any form of ill-treatment will act as a bar to removal from a Contracting State. As Lord Brown observed, this Court has repeatedly stated that the Convention does not purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention standards on other States (see, as a recent authority, Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 141, 7 July 2011). This being so, treatment which might violate Article 3 because of an act or omission of a Contracting State might not attain the minimum level of severity which is required for there to be a violation of Article 3 in an expulsion or extradition case. For example, a Contracting State’s negligence in providing appropriate medical care within its jurisdiction has, on occasion, led the Court to find a violation of Article 3 but such violations have not been so readily established in the extra-territorial context (compare the denial of prompt and appropriate medical treatment for HIV/AIDS in Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, §§ 145–158, 22 December 2008 with N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, 27 May 2008)."

Moreover, these decisions showed that the United States were both able and willing to protect the interests of ADX inmates, assess their claims and uphold them where appopriate. The Government also stated that, within the materials provided by the applicants, the Court could only properly place reliance on the decisions of the United States courts, rather than the untested statements of inmates at ADX or reports based upon them. Among these decisions, the Government placed particular emphasis on the conclusions reached by the Magistrate Judge in Rezaq (summarised at paragraph 112 above).

He also had weekly “open” visits with his family (sitting in a large hall without intervening glass screens). Even if he were to be convicted in the United Kingdom and classified as a High Risk Category A prisoner (which he was not) his conditions of detention would be less restricted and he would enjoy access to even more educational, religious, sport and recreational facilities than at present.

In the applicants’ submission, these faults in the Bureau’s procedures meant that the ADX regime did not comply with the procedural requirements for solitary confinement which the Court had laid down in Onoufriou v.

This might include something as minor as a disrespectful attitude to staff. As Professor Rovner had observed, despite the increase in the number of inmates admitted to the step down program, it remained a minority of inmates who progressed through it; significant numbers of inmates spent extremely long periods of time at ADX and, in the case of terrorist inmates, they could spent up to thirteen years in solitary confinement before being admitted to the program.

The yards were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with an opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. The Court considered that the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation (see Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 125, 9 October 2008). The Court examined the characteristics of outdoor exercise in Mandić and Jović v. Slovenia, nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, 20 October 2011. The Court found that the applicants’ situation (in overcrowded conditions) was further exacerbated by the fact that they were confined to their cell day and night, save for two hours of daily outdoor exercise, and an additional two hours per week in the recreation room. As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it was hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It was true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell.

In particular, the assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment. The feeling of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has (or will be) complied with. There are three particular elements to be considered in relation to the compatibility of an applicant’s health with his stay in detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an applicant (ibid. and Dybeku v.

Instead, it is clear from the declarations submitted by the Government, particularly that of Mr Milusnic, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons applies accessible and rational criteria when deciding whether to transfer an inmate to ADX. Placement is accompanied by a high degree of involvement of senior officials within the Bureau who are external to the inmate’s current institution. Their involvement and the requirement that a hearing be held before transfer provide an appropriate measure of procedural protection. There is no evidence to suggest that such a hearing is merely window dressing. Even if the transfer process were unsatisfactory, there would be recourse to both the Bureau’s administrative remedy programme and the federal courts, by bringing a claim under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to cure any defects in the process. Despite the third party interveners’ submission that recourse to the courts is difficult, the fact that Fourteenth Amendment cases have been brought by inmates at ADX shows that such difficulties can be overcome."

For the second complaint, ADX’s restrictive conditions, it is true that the present applicants are not physically dangerous and that, as the Court has observed at paragraph 211 above, it must be particularly attentive to any decision to place prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly in solitary confinement. However, as the applicants’ current detention in high security facilities in the United Kingdom demonstrates, the United States’ authorities would be justified in considering the applicants, if they are convicted, as posing a significant security risk and justifying strict limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world. There is nothing to indicate that the United States’ authorities would not continually review their assessment of the security risk which they considered the applicants to pose. As Ms Rangel has indicated, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has well-established procedures for reviewing an inmate’s security classification and carrying out reviews of that classification in six-monthly program reviews and three-yearly progress reports. Moreover, as the Department of Justice’s most recent letters show, the United States’ authorities have proved themselves willing to revise and to lift the special administrative measures which have been imposed on terrorist inmates thus enabling their transfer out of ADX to other, less restrictive institutions (see paragraph 97 above)."

This does not mean, however, that inmates are kept in complete sensory isolation or total social isolation. Although inmates are confined to their cells for the vast majority of the time, a great deal of in-cell stimulation is provided through television and radio channels, frequent newspapers, books, hobby and craft items and educational programming. The range of activities and services provided goes beyond what is provided in many prisons in Europe. Where there are limitations on the services provided, for example restrictions on group prayer, these are necessary and inevitable consequences of imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 68, ECHR 2007 ‑ V). The restrictions are, for the most part, reasonably related to the purported objectives of the ADX regime (cf. Csüllog, cited above, concerning unnecessary restrictions, such as a prohibition on tea-bags and books).",
                "The Court also observes that the services provided by ADX are supplemented by regular telephone calls and social visits and by the ability of inmates, even those under special administrative measures, to correspond with their families. The extent of those opportunities would be of considerable assistance to the applicants who would, by their extradition, be separated from their families in the United Kingdom.",
                "The Court finds that there are adequate opportunities for interaction between inmates. While inmates are in their cells talking to other inmates is possible, admittedly only through the ventilation system. During recreation periods inmates can communicate without impediment. Indeed, as Mr Milusnic indicates, most inmates spend their recreation periods talking (see his declaration at paragraph 85 above).",
                "In addition, although it is of some concern that outdoor recreation can be withdrawn for periods of three months for seemingly minor disciplinary infractions, the Court places greater emphasis on the fact that, according to Mr Milusnic, inmates’ recreation has only been cancelled once for security reasons and that the periods of recreation have been increased from five to ten hours per week.",

The Court would also note that, as it emphasised in Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 145, solitary confinement, even in cases entailing relative isolation, cannot be imposed indefinitely. If an applicant were at real risk of being detained indefinitely at ADX, then it would be possible for conditions to reach the minimum level of severity required for a violation of Article 3. Indeed, this may well be the case for those inmates who have spent significant periods of time at ADX. However, the figures provided by the United States’ authorities, although disputed by the applicants, show that there is a real possibility for the applicants to gain entry to the step down or special security unit programs. First, the Department of Justice’s letter of 26 September 2011 shows that while there were 252 inmates in ADX’s General Population Unit, 89 inmates were in the step down program. The figures provided in that letter for the special security unit program, when compared with the November 2010 figures given by Mr Milusnic, demonstrated that inmates are progressing through that program too. Second, Ms Rangel’s declarations show that inmates with convictions for international terrorism have entered the step down program and, in some cases, have completed it and been transferred to other institutions. Ms Rangel’s declaration is confirmed by the Rezaq et al v. Nalley et al judgment of the District Court where the petitioners, all convicted international terrorists, had brought proceedings to obtain entry to the step down program but, by the time the matter came to judgment, had completed the program and been transferred elsewhere (see paragraph 112 above)."

In the Government’s view, this was especially so when a discretionary life sentence by its very nature avoided the risk of arbitrariness of mandatory life sentences. Accordingly, given the serious nature of the allegations made against these applicants, and the full range of protections available in the United States (including the Eighth Amendment’s protection from grossly disproportionate sentences), there were no substantial grounds for believing that the imposition of discretionary life sentences would violate Article 3."

Under United States federal law a mandatory life sentence was reserved for a narrow category of offenders and the most serious criminal conduct. Given, therefore, that any mandatory life sentence (even if, for present purposes, it were irreducible) would only be imposed on the sixth applicant if he were convicted of participation in an act which had caused a massive loss of life, such a sentence would not be grossly disproportionate."

They relied on the views expressed by the House of Lords and Privy Council in Lichniak, Reyes, de Boucherville, as well as the rulings in Dodo, Philibert, and Tcoeib (see paragraphs 142, 149 and 151–154 above). They also relied on academic materials detailing the inhumane and degrading effects sentences of life imprisonment without parole had on prisoners, particularly in the United States.

As Ms Barrett’s evidence showed (see paragraph 133 above), United States trial judges had a limited sentencing discretion and the sentencing guidelines called for any offence involving terrorism to be punished by the available statutory maximum sentence. Therefore, it was highly likely that, where applicable, life sentences would be imposed. Moreover, it was not necessary for a life sentence to be mandatory for it to be disproportionate and thus in violation of Article 3. Several of the applicants risked life sentences for non-murder offences; in those circumstances, their sentences would be disproportionate because they could be imposed for non-murder offences without any real judicial discretion."

Second, compassionate release would only arise if they became terminally ill and, even then, the Bureau might not exercise its discretion in favour of release. In any event, hope of release to die of a terminal illness outside prison was not real hope of release. Third, release as a result of a change in the sentencing guidelines was speculative, did not automatically led to reductions, and would not apply if other, consecutive sentences were imposed.

Bieber and Wellington, cited above); an Article 3 issue could also arise at the time when the sentence was imposed.

Due regard must be had to the fact that sentencing practices vary greatly between States and that there will often be legitimate and reasonable differences between States as to the length of sentences which are imposed, even for similar offences.

For the second, a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the Court observes that normally such sentences are imposed for offences of the utmost severity, such as murder or manslaughter. In any legal system, such offences, if they do not attract a life sentence, will normally attract a substantial sentence of imprisonment, perhaps of several decades. Therefore, any defendant who is convicted of such an offence must expect to serve a significant number of years in prison before he can realistically have any hope of release, irrespective of whether he is given a life sentence or a determinate sentence. It follows, therefore, that, if a discretionary life sentence is imposed by a court after due consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, an Article 3 issue cannot arise at the moment when it is imposed. Instead, the Court agrees with the Court of Appeal in Bieber and the House of Lords in Wellington that an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: (i) that the applicant’s continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation); and (ii) as the Grand Chamber stated in Kafkaris, cited above, the sentence is irreducible de facto and de iure."

This is no truer than for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a sentence which, in effect, condemns a defendant to spend the rest of his days in prison, irrespective of his level of culpability and irrespective of whether the sentencing court considers the sentence to be justified.",

Instead, these considerations mean that such a sentence is much more likely to be grossly disproportionate than any of the other types of life sentence, especially if it requires the sentencing court to disregard mitigating factors which are generally understood as indicating a significantly lower level of culpability on the part of the defendant, such as youth or severe mental health problems (see, for instance, Hussain v. the United Kingdom and Prem Singh v. the United Kingdom, judgments of 21 February 1996, Reports 1996-I at paragraphs 53 and 61 respectively and the Canadian case of Burns, at paragraph 93, quoted at paragraph 74 above).",

Given that none of these applicants has been convicted, still less has begun serving any sentences which might be imposed upon conviction (cf. Kafkaris and Léger, cited above, and Iorgov v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 36295/02, 2 September 2010), the Court considers that they have not shown that, upon extradition, their incarceration in the United States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Indeed, if they are convicted and given discretionary life sentences, it may well be that, as the Government have submitted, the point at which continued incarceration would no longer serve any purpose may never arise. It is still less certain that, if that point were ever reached, the United States’ authorities would refuse to avail themselves of the mechanisms which are available to reduce their sentences (see paragraph 130 above and Kafkaris, cited above, § 98).",

Indeed, if he is convicted of these charges, it is difficult to conceive of any mitigating factors which would lead a court to impose a lesser sentence than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, even if it had the discretion to do so.

                "In respect of the former, the Court notes that the first and third applicants complained that the imposition of special administrative measures pre-trial would have an adverse effect on their mental health. Insofar as they related to their possible conditions of pre-trial detention, the Court rejected those complaints as manifestly ill-founded. It found that it had not been suggested that, prior to extradition, the United Kingdom authorities would not advise their United States counterparts of the applicants’ mental health conditions or that, upon extradition, the United States’ authorities would fail to provide appropriate psychiatric care to them. The Court also noted that it had not been argued that psychiatric care in United States federal prisons was substantially different to that provided at HMP Long Lartin (where the first and third applicants were being detained). There was also no reason to suggest that the United States’ authorities would ignore any changes in the applicants’ conditions or that, if they did present any suicidal tendencies or symptoms of self-harm, they would refuse to alter the conditions of their detention to alleviate any risk to them.",
                "The Court finds that similar considerations must apply in respect of the fifth applicant’s complaint concerning his pre-trial detention. Accordingly, insofar as it relates to the risk of suicide before his trial would take place, the complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded. Insofar as the complaint relates to the risk of suicide in post-trial detention at ADX Florence, the Court finds that no separate issue arises from the Article 3 complaint considered above."

                "250. The Court turns to the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth complaints, which relate, respectively, to the imposition of special administrative measures pre-trial, the prejudicial effect of extensive pre-trial publicity, the prejudice arising from inducements or pressure placed on Mr Al-Fadl to testify against them, and the further prejudicial effect of the sixth applicant’s designation as a global terrorist. The Court notes that similar complaints were made by the first, third and fourth applicants and rejected in the admissibility decision (paragraphs 125-135, 159-160, 163 and 166). There are no grounds to distinguish the fifth and sixth applicants’ complaints under these headings and, accordingly, these complaints must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded."

                "251. As regards the sixth complaint, that the evidence had significantly weakened against the fifth and sixth applicants, the Court recalls that it is not its task to assess the evidence against an accused, still less, in an extradition case, to evaluate the strength of the requesting State’s case against an applicant. This complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded."

                "252. For the ninth complaint, that extradition would be a disproportionate inference with their family and private life in the United Kingdom, the Court reiterates that it will only be in exceptional circumstances that an applicant’s private or family life in a Contracting State will outweigh the legitimate aim pursued by his or her extradition (see King v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 9742/07, 26 January 2010). There are no such exceptional circumstances in the fifth and sixth applicants’ case, particularly given the gravity of the offences with which they are charged. This complaint is therefore manifestly ill founded."

                "255. The Court notes that the second applicant has made similar submissions under Article 3 as to the length of his likely sentence and conditions at ADX Florence. For the latter, he has relied in particular on the fact that his schizophrenia necessitated his transfer from high security conditions at HMP Long Lartin to Broadmoor Hospital. There he has significant freedom within the security of the hospital and has participated in group activities as therapeutic measures. He is under the care of a consultant psychiatrist, who considers it necessary to continue his compulsory hospitalisation."

The Court considers that it is not in a position to rule on the merits of the second applicant’s complaints, particularly in respect of ADX Florence, but requires further submissions from the parties. For that reason, it decides to adjourn the examination of the second applicant’s complaints. Those complaints will now be considered under a new application number, no. 17299/12."
