The Court reiterates in this connection that the enforcement of a sentence imposed in the context of the right to life must be regarded as an integral part of the State’s procedural obligation under Article 2 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kitanovska Stanojkovic and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 2319/14, §§ 32-33, 13 October 2016). It therefore considers that, regardless of where the crimes were committed, in so far as Azerbaijan agreed to and assumed the obligation under the Transfer Convention to continue the enforcement of R.S.’s prison sentence commenced by the Hungarian authorities (see paragraph 48 above), it was bound to do so, in compliance with its procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Aliyeva and Aliyev, cited above, § 56)."

As for the Armenian participants in the language course, R.S. said they had provoked and mocked him and the Azerbaijani flag on several occasions, which was why he had decided to buy an axe and kill them on the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region (for general background information, see Chiragov and Others v.

The first-instance court considered all four psychiatric reports and gave detailed reasons for accepting the conclusions of two of them.

Of course, the act committed by R.S. has never been approved by the authorities of Azerbaijan, for that act he was arrested by the Hungarian court, and we believe that this corresponds to committed act. But there is one question that Azerbaijani society has discussed for several years.... At that time, the Hungarian court treated R.S. too cruelly, and imposed an inadequate punishment on him, under heavy pressure from Armenians, including the pressure of the representatives of some pro-Armenian diaspora, and foreign organizations... For a crime committed by R.S., European countries, Azerbaijan, and Armenia itself and others impose a punishment of fifteen years, and after serving half the sentence, a prisoner, falling under an amnesty for good behaviour, is released. Therefore punishment passed by Hungarian court for eight and a half years has continuously been assessed by Azerbaijani people as inadequate decision... The result is obvious, and today, after eight and a half years of serving the sentence, the Azerbaijani society regards R.S.’ release as a just act. In fact, the President of Azerbaijan pardoned R.S. using both the opinion formed during that time, and possibility, created by the Azerbaijani law as well...

There ICJ drew a clear distinction between the legal situation immediately following the seizure of the United States embassy and its personnel by the militants, and that created by a decree of the Iranian State which expressly approved and maintained the situation.",
                "‘ The policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages for the purpose of exerting pressure on the United States Government was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation created by the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages. The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuing occupation of the Embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of that State.’",
                "(5) As regards State practice, the capture and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann may provide an example of the subsequent adoption of private conduct by a State. On 10 May 1960, Eichmann was captured by a group of Israelis in Buenos Aires. He was held in captivity in Buenos Aires in a private home for some weeks before being taken by air to Israel. Argentina later charged the Israeli Government with complicity in Eichmann’s capture, a charge neither admitted nor denied by Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, during the discussion in the Security Council of the complaint. She referred to Eichmann’s captors as a ‘volunteer group’. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina. It may be that Eichmann’s captors were ‘in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Israel, in which case their conduct was more properly attributed to the State under article 8. But where there are doubts about whether certain conduct falls within article 8, these may be resolved by the subsequent adoption of the conduct in question by the State.",
                "(6) The phrase ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’ is intended to distinguish cases of acknowledgement and adoption from cases of mere support or endorsement. ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case used phrases such as ‘approval’, ‘endorsement’, ‘the seal of official governmental approval’ and ‘the decision to perpetuate [the situation]’. These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to ‘approval’ or ‘endorsement’ of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of ‘adoption’, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State’s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term ‘acknowledges and adopts’ in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",
                "(8) The phrase ‘if and to the extent that’ is intended to convey a number of ideas. First, the conduct of, in particular, private persons, groups or entities is not attributable to the State unless under some other article of chapter II or unless it has been acknowledged and adopted by the State. Secondly, a State might acknowledge and adopt conduct only to a certain extent. In other words, a State may elect to acknowledge and adopt only some of the conduct in question. Thirdly, the act of acknowledgment and adoption, whether it takes the form of words or conduct, must be clear and unequivocal.",
                "(9) The conditions of acknowledgement and adoption are cumulative, as indicated by the word ‘and’. The order of the two conditions indicates the normal sequence of events in cases in which article 11 is relied on. Acknowledgement and adoption of conduct by a State might be express (as for example in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case), or it might be inferred from the conduct of the State in question.”"

Finally, the Court observes that none of the situations, other than those referred to in Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, in which specific conduct may be attributed to a State, matches the circumstances of the present case in regard to the possibility of attributing the genocide at Srebrenica to the Respondent. The Court does not see itself required to decide at this stage whether the ILC’s Articles dealing with attribution, apart from Articles 4 and 8, express present customary international law, it being clear that none of them apply in this case. The acts constituting genocide were not committed by persons or entities which, while not being organs of the FRY, were empowered by it to exercise elements of the governmental authority (Art. 5), nor by organs placed at the Respondent’s disposal by another State (Art. 6), nor by persons in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities of the Respondent (Art. 9); finally, the Respondent has not acknowledged and adopted the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts of genocide as its own (Art. 11).",

In determining the question as to whether the illegal conduct of the individuals can somehow be attributed to SFOR, the Trial Chamber refers to the principles laid down in the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’) on the issue of ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’. These Draft Articles were adopted by the ILC at its fifty-third session in 2001. The Trial Chamber is however aware of the fact that any use of this source should be made with caution. The Draft Articles were prepared by the International Law Commission and are still subject to debate amongst States. They do not have the status of treaty law and are not binding on States. Furthermore, as can be deduced from its title, the Draft Articles are primarily directed at the responsibilities of States and not at those of international organisations or entities.

                "61. In the present context, the focus should first be on the possible attribution of the acts of the unknown individuals to SFOR. As indicated in Article I of Annex 1-A to the Dayton Agreement, IFOR (SFOR) is a multinational military force. It ‘may be composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations’ and ‘will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council.’ For the purposes of deciding upon the motions pending in the present case, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to determine the exact legal status of SFOR under international law. Purely as general legal guidance, it will use the principles laid down in the Draft Articles insofar as they may be helpful for determining the issue at hand.",
                "64. The Trial Chamber observes that both Parties use the same and similar criteria of ‘acknowledgement’, ‘adoption’, ‘recognition’, ‘approval’ and ‘ratification’, as used by the ILC. The question is therefore whether on the basis of the assumed facts SFOR can be considered to have ‘acknowledged and adopted’ the conduct undertaken by the individuals ‘as its own’. It needs to be re-emphasised in this context that it cannot be deduced from the assumed facts that SFOR was in any way, directly or indirectly, involved in the actual apprehension of the accused in the FRY or in the transfer of the accused into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts. What can be concluded from the assumed facts is merely that the Accused was handed over to an SFOR unit after having been arrested in the FRY by unknown individuals and brought into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the perspective of SFOR, the Accused had come into contact with SFOR in the execution of their assigned task. In accordance with their mandate and in light of Article 29 of the Statute and Rule 59 bis, they were obliged to inform the Prosecution and to hand him over to its representatives. From these facts, the Trial Chamber can readily conclude that there was no collusion or official involvement by SFOR in the alleged illegal acts.”"

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘special features’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44.

Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, § 55).

That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision.

In this context, the Court also notes the particularly disturbing statements submitted by the applicants concerning R.S. that had been given by various political and other public figures during the material timeframe (see paragraph 25 above), the majority of which indicated personal approval on the part of various Azerbaijani officials and other persons of R.S.’s conduct or his transfer and pardon. The applicants argued that such glorifying statements – including those contained in the special section dedicated to R.S. on the official webpage of the President of Azerbaijan (see paragraph 25 above) – amounted to Azerbaijan’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s crimes as its own. The Court agrees that many of the statements in question are particularly disturbing in that they glorify R.S. as a national hero for the gruesome crimes that he committed."

In sum, the Court considers it clear that, viewing the actions of the Azerbaijani Government as a whole, including the decision to pardon R.S. and then to promote him to the rank of major during the course of a public ceremony and to award him eight years of salary arrears and the use of a flat (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above), Azerbaijan must be considered to have demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s conduct."
            ],
            [
                "118. The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

                "119. Lastly, the applicants claimed that Azerbaijan had failed to properly regulate military service requirements and in particular had failed to establish R.S.’s mental state prior to sending him into an environment in which he would inevitably be called upon to interact with representatives of the Armenian military. Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

Turkey, no. 42942/02, § 61, 8 April 2008). The applicants emphasised that the issues of deterrence and the prevention and suppression of offences were inextricably linked to the question of punishment, all of which were highly relevant to the case, given its very high profile, both nationally and internationally. Such a profile meant that the Azerbaijani authorities’ failure to act in an appropriate way to ensure that others were deterred from committing similar offences had magnified the effects of the case.

In that case the Commission had held that “the failure of an individual criminal to serve an adequate term may give rise to an international liability even where the original sentence is adequate.” Thus, in certain circumstances pardons and amnesties had been considered a form of denial of justice under international law."

The applicants submitted that the basis of the pardon was the Azerbaijani authorities’ scepticism of, or at the very least their ambivalence towards, the conviction and sentence of R.S. handed down by the Hungarian court.

The effect of the exercise of the President’s discretion to issue a pardon had therefore been “to lessen the consequences of a serious criminal act ... rather than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated” (see Ali and Ayşe Duran, cited above, § 68). Rather than being promoted and receiving other benefits, R.S. should have been dismissed from the military (see Abdülsamet Yaman, cited above, § 55).

Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, any interpretation of the Transfer Convention “in good faith” and “in the light of its object and purpose” could only lead to the conclusion that it had been breached by the actions of the Azerbaijani Government in the case.

On the contrary, States are to be all the more stringent when punishing their own agents for the commission of serious life-endangering crimes than they are with ordinary offenders, because what is at stake is not only the issue of the individual criminal-law liability of the perpetrators but also the State’s duty to combat the sense of impunity the offenders may consider themselves to enjoy by virtue of their very office (see, mutatis mutandis, Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 274).",

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that a large portion of the procedural obligation to effectively investigate loss of life in the present case – namely the criminal investigation and R.S.’s conviction – was carried out by Hungary. Having served over eight years of his prison term there, R.S. was transferred to Azerbaijan in order to continue serving his prison sentence in his home country. However, upon his return, R.S. was released on the basis of a pardon by the Azerbaijani President. This was followed by granting him a flat in Baku, salary arrears for the time he spent in prison in Hungary as well a promotion in military rank at a public ceremony (see paragraph 21 above) and accompanied by strong support and approval from a number of Azerbaijani public figures and high ranking officials (see paragraph 25 above)."

Indeed, pursuant to the preamble to the Transfer Convention, its main aims are to promote justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons. Moreover, in its 2014 resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly concluded that, by granting R.S. a pardon, Azerbaijan had violated the principle of good faith and the rule of law (see paragraph 41 above).

In the Court’s opinion, in view of the extremely tense political situation between the two countries, the authorities should have been all the more cautious, given that the victims of the crimes in the present case were of Armenian origin (see in this sense the European Parliament’s resolution cited at paragraph 42 above)."

First of all, in the absence of any proof other than an affidavit lodged by R.S.’s defence lawyer (see paragraph 13 above), it is difficult to seriously question the fairness of criminal proceedings conducted in another Council of Europe Member State. Indeed, R.S. was afforded a criminal trial in Hungary before courts at two judicial instances, which delivered well-reasoned decisions. In particular, the Hungarian courts explained that R.S. himself had initially asked for an interpreter from Hungarian into Russian and that – once he had complained about not understanding that language to the necessary degree – they had conducted an in-depth analysis of the disadvantage at which this may have put him in the proceedings against him. In the end, they concluded that it was proven that R.S. had a good command of Russian and that, in any event, at his request he had subsequently been provided with interpreters and translations of documents into his native language (see paragraph 15 above)."

In any event, there is insufficient evidence that any procedural omission – if indeed there had been one – was not subsequently offset by procedural safeguards or that such an omission rendered the entire proceedings against him unfair (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 262, ECHR 2016). In any event, had R.S. considered his trial unfair, he could have lodged an application under Article 6 with the Court against Hungary once the criminal proceedings against him had come to an end, but he failed to do so."

In particular, the Court is satisfied that R.S.’s mental capacities had been thoroughly assessed during his trial in Hungary by a number of medical experts and that he was found to have been mentally able to understand the dangers and consequences of his actions at the time of the offences (see paragraph 15 above). The subsequent decision by the Azerbaijani authorities to promote R.S. to a higher military rank would clearly suggest that he was deemed fit to continue to serve in the military and therefore did not suffer from a serious mental condition."

The Azerbaijani Government did not provide any explanation as to why R.S. had been granted those benefits, nor did they indicate the legal basis for such actions apart from citing the applicable regulation on military promotion (see paragraph 30 above).

While there was nothing under Article 12 of the Transfer Convention to suggest that the receiving State should seek the consent of the sentencing State before a pardon or an amnesty was granted, the applicants referred to the declaration of January 2001 that Azerbaijan submitted at the ratification of the Transfer Convention and argued that, according to the International Law Commission’s Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties and under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and judicial practice, that declaration in fact constituted a reservation and that the relevant legal consequences therefore applied. Under Articles 21 and 23 of the Vienna Convention, a reservation established with regard to another party modified those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the State expressing the reservation question, and any claim to the contrary would run against the fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States. Azerbaijan could not, therefore, avoid the legal effects of its own reservation. Its decision regarding the pardon of R.S. should have been agreed with the competent authorities of Hungary. If the Court accepted that the declaration of Azerbaijan constituted an interpretative declaration and not a reservation, it would show the understanding of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be that the correct interpretation of Article 12 implied that the consent of the sentencing State must be sought. Azerbaijan had not acted in good faith."

The applicants referred in particular to Articles 5 and 6 and argued that, following the transfer of R.S. to Azerbaijan, Hungary’s jurisdiction had been substituted for that of Azerbaijan’s as regards the need for effective protection and remedies and the enforcement of the punishment. The pardoning of R.S. had failed to ensure an appropriate punishment for a crime motivated by the ethnic origin of the victims."

It could not be established that the ethnic origin of the victims had been the sole motive for R.S.’s actions. He had been motivated by a number of factors and his motivation should be seen in the light of the provocations he had been exposed to by the Armenian officers and of his personal history. The Azerbaijani Government reiterated that they strongly denied having acknowledged or accepted R.S.’s conduct as their own. Azerbaijan did not approve of the crimes and it accepted that R.S. had been properly convicted. Azerbaijan’s dissatisfaction emanated from the length of his sentence, given all the circumstances."

Discrimination is treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in relevantly similar situations (see Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, § 48, ECHR 2002-IV). Discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person’s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person’s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures (see Timishev, cited above, § 58)."

Proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova, cited above, § 147)."

In certain circumstances, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation on how the events in question occurred (see Al Nashiri v. Romania, no. 33234/12, §§ 492-493, 31 May 2018, and the cases cited therein). Finally, having recognised that proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice (see, among many other authorities, Mižigárová v. Slovakia, no. 74832/01, § 120, 14 December 2010), the Court did not rule out requiring a respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination in certain cases of alleged discrimination and, if they fail to do so, find a violation of Article 14 of the Convention on that basis (see Nachova, cited above, § 157; Stoica v.

At the outset, the Court observes that the Hungarian courts convicted R.S. of committing an exceptionally cruel murder and of making preparations for another murder; moreover, the sole motive for those crimes was the Armenian nationality of his victims (see paragraph 15 above). The ethnic bias in respect of R.S.’s crimes was thus fully investigated and highlighted by the Hungarian courts, and the Court sees no reasons to question those conclusions. Nor did the applicants in the present case complain of a failure to investigate racist motives for R.S.’s crimes. In fact, the applicants submitted under Article 14 of the Convention that the Armenian ethnic origin of the victims had not only been the main reason for the said crimes, but also for the various subsequent actions of the Azerbaijani authorities, including the pardoning and glorification of the perpetrator. In that respect, the applicants’ discrimination complaint differs significantly from complaints typically raised under the procedural limb of Articles 2 or 3 in other cases concerning discriminatory violence (compare with, among many other authorities, Lakatošová and Lakatoš v. Slovakia, no. 655/16, § 65, 11 December 2018; Ciorcan and Others v. Romania, nos. 29414/09 and 44841/09, § 152, 27 January 2015; and Angelova and Iliev, cited above, § 107)."

Faced with the applicants’ complaint of a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2, as formulated, the Court’s task is to establish whether or not the Armenian ethnic origin of R.S.’s victims and the nature of his crimes played a role in the measures taken by the Azerbaijani authorities following his return to Azerbaijan."

Firstly, R.S. was pardoned immediately upon his return to Azerbaijan; there is nothing in the case file to indicate that a formal request to this end was ever made, and nor is there any indication that there ensued any kind of reflection process or legal procedure for the pardon (see paragraph 29 above). Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons – see paragraph 28 above). As already stated, the Government did not indicate a domestic legal basis for all of those additional measures (see paragraph 169 above), which were understandably perceived as constituting rewards for R.S.’s actions (see paragraph 172 above). Nor have they provided any past examples of other convicted murderers who received analogous benefits upon their release following a presidential pardon."

It also deplores the fact that a large majority of those statements expressed particular support for the fact that R.S.’s crimes had been directed against Armenian soldiers, congratulated him on his actions and called him a patriot, a role model and a hero."

The applicants also drew the Court’s attention to the fact that a special page on the website of the President of Azerbaijan had been created, labelled “Letters of Appreciation regarding [R.S.]”, where individuals could express their congratulations on his release and pardon (see paragraph 102 above). A vast number of those letters were still viewable on that webpage, all of them thanking the President for pardoning R.S. on the basis that they agreed with his having killed his Armenian victim. While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.’s actions."

In the light of the above, and bearing in mind that the present case concerns one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the Convention, the Court is satisfied that the applicants have put forward sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences as to make a convincing prima facie case that the measures taken by the Azerbaijani authorities in respect of R.S. were racially motivated. The Court is mindful of the difficulty faced by the applicants in proving such bias beyond a reasonable doubt, given that the facts in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the Azerbaijani authorities. The Court considers that, given the particular circumstances of the present case, it was therefore incumbent on the respondent Government to disprove the arguable discrimination allegation made by the applicants (see paragraph 212 above)."

In the Court’s view, the two statements provided by the Azerbaijani Government are therefore not sufficient to refute the overwhelming body of evidence submitted by the applicants indicating that the various measures leading to R.S.’s virtual impunity, coupled with the glorification of his extremely cruel hate crime, had a causal link to the Armenian ethnicity of his victims."

There had been frequent fires in the machinery section of the ship during the voyage by the Vega. When fires broke out, there was a strong smell of fumes. When there was a fire in the machinery section, the air conditioning in the ship ’ s cabins did not work, and the temperature would rise as high as 50 ˚C.

However, according to the SLI, V.B. ’ s duties did not include repairs to the main engine or extinguishing fires, and he had not done such jobs.

The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert, V. A. during the hearing in April 200 8 before the Klaipėda Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 49 below). On the basis of V.B. ’ s medical record of 15 June 2001 that expert had testified that V.B. had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract. If the nerve did not work properly, heart arrhythmia could occur, which could in turn cause a heart attack. The position of V.B. ’ s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack. According to that expert, fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space, and there had been a lack of oxygen. However, a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation. Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take a day or week to happen.",

The applicant was also dissatisfied that the SLI had not inspected the Vega itself, nor had it questioned the crew members, who could have confirmed the unsafe working conditions on board. There had also been no autopsy, nor any test for toxins in her husband ’ s skin or hair. The body had been embalmed too quickly, without such examinations. The applicant further submitted that Lithuanian diplomats had not been present when the body had been embalmed. The applicant also pointed out that her husband had been healthy: he had been examined by a doctors ’ commission in April 2007 and that that conclusion was valid for one year; moreover, her husband had not complained about any heart issue.

She had also asked for documents confirming whether it had been verified that V.B. could have died of poisoning by combustion gases; for the questioning of doctor V.G. , who had signed the conclusion of the doctors ’ commission ( of April 200 7 ) as to V.B. ’ s health; and for other investigative actions. Given that the applicant had had the status of a victim, the prosecutor had been under an obligation to take a decision on those requests.

Having examined the pre-trial investigation material, the regional court concluded that the kind of breaches alleged by the applicant had not been properly examined during the criminal investigation. Furthermore, as could be seen from the SLI ’ s report of 27 March 2008, the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either (see paragraph 1 7 above). Accordingly, it could not be stated that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death had been performed thoroughly. In the opinion of the Klaipėda Regional Court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of V.B. ’ s body, and to establish whether V.B. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. Should breaches of working conditions be established, it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on V.B. ’ s death.

The Code also stipulated that an investigating officer or prosecutor had the right to order individuals or legal entities to provide objects or documents of relevance to a criminal investigation (Article 97). The victim of a crime could ask the prosecutor in writing to perform certain investigative actions and the prosecutor had to examine such a request.

The Law on Maritime Shipping ( Prekybinės laivybos įstatymas ) at the relevant time provided that legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania were applicable to the ships registered in the Republic of Lithuania and located outside the boundaries of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, to the extent that they did not contradict the legislation of the State in whose territory the ships in question were located or unless this Law provided otherwise. The right of ownership of a ship sailing outside the territorial boundaries of the Republic of Lithuania was to be determined based on the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. The legal status of the ship ’ s crew was to be determined by the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. Relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain were to be determined by the legal acts of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under, unless an agreement regulating such relations provided otherwise. The provisions of civil, administrative, labour and other laws of the Republic of Lithuania applied accordingly to civil and administrative relations and those related to work on board ships and other legal relations arising from maritime shipping and not falling within the sphere of regulation of the Law in question (Article 5 §§ 1, 4, 5 and 17). The right to sail under the State flag of Lithuania was to be granted to ships which were entered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania (Article 7). A ship was to be registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania if its owner was a Lithuanian citizen or legal entity registered in Lithuania (Article 8). A ship registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailing under a Lithuanian flag was considered to be a subject of the Republic of Lithuania ( laivas, įregistruotas Lietuvos Respublikos jūrų laivų registre ir plaukiojantis su Lietuvos valstybės vėliava, turi Lietuvos Respublikos nacionalinę priklausomybę ) (Article 9).",

The members of the crew and passengers had unconditionally to obey the captain. The captain was to be responsible for the safety of the ship, crew, passengers and cargo. The captain acted based on the laws and other legal statutes of the Republic of Lithuania and supervised compliance with such laws on board the ship. If a criminal act was committed on board a ship while it was at sea, the captain of the ship was to perform the functions of the authorities responsible for the preliminary investigation. Disciplinary, administrative, criminal or civil action was to be taken against a captain for failure to perform the obligations specified in the Law (Article 13 § § 1, 2, 4, 14 ).",

The applicant also pointed out that although the fact of death had been brought to the Lithuanian authorities ’ attention as early as in autumn 2007, the experts had been ordered to establish the cause of death only in spring 2010. There had also been unjustified delays in preparing a request to the Brazilian authorities for legal assistance.

The length of the pre-trial investigation had been caused by the complexity and scope of the case, which had demanded many investigative acts, some of which had been extremely time-consuming. The investigators had had to question a large number of witnesses, who had also worked at sea for long periods. Contrary to the applicant ’ s submission, the shipping company had provided investigators with all the available documentation from the Vega, except for certain materials which had been destroyed by the company due to the sale of the ship. As to the request for legal assistance, there had been objective reasons for it taking several months to send it out after it had been prepared. Firstly, because of the specific rules on asking for legal assistance, and, secondly, because of the need to translate the documents into Portuguese, when there were few competent translators for such work in Lithuania. In addition, the investigators had also relied on the findings of the domestic administrative courts, which had separately looked at the issue of whether the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death could be recognised as a workplace accident. In the view of the Government, if the administrative courts had had any doubts about V.B. ’ s death being due to natural causes, then those courts would have stayed proceedings until the criminal case, pending at the time of the administrative court proceedings, had been decided."

The respondent Government have not argued that the investigation into the death of the applicant ’ s husband did not attract Lithuania ’ s responsibility because he died when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’ (see paragraph 19 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § § 243-247, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 159, 9 April 2009). However, it would emphasise that this obligation may differ, both in content and in terms of its underlying rationale, depending on the particular situation that has triggered it (see Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, § 51, ECHR 2002-I, and Banks and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 21387/05, 6 February 2007). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility ( see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002-IV)."

In as much as different considerations apply in cases such as the present one, in which the death has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action, the standard against which the investigation ’ s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting. However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness ( see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 73, 21 December 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In that regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Emars v. Latvia, no. 22412/08, § 76, 1 8 November 2014; Mulini v. Bulgaria, no. 2092/08, § 42, 20 October 2015 ), and that Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, §§ 94 and 96, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, § 51, 8 December 2015 ). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard (see Olszewscy v. Poland, no. 99/12, § 68, 3 November 2015 ). Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see Rantsev, cited above, § 232).",

                "68. The Court acknowledges at the outset that there was no evidence that V.B. died as a result of the use of force. However, as noted above (see paragraph 6 7 above ), this does not preclude the existence of an obligation to investigate his death under Article 2. In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding V.B. ’ s death and the allegations of fires and leaks of gases on the Vega in the period leading up to his death, the Court observes that a procedural obligation of effective criminal inquiry did arise in respect of the Lithuanian authorities to investigate the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 5 1 and 5 2 above). By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate circumstance of V.B. ’ s heart attack but also the broader context of V.B. ’ s working conditions on the Vega, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of hazardous working conditions and V.B. ’ s death."
            ],
            [
                "69. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, the Court does not attach particular weight to the fact that the circumstances of the applicant ’ s work on the Vega, and the possible causes of his death, were examined in two separate sets of court proceedings – criminal and administrative. It is true that the administrative proceedings dealt with the question of whether the death of the applicant ’ s husband could be considered as a work accident. Those proceedings terminated with the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s conclusion of 5 February 2009, dispelling the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 50 above). That being so, for the Court it is sufficient to note that on 20 March 2009, when the administrative court proceedings were already over, the Klaipėda Regional Court held that the criminal investigation as to the true cause of V.B. ’ s death had not been thorough. In fact, to dispel any remaining doubts, the prosecutor was ordered to continue the pre-trial investigation, and a number of investigative measures were conducted afterwards (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above)."
            ],
            [
                "70. As to the adequacy of the criminal investigation, the Court accepts that the ship ’ s captain and other members of its crew examined the scene and that photographs were taken. The following day, the Brazilian police took statements from the captain and the chief engineer (see paragraph 7 above). Aside from those actions, as the applicant rightly noted to the Lithuanian criminal court (see paragraph 2 1 above), her husband ’ s body was quickly embalmed the same day without her being asked whether she wished any further investigative actions to be taken. As a result, the experts could subsequently only discuss hypothetical possible causes for V.B. ’ s death, given that the lack of an autopsy prevented them from stating with certainty that he had died of a heart attack (see paragraphs 40-42 above). On this point the Court also notes that the ship ’ s captain performs the role of an investigative officer if a criminal act takes place on his ship (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst acknowledging that it was mostly not within the captain ’ s competence to decide what investigative measures the Brazilian authorities should have undertaken before embalming the body, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a heart attack as the cause of death was opportune in the face of the overall suspicions of hazardous work conditions on that ship. That being so, and whilst any possible failure to undertake investigative measures on 24 or 25 October 2007 on Brazilian territory is mostly not down to the Lithuanian ship ’ s captain and thus not down to the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph 53 above), it also transpires from the facts of the case that there were numerous deficiencies once the investigation into the circumstances of the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death was conducted in Lithuania."

            [
                "71. Turning to the criminal investigation, the Court firstly shares the applicant ’ s view, also confirmed by the Klaipėda Regional Court, that on 29 December 2007 the Lithuanian prosecutor acted hastily in discontinuing the criminal proceedings, essentially relying only on what by then appears to have been a fairly limited amount of evidence, and quickly accepting the fact that V.B. had died of heart attack, as had been indicated in V.B. ’ s Brazilian death certificate (see paragraphs 1 3 and 1 4 above)."
            ],
            [
                "72. The Court also observes that after the criminal case had been returned for further investigation, in 2009 the Klaipėda Seaport Police eventually asked the SLI to provide information on whether the Vega had been inspected. It is particularly striking to note the SLI ’ s answer that they had not inspected the ship after V.B. ’ s death, which had taken place nearly two years before (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Although the applicant strongly believed that her husband had not died of natural causes, but had been a victim of poisoning by combustion gases, and abundant evidence about those gases and fires on the ship had been brought to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities as early as in spring 2008 (see paragraphs 1 5-17 above ), the Lithuanian authorities made no effort to instruct the Limarko company to bring the ship back to Lithuania, where it could be properly examined, whereas Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to grant the prosecutor exactly that right (see paragraph 5 2 above). In that connection, the Court further notes that documents and medical experts have established, on the one hand, that the applicant ’ s husband was healthy, and that there were no obstacles to him serving on board a ship; on the other hand, those experts also concluded that in the absence of documents about the gases it was not possible to say that those gases were not the cause of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 19 in fine, 30 and 40 above)."
            ],
            [
                "73. The Court further observes that on 10 September 2008 the applicant submitted a written request to the prosecutor to take particular actions to find out about the working conditions on the Vega at the material time. The prosecutor ignored her requests, which was recognised by the Klaipėda City District Court (see paragraph 2 2 above). Furthermore, although the applicant had as early as July 2009 alerted the prosecutor to the fact that Limarko intended to sell the Vega, and had asked the prosecutor to make sure that relevant documents would not be lost, her request again did not receive a timely response from the Lithuanian authorities. As a result, when half a year later the Klaipėda Seaport Police finally asked Limarko to submit documents regarding the Vega ’ s machinery section, the company confirmed that the ship had been sold to a third party, and the relevant logbooks had been destroyed (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 above). That being so, the Court finds that the Lithuanian authorities failed to secure all the relevant evidence, given the value of such evidence in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. The Court also considers that even if the applicant had been granted victim status at the beginning of the criminal investigation, her participation appears to have been limited to being able only to gain access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 12, 20 and 32 above). Accordingly, the Lithuanian authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite her constant and strenuous efforts to remain involved."

It cannot but note that it took the Lithuanian authorities some eight months to prepare and send such a request to the Brazilian authorities (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). In any case, given that the request was sent more than three years after the death and after the opening of the pre-trial investigation, it is not astounding that no relevant information was received from the Brazilian authorities (see paragraph 38 above). That notwithstanding, the Court cannot but hold that the Lithuanian prosecutors once again simply accepted the lack of information as a fact, without considering whether it was necessary, for example, to submit another request for legal assistance to their Brazilian colleagues (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev, cited above, § 241). In this context the Court also is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument about difficulties in finding a translator from Portuguese language in Lithuania."

Many people in distress at sea have been rescued and many attempting to reach Europe have been pushed back, but the list of fatal incidents – as predictable as they are tragic – is a long one and it is currently getting longer on an almost daily basis.",

In that letter, the Vice-President of the European Commission expressed himself as follows:",
                "“According to information available to the Commission, the migrants concerned were intercepted on the high seas.",
                "Two sets of Community rules must be examined concerning the situation of nationals of third countries or stateless persons attempting to enter, unlawfully, the territory of member States, some of whom might be in need of international protection.",
                "Firstly, the Community acquis in the field of asylum is intended to safeguard the right of asylum, as set forth in Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and with other relevant treaties. However, that acquis, including the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive, applies only to asylum applications made on the territory of Member States, which includes the borders, transit areas and, in the context of maritime borders, territorial waters of Member States. Consequently, it is clear from a legal standpoint that the Community acquis in the field of asylum does not apply to situations on the high seas.",
                "Secondly, the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) requires that Member States conduct border surveillance to prevent, inter alia, unauthorised border crossings (Article 12 of EC Regulation No. 562/2006 (SBC)). However, that Community obligation must be fulfilled in compliance with the principle of non-refoulement and without prejudice to the rights of refugees and other people requesting international protection.",
                "The Commission is of the opinion that border surveillance activities conducted at sea, whether in territorial waters, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone or on the high seas, fall within the scope of application of the SBC. In that connection, our preliminary legal analysis would suggest that the activities of the Italian border guards correspond to the notion of ‘border surveillance’ as set forth in Article 12 of the SBC, because they prevented the unauthorised crossing of an external sea border by the persons concerned and resulted in them being returned to the third country of departure. According to the case-law of the European Court of Justice, Community obligations must be applied in strict compliance with the fundamental rights forming part of the general principles of Community law. The Court has also clarified that the scope of application of those rights in the Community legal system must be determined taking account of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).",
                "The principle of non-refoulement, as interpreted by the ECHR, essentially means that States must refrain from returning a person (directly or indirectly) to a place where he or she could face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment. Furthermore, States may not send refugees back to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. That obligation must be fulfilled when carrying out any border control in accordance with the SBC, including border surveillance activities on the high seas. The case-law of the ECHR provides that acts carried out on the high seas by a State vessel constitute cases of extraterritorial jurisdiction and may engage the responsibility of the State concerned.",

The Committee emphasised that Italy was bound by the principle of non-refoulement wherever it exercised its jurisdiction, which included via its personnel and vessels engaged in border protection or rescue at sea, even when operating outside its territory. Moreover, all persons coming within Italy’s jurisdiction should be afforded an appropriate opportunity and facilities to seek international protection. The information available to the CPT indicated that no such opportunity or facilities were afforded to the migrants intercepted at sea by the Italian authorities during the period examined. On the contrary, the persons who were pushed back to Libya in the operations carried out from May to July 2009 were denied the right to obtain an individual assessment of their case and effective access to the refugee-protection system. In that connection, the CPT observed that persons surviving a sea voyage were particularly vulnerable and often not in a condition in which they should be expected to declare immediately their wish to apply for asylum.",

Such a prohibition should also apply to measures to push back migrants on the high seas, carried out without any preliminary formal decision, in so far as such measures could constitute “hidden expulsions”.

Thus, it was “agreed that the adoption of [Article 4] and paragraph 1 of Article 3 could in no way be interpreted as in any way justifying measures of collective expulsion which may have been taken in the past”. The commentary on the draft reveals that, according to the Committee of Experts, the aliens to whom the Article refers are not only those lawfully resident on the territory but “all those who have no actual right to nationality in a State, whether they are passing through a country or reside or are domiciled in it, whether they are refugees or entered the country on their own initiative, or whether they are stateless or possess another nationality” (Article 4 of the final Committee draft, p. 505, § 34). Lastly, according to the drafters of Protocol No. 4, the word “expulsion” should be interpreted “in the generic meaning, in current use (to drive away from a place)”.

If, therefore, Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 were to apply only to collective expulsions from the national territory of the States Parties to the Convention, a significant component of contemporary migratory patterns would not fall within the ambit of that provision, notwithstanding the fact that the conduct it is intended to prohibit can occur outside national territory and in particular, as in the instant case, on the high seas. Article 4 would thus be ineffective in practice with regard to such situations, which, however, are on the increase.

Where, however, as in the instant case, the Court has found that a Contracting State has, exceptionally, exercised its jurisdiction outside its national territory, it does not see any obstacle to accepting that the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by that State took the form of collective expulsion. To conclude otherwise, and to afford that last notion a strictly territorial scope, would result in a discrepancy between the scope of application of the Convention as such and that of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, which would go against the principle that the Convention must be interpreted as a whole. Furthermore, as regards the exercise by a State of its jurisdiction on the high seas, the Court has already stated that the special nature of the maritime environment cannot justify an area outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction (see Medvedyev and Others, cited above, § 81)."

It follows that it is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. Nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible."

                "197. Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured. The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 157, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI)."

It results from the Court’s case-law that an applicant’s complaint alleging that his or her removal to a third State would expose him or her to treatment prohibited under Article 3 of the Convention “must imperatively be subject to close scrutiny by a ‘national authority’” (see Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 448, ECHR 2005-III; see also Jabari, cited above, § 39). That principle has led the Court to rule that the notion of “effective remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 3 requires, firstly, “independent and rigorous scrutiny” of any complaint made by a person in such a situation, where “there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3” and, secondly, “the possibility of suspending the implementation of the measure impugned” (see the above-cited judgments, § 460 and § 50 respectively)."

It pointed out in particular (§ 79):",
                "“The Court considers that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy may prevent the execution of measures that are contrary to the Convention and whose effects are potentially irreversible ...

France, no. 25389/05, § 66, ECHR 2007-II, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 293).",

After retracing the details of the operations, including the fact that “on 13 June at 6 a.m. the French frigate spotted a merchant ship – first on its radar, then visually – travelling at slow speed and flying no flag, and identified it as the Winner ”, it pronounced judgment in the following terms:",
                "“Considering that the international effort to combat drug trafficking is governed by three conventions: the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 30 March 1961, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on [10] December 1982, and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988; while France has signed and ratified all three conventions, Cambodia has not signed the Vienna Convention, Article 17 § 3 of which provides for derogations from the traditional principle of the ‘law of the flag State’.",
                "Considering that the applicants wrongly suggest in this case that in keeping with the traditional rule codified in Article 92 of the Montego Bay Convention, the authority of a State on ships on the high seas flying its flag is both full and exclusive and that coercion may be used to ensure that the rules of international law and the State’s own law are respected as Article 108 of that Convention, on ‘Illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances’, stipulates:",
                "1. All States shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions.",
                "2. Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.",
                "Considering that, based on that text and ‘with reference’ to the earlier United Nations Convention of 30 March 1961 against international drug trafficking, the French authorities were within their rights to request Cambodia’s cooperation with a view to obtaining that country’s authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew was suspected of being involved; that as the provisions of the Vienna Convention do not apply to Cambodia, it was for that State to ask the French authorities for all the relevant information concerning the alleged drug trafficking to enable it to assess the merits of the request using its unfettered discretion; that the diplomatic telegram sent by the French embassy on 7 June 2002, which actually mentions the reasoned request submitted by the OCRTIS, suffices to establish the existence of an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the government of Cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences, and is authoritative until proven otherwise; that on this point the applicants cannot contend that the document does not meet the formal requirements of Article 17 § 3 of the Vienna Convention concerning bilateral agreements between parties, when they are also arguing that the Vienna Convention is not applicable to Cambodia because it has not signed it; and that the value of the diplomatic document is not affected by the fact that the accused did not know the exact status of the person who signed the message or the person who transmitted the Cambodian government’s agreement to the French embassy.",
                "Considering, on the other hand, that in proceeding to intercept the Winner it was the duty of the French authorities to comply with the procedures provided for both in the Vienna Convention signed by France – in particular to ‘take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea, the security of the vessel and its cargo’ – and in the Law of 15 July 1994, as amended by the Law of 29 April 1996 adapting French law to Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, Articles 12 et seq. of which define the sphere of competence of commanders of naval vessels and the procedures for the search, reporting, prosecution and judgment in the French courts of drug trafficking offences committed at sea.",
                "Considering that the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, duly authorised by the maritime prefect for the Atlantic, which are authoritative until proven otherwise, state that when the frigate drew within sight of the Winner, off the Cape Verde islands, the merchant ship was flying no flag and its captain not only failed to answer the requests to identify his ship, in breach of the rules of international law, and to stop his ship, but responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the French frigate and the lives of the sailors on board the speedboat; that it was also reported that the crew of the Winner were seen to be throwing suspicious parcels overboard, one of which was recovered and found to contain a large quantity of cocaine; that all these elements together amounted to reasonable grounds for the commander of the frigate to suspect that he was in the presence of drug traffickers who had jettisoned their cargo before attempting to escape; and that by using force to board the Winner and taking appropriate coercive measures to control the crew and confine them to their cabins and to take over and sail the ship, the commander of the frigate acted in strict compliance with:",
                "– the provisions of Article 17 § 4 of the Vienna Convention under which, if evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found after a ship has been boarded and searched, appropriate action may be taken with respect to the vessel and the persons and cargo on board,",
                "– the provisions of the Law of 15 July 1994 as supplemented by the Law of 29 April 1996, which, in its general provisions (Articles 1 to 10) regulates recourse to coercive measures comprising, if necessary, the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to control and also, in the particular case of the fight against drug trafficking (Articles 12 to 14), makes provision for the implementation of the control and coercion measures provided for under international law.",
                "Considering that, regard being had to the distinctly aggressive conduct of the captain of the Winner in attempting to evade inspection by the French naval authorities, and to the attitude of the crew members, who took advantage of the time thus gained to eliminate any traces of the drug trafficking by deliberately throwing the evidence overboard, the members of the commando unit who boarded the ship found themselves in the presence of large-scale international trafficking and were likely at any moment to come up against a hostile and potentially dangerous crew who could threaten the security of their mission; that they were obliged to use their weapons in response to the resistance put up by one of the ship’s crew; that it cannot be claimed that Article 13 of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended provides only for administrative assistance measures and excludes any form of coercion in respect of people when it stipulates in general terms that the competent maritime authorities are authorised to carry out or have carried out ‘the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law’, and Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs [and Psychotropic Substances] expressly mentions taking ‘appropriate action with respect to the persons on board’; that although the nature of these measures is not specified, the text at least provides for the possibility for the competent naval authorities to limit, if necessary, the freedom of the boarded ship’s crew to come and go, otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised; that it cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew may have weapons hidden away and may seek to regain control of the ship by force; that consequently, confining the members of the crew of the Winner – all but the wounded man, who was transferred to the frigate – to their cabins under the guard of the commando unit, so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted, fell within the appropriate measures provided for in Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention.",
                "Considering that the Law of 15 July 1994 necessarily requires some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas, in keeping with the rules of international law, and for the fact that it is impossible in practice, bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination, to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge; and, that being so, that the restrictions placed on the movements of the boarded ship’s crew, as authorised in such cases by the United Nations Convention signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, were not at variance with Article 5 § 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and did not amount to unlawful detention; and that it should be noted that as soon as the Winner docked in Brest, its crew were handed over to the police, immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody, then brought before the investigating judge.",
                "Considering also that the French courts have jurisdiction under the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended.",

It found it sufficient to rely on Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention, which provides: ‘Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.’ On the other hand, when carrying out the interception, a State Party to the Vienna Convention which stops such a ship – in this case, France – must comply with the rules laid down therein and may thus rely on the provisions of Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, concerning coercion measures. In this case the Court found that the jurisdiction of the flag State was not exclusive when it assented to a request to intervene.",

In addition to the fact that the Winner did not fit into any of those categories, it noted that the Law of 15 July 1994 had been amended, inter alia, so that it no longer referred only to States Parties to the Vienna Convention. It also considered that the Government’s argument concerning the applicability of and compliance with the legal provisions concerned was based on a contradiction, as they had submitted that at the time of the interception the Winner had been flying no flag, while at the same time asserting that the French authorities had previously sought confirmation from the Cambodian authorities that the ship was registered in their country and that the ship had been identified as the Winner before the operations commenced."

On this last point the Chamber noted that although measures taken under the Law of 15 July 1994 were taken under the supervision of the public prosecutor, the public prosecutor was not a “competent legal authority” within the meaning the Court’s case-law gave to that notion (see Schiesser v.

The fact that Cambodia granted that request could not be likened to a request for cooperation within the meaning of Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention.

They maintained that it could not be considered as a delegation of jurisdiction to France. Even assuming, for argument’s sake, that such an ad hoc agreement did justify French intervention in keeping with the principle of public international law that a State could relinquish part of its sovereignty other than by a convention, they alleged that the limits of such an exceptional transfer of power had been considerably exceeded in the present case. According to the Government’s own submissions, the agreement had merely concerned a “request to intercept”, while the Cambodian government had only authorised the “stopping” of the ship (“ arraisonnement ” in French). Strictly speaking, this consisted solely in stopping the ship at sea or on arrival in port to make certain verifications (concerning its identity and its nationality, for example): it did not extend to searches or arrests on board the ship. Yet that was what had happened in this case: the applicants had been arrested and confined to their cabins for thirteen days. Their detention on board the Winner and their judgment in another country had not been authorised by Cambodia. The applicants thus challenged the existence of any ad hoc agreement justifying the stopping of the Winner and considered that even if there had been such an agreement, it did not justify the detention of the crew following the French military operation."

In their preliminary observations the Government stressed that the events in this case had taken place on the high seas, so that it was necessary to take into account the specificities of the maritime environment and of navigation at sea. In the Government’s submissions this had two specific consequences. First of all, the Convention was completely silent about maritime matters and the Government argued that it was possible to draw a parallel with the solution adopted by the Court in cases concerning the handing over of persons by one State to another in the context of extradition (see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005-IV; Freda v. Italy, no. 8916/80, Commission decision of 7 October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 21, p. 254; Altmann (Barbie) v.

The Government considered that “the same reasoning, mutatis mutandis, could be applied in this case” for want of any provision in the Convention concerning arrangements for rerouting ships, or specific provisions concerning maritime matters, which made the Convention inapplicable ratione materiae."

Secondly, they submitted that freedom to come and go on board a ship had more restrictive limits, which were the confines of the ship itself: the lawful rerouting of a ship therefore necessarily authorised restrictions on the movements of the people on board; the specificities and the risks of navigation at sea justified the extensive powers enjoyed by ships’ captains. The Government inferred that the applicants had not been deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5 but had been subjected to restrictions of liberty that were justified, restrictions they were challenging on a purely formalistic and litigious basis.

The Montego Bay Convention well illustrated the signatory States’ aim of “cohabitation” in what belonged to all and yet to none, by strictly defining the conditions in which a State could interfere with another State’s sovereignty by having a naval vessel inspect a ship flying a foreign flag. And although Cambodia was not a party to the Vienna Convention, the agreement which that sovereign State had given by diplomatic note had been self-sufficient with regard to the principles of public international law and the law of the sea. The diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 had authorised the stopping of the ship and all “its consequences”, as confirmed by the Cambodian authorities in their note of 9 September 2008. In such circumstances the agreement concerned had provided a legal basis for the rerouting of the Winner and its crew."

As the sea could be a “safe haven” (see Öcalan, cited above, § 88) for traffickers, international law had provided for the flag State to be able to delegate its power to combat this type of crime. The Government further noted that in Rigopoulos v. Spain ((dec.), no. 37388/97, ECHR 1999-II), the Court had found that the verbal agreement given to Spain by Panama had been sufficient to make the operations lawful under public international law."

They submitted that in any event the Investigation Division had not based its findings solely on Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, but also on the general provisions of Law no. 94-589 of 15 July 1994, which empowered commanders of naval vessels responsible for surveillance at sea to carry out, or have carried out “inspection and coercion measures”. They accordingly considered that that part of the law had provided a legal basis for the measures complained of, because the ship was suspected of drug trafficking and because it had been flying no flag, had refused to identify itself and had responded aggressively by making dangerous manoeuvres."

So, as the law provided for the ship to be rerouted, it also provided for restriction of the freedom of movement of those on board, as the two were inseparable. According to the Government, the rerouting was nevertheless to be considered as a preliminary to the suspects being brought before the judicial authorities."

The Government also pointed out that the length of the voyage had merely been a material contingency and that the applicants had not been questioned during the thirteen days spent on board, naval personnel having no power to take such action.

When the Winner was spotted off Cape Verde on 13 June 2002, the frigate issued several warnings and fired warning shots, before firing directly at the merchant ship, under orders from France’s maritime prefect for the Atlantic. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team were obliged to use their weapons to defend themselves, and subsequently kept the crew members under their exclusive guard and confined them to their cabins during the journey to France, where they arrived on 26 June 2002. The rerouting of the Winner to France, by a decision of the French authorities, was made possible by sending a tug out of Brest harbour to tow the ship back to the French port, escorted by another warship, the frigate Commandant Bouan, all under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the Brest public prosecutor."

In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 the starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Amuur v.

As it has pointed out on numerous occasions, in view of the ravages drugs cause it can see in particular why the authorities of the Contracting States are so firm towards those who contribute to the spread of this scourge, and it is fully aware of the need to combat drug trafficking and, accordingly, to secure fruitful cooperation between States in this area. Nevertheless, the special nature of the maritime environment relied upon by the Government in the instant case cannot justify an area outside the law where ships’ crews are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction, any more than it can provide offenders with a “safe haven”.",

It does not provide in general for States to request cooperation whenever they suspect a ship not flying their flag of such trafficking. The Court considers that Article 108 does not provide any legal basis for the action taken by the French authorities in this case. As Cambodia is not party to the Montego Bay Convention, it cannot have been acting under that Convention when it sent its diplomatic note of 7 June 2002.

Lastly, while the provisions of the Montego Bay Convention concerning illegal drug trafficking on the high seas appear to suggest that the issue was not a part of customary law when that Convention was signed, the Government have not shown that there has since been any constant practice on the part of the States capable of establishing the existence of a principle of customary international law generally authorising the intervention of any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying the flag of another State is engaged in illicit traffic in drugs."

                "88. Furthermore, as regards the nationality of the ship, the Court shares the view of the Chamber and the applicants that the Government’s arguments are based on a contradiction. It is an undisputed fact that the meeting of the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff and the Winner owed nothing to chance. The Winner was under the observation of the American, Spanish and Greek drug control agencies when the Central Office Against Illegal Drug Trafficking (“the OCRTIS”), which suspected it of transporting a large quantity of drugs for the European market, requested authorisation to intercept it. The ship’s nationality being known in fact as early as 7 June 2002, the French embassy requested Cambodia’s consent to the French authorities’ intervention; that agreement was given in a diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 and the Ministry of Defence in Paris was immediately informed. Thus, by 7 June 2002 at the latest the Winner had been precisely identified as a ship flying the Cambodian flag, as expressly stated in the diplomatic note sent by the Cambodian authorities. As to the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, it had been at anchor in Brest harbour, and had already been assigned another mission off the African coast when, instead, it was specially instructed to set sail immediately to intercept the Winner. In order to carry out this clearly defined mission it took on board a French navy special forces team specialised in boarding vessels at sea, as well as three experts from the OCRTIS."

In view of these elements, the Government cannot reasonably argue that the situation provided for in Article 110 of the Montego Bay Convention, concerning the possibility for a warship to board a ship if it has reasonable grounds to suspect that that ship is without nationality (see paragraph 28 above), applies to the present case. The circumstances of the case do not support such an assertion. Moreover, the judgment of the Investigation Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal states quite plainly that the merchant ship spotted on 13 June 2002 at 6 a.m. was identified as the Winner (see paragraph 22 above)."

Furthermore, although the purpose of the Montego Bay Convention was, inter alia, to codify or consolidate the customary law of the sea, its provisions concerning illicit traffic in narcotic drugs on the high seas – like those of the complementary Vienna Convention, organising international cooperation without making it mandatory – reflect a lack of consensus and of clear, agreed rules and practices in the matter at the international level."

In the Court’s opinion, although the provisions of Article 108 § 2 of the Montego Bay Convention do not apply to the present case, as Cambodia has not ratified that instrument, they do not prevent States from envisaging other forms of collaboration to combat drug trafficking at sea.

Such cooperation may take various forms, particularly in view of the vague wording of the provisions of Article 17 § 4 (c), which merely refers to “appropriate action”, and give rise, for example, to regional agreements, like the Council of Europe Agreement of 31 January 1995 implementing Article 17 of the Vienna Convention (see paragraph 30 above) and the San José Agreement of 10 April 2003 on regional cooperation in the Caribbean (see paragraphs 31-33 above), or to the bilateral treaties referred to in Article 17 § 9 of the Vienna Convention."

On this point the Court observes first of all that the text of the diplomatic note mentions “the ship Winner, flying the Cambodian flag”, the sole object of the agreement, confirming the authorisation to intercept, inspect and take legal action against it (see paragraph 10 above). Evidently, therefore, the fate of the crew was not covered sufficiently clearly by the note and so it is not established that their deprivation of liberty was the subject of an agreement between the two States that could be considered to represent a “clearly defined law” within the meaning of the Court’s case ‑ law. As to the explanatory diplomatic note produced by the Cambodian authorities on 9 September 2008 in response to a request from the French authorities of 3 September 2008 and submitted by the respondent Government for the first time to the Grand Chamber, after the Chamber pronounced its finding of a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and more than six years after the events, the applicants having had no opportunity at the material time to familiarise themselves with the explanations given, the Court does not consider it decisive."

Added to the fact that Cambodia had not ratified the relevant conventions, this shows that the intervention of the French authorities on the basis of an ad hoc agreement cannot reasonably be said to have been “foreseeable” within the meaning of the Court’s case-law, even with the help of appropriate advice. In any event, the Court considers that the foreseeability, for an offender, of prosecution for drug trafficking should not be confused with the foreseeability of the law pleaded as the basis for the intervention. Otherwise, any activity considered criminal under domestic law would release the States from their obligation to pass laws having the requisite qualities, particularly with regard to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and, in so doing, deprive that provision of its substance."

The fact remains that when a flag State, like Cambodia in this case, is not a party to the Montego Bay or Vienna Conventions, the insufficiency of such legal instruments, for want of regional or bilateral initiatives, is of no real consequence. In fact, such initiatives are not always supported by the States in spite of the fact that they afford the possibility of acting within a clearly defined legal framework. In any event, for States that are not parties to the Montego Bay and Vienna Conventions one solution might be to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements, like the San José Agreement of 2003, with other States. Having regard to the gravity and enormity of the problem posed by illegal drug trafficking, developments in public international law which embraced the principle that all States have jurisdiction as an exception to the law of the flag State would be a significant step in the fight against illegal trade in narcotics. This would bring international law on drug trafficking into line with what has already existed for many years now in respect of piracy."

Taking the initial stage under the first limb, which is the only one at issue here, the Court’s case-law establishes that there must be protection, through judicial control, of an individual arrested or detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. Such control serves to provide effective safeguards against the risk of ill-treatment, which is at its greatest in this early stage of detention, and against the abuse of powers bestowed on law enforcement officers or other authorities for what should be narrowly restricted purposes and exercisable strictly in accordance with prescribed procedures. The judicial control must satisfy the following requirements (see McKay, cited above, § 32):"

The automatic nature of the review is necessary to fulfil the purpose of that paragraph, as a person subjected to ill-treatment might be incapable of lodging an application asking for a judge to review their detention; the same might also be true of other vulnerable categories of arrested person, such as the mentally frail or those ignorant of the language of the judicial officer (see Aquilina, cited above).",

In its decision, the Court noted that the distance to be covered was “considerable” (the ship was 5,500 km from Spanish territory when it was intercepted), and that a forty-three-hour delay caused by resistance put up by the ship’s crew “could not be attributed to the Spanish authorities”. It concluded that it had been “materially impossible to bring the applicant physically before the investigating judge any sooner”, while taking into account the fact that once he had arrived on Spanish soil the applicant had been immediately transferred to Madrid by air and brought before the judicial authority on the following day. Lastly, the Court considered “unrealistic” the applicant’s suggestion that, under an agreement between Spain and the United Kingdom to prevent illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, instead of being diverted to Spain the ship could have been taken to Ascension Island, which was approximately 1,600 km from where it was intercepted."

In addition, the applicants did not claim that they could have been handed over to the authorities of a country nearer than France, where they could have been brought promptly before a judicial authority.

The Co-Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas. They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents. The Co-Chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the NK conflict, and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement.”"

We express our deep regret that, rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests, the parties have continued to seek one-sided advantage in the negotiation process.",

The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict. A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region, resulting in loss of life, more destruction, additional refugees, and enormous financial costs. We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the Helsinki principles, particularly those relating to the non-use of force or the threat of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict. The leaders should prepare their people for peace, not war.",

The Court first considers that the situation pertaining in Nagorno - Karabakh and the surrounding territories is not one of Armenian State agents exercising authority and control over individuals abroad, as alternatively argued by the applicants. Instead, the issue to be determined on the facts of the case is whether Armenia exercised and continues to exercise effective control over the mentioned territories and as a result may be held responsible for the alleged violations. As noted by the Court in Catan and Others (cited above, § 107), this assessment will primarily depend on military involvement, but other indicators, such as economic and political support, may also be of relevance."

The district is sheltered by Nagorno-Karabakh to the east, by the districts of Kelbajar as well as Gubadly and Jebrayil to the north and south and by Armenia to the west. To determine whether Armenia has jurisdiction in the present case, it is thus necessary to assess whether it exercises effective control over Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories as a whole."

More significantly, in December 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR and the Nagorno-Karabakh Regional Council adopted a Joint Resolution on the reunification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and, in January 1990, a joint budget was established. It is clear that, since the beginning of the conflict, the Armenian SSR and Armenia have strongly supported the demands for Nagorno-Karabakh ’ s incorporation into Armenia or, alternatively, its independence from Azerbaijan."

For instance, the UN Security Council Resolutions adopted in 1993, while expressing serious concern at the tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, referred to invasion and occupation by “local Armenian forces” and urged Armenia to exert its influence on “the Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh region” (see paragraph 59 above). Nevertheless, the HRW report ( see paragraph 60 above ) attests to the involvement of the Armenian armed forces at this point in time. Furthermore, the Armenian Minister of Defence from 1992 to 19 93, Mr Vazgen Manukyan, acknowledged this state of affairs ( see paragraph 62 above )."

For instance, while not leading to any agreement between the parties, the “package deal” and the “step-by-step” approach drafted within the Minsk Group in 1997 stated that the Armenian armed forces should withdraw to within the borders of Armenia (see paragraph 61 above). Similar demands were made by the UN General Assembly in March 2008 ( see paragraph 67 above ) and by the European Parliament in April 2012 ( see paragraph 70 above ). In January 2005 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, noting the occupation by Armenian forces of “considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan”, reaffirmed that independence and secession of a territory may not be achieved in the wake of “the de facto annexation of such territory to another state” ( see paragraph 64 above ). The International Crisis Group ( ICG ) report of September 2005 concluded, on the basis of statements by Armenian soldiers and officials, that “ [ t ] here is a high degree of integration between the forces of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh” ( see paragraph 65 above ). Indications of service of Armenian soldiers in the “NKR” can also be found in cases before the Court and elsewhere ( see paragraphs 76 - 77 above )."

However, statements from high-ranking officials, even former ministers and officials, who have played a central role in the dispute in question are of particular evidentiary value when they acknowledge facts or conduct that place the authorities in an unfavourable light. They may then be construed as a form of admission (see in this context, mutatis mutandis, the judgment of the International Court of Justice in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. the United States of America) ( Merits ) Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, § 64)."

The statement by Mr Manukyan, the former Minister of Defence, has already been mentioned (see paragraph 62 above). Of even greater significance is the speech given by the incumbent President of Armenia, Mr Serzh Sargsyan, in January 2013, to leaders of the Ministry of Defence, in which he declared that the goal of Armenian foreign policy was to achieve legal recognition of the victory attained by “our Army” in the Nagorno-Karabakh war ( see paragraph 72 above ).

The number of Armenian soldiers serving in the “NKR” is in dispute; the Government have stated that they number no more than 1,500 persons while the applicants rely on the figures given by the IISS and the ICG between 2002 and 2005 which indicated that 8,000 or 10,000 Armenian troops are deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above). The Court need not solve this issue as, based on the numerous reports and statements presented above, it finds it established that Armenia, through its military presence and the provision of military equipment and expertise, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date. This military support has been – and continues to be – decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the territories in issue, and the evidence, not least the Agreement, convincingly shows that the Armenian armed forces and the “NKR” are highly integrated."

The integration of the two entities is further shown by the number of politicians who have assumed the highest offices in Armenia after previously holding similar positions in the “NKR” (see paragraph 78 above). The general political support given to the “NKR” by Armenia is also evident from the statements mentioned above in regard to Armenia ’ s military involvement."

                "182. The Government have claimed that the “NKR” has its own legislation and its own independent political and judicial bodies. However, its political dependence on Armenia is evident not only from the interchange of prominent politicians, but also from the fact that its residents acquire Armenian passports for travel abroad as the “NKR” is not recognised by any State or international organisation (see paragraph 83 above). In regard to the legislation and the judiciary, there is further evidence of integration. The Government have acknowledged that several laws of the “NKR” have been adopted from Armenian legislation. More importantly, the facts of Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan ( see paragraph 76 above ) show not only the presence of Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh but also the operation of Armenian law - enforcement agents and the exercise of jurisdiction by Armenian courts on that territory. The case of Mr Grigoryan ( see paragraph 77 above ) provides a similar indication."

The ICG reported that, in the 2005 “NKR” budget, only 26.7 % of expenditures were covered by locally collected revenues. An Armenian “inter- State loan” has provided the “NKR” with considerable amounts of money, throughout 2004 and 2005, totalling USD 51 million. According to the ICG, relying on official sources, the loan made up 67.3% of the “NKR” budget in 2001 and 56.9% in 2004. The loan has been in place since 1993, and in 2005, the year of the report, none of the loan had been repaid (see paragraphs 80 - 81 above)."

Further assistance is provided by the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund which, according to the Government, allocated about USD 111 million to projects in the “NKR” between 1995 and 2012. While the Fund is not a governmental institution and its resources come from individual donations, it is noteworthy that it was established by presidential decree. Furthermore, the Armenian President is the ex officio President of the Board of Trustees, and the Board includes several present and former Presidents and ministers of Armenia and the “NKR”, as well as other prominent officials of Armenia. While these members do not make up a majority, it is clear from the Board ’ s composition that the official representatives of Armenia – together with their “NKR” counterparts – are in a position to greatly influence the Fund ’ s activities."

All of the above reveals that Armenia, from the early days of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, has had a significant and decisive influence over the “NKR”, that the two entities are highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persists to this day. In other words, the “NKR” and its administration survive by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercises effective control over Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the surrounding territories, including the district of Lachin. The matters complained of therefore come within the jurisdiction of Armenia for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention."

On 2 September the Soviet of the NKAO announced the establishment of the “ Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh ” (the “NKR”), consisting of the territory of the NKAO and the Shahumyan district of Azerbaijan, and declared that it was no longer under Azerbaijani jurisdiction. On 26 November the Azerbaijani Parliament abolished the autonomy previously enjoyed by Nagorno-Karabakh. In a referendum organised in Nagorno-Karabakh on 10 December, 99.9% of those participating voted in favour of secession. However, the Azeri population boycotted the referendum. In the same month, the Soviet Union was dissolved and Soviet troops began to withdraw from the region. Military control of Nagorno ‑ Karabakh was rapidly being handed over to the Karabakh Armenians. On 6 January 1992 the “NKR”, having regard to the results of the referendum, reaffirmed its independence from Azerbaijan."

The Basic Principles, which have since been updated, call, inter alia, for the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance; a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh; a future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding referendum; the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation. The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement. Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by Minsk Group diplomats and a number of meetings between the Presidents of the two countries in 2009, the process lost momentum in 2010.

The Co-Chairs were joined by the Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and his team, which provided logistical support, and by two experts from the UNHCR and one member of the 2005 OSCE Fact-Finding Mission. This was the first mission by the international community to the territories since 2005, and the first visit by UN personnel in 18 years.",

Towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins. While no reliable figures exist, the overall population is roughly estimated as 14,000 persons, living in small settlements and in the towns of Lachin and Kelbajar. The Co-Chairs assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since 2005. The settlers, for the most part ethnic Armenians who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in Azerbaijan, live in precarious conditions, with poor infrastructure, little economic activity, and limited access to public services. Many lack identity documents. For administrative purposes, the seven territories, the former NK Oblast, and other areas have been incorporated into eight new districts.",

The Co-Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas. They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents. The Co-Chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the NK conflict, and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement.”"

A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region, resulting in loss of life, more destruction, additional refugees, and enormous financial costs. We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the Helsinki principles, particularly those relating to the non-use of force or the threat of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict.

The Republic of Armenia as a Party to the Conflict ). Allegedly, Armenia had even sent members of its police force to perform police duties in the occupied territories. HRW spent two days in April 1994 interviewing Armenian uniformed soldiers on the streets of Yerevan. 30% of them were draftees in the Armenian army who had either fought in Karabakh, had orders to go to Karabakh or had ostensibly volunteered for service there. Moreover, on a single day in April 1994 HRW researchers had counted five buses holding an estimated 300 soldiers of the Armenian army entering Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia. Other western journalists had reported to HRW researchers that they had seen eight more buses full of Armenian army soldiers heading for Azerbaijani territory from Armenia.

The highly trained and equipped Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army is primarily a ground force, for which Armenia provides much of the backbone. A Nagorno-Karabakh official told Crisis Group it has some 20,000 soldiers, while an independent expert [U.S. military analyst Richard Giragosian, July 2005] estimated 18,500. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 reservists allegedly could be mobilised. Based on its population, Nagorno ‑ Karabakh cannot sustain such a large force without relying on substantial numbers of outsiders. According to an independent assessment [by Mr Giragosian], there are 8,500 Karabakh Armenians in the army and 10,000 from Armenia. ...",

He claims that no Armenian citizens are unwillingly conscripted and says 500,000 Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh descent live in Armenia, some of whom serve in the Nagorno ‑ Karabakh forces. Former conscripts from Yerevan and other towns in Armenia have told Crisis Group they were seemingly arbitrarily sent to Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the occupied districts immediately after presenting themselves to the recruitment bureau. They deny that they ever volunteered to go to Nagorno ‑ Karabakh or the adjacent occupied territory. They were not paid a bonus for serving outside Armenia, and they performed military service in Nagorno-Karabakh uniform, under Nagorno-Karabakh military command. Young Armenian recruits ’ opposition to serving in Nagorno-Karabakh has increased, which may help explain an apparent decrease in the numbers being sent to [ Nagorno- Karabakh].",

Article 2 of this Law provides that the “NKR decides independently all issues concerning the Republic ’ s political, economic, social and cultural, construction, administrative and territorial division policies”. Furthermore, in January 1992 bodies of executive and judicial power were created, including the Council of Ministers ( its government), the Supreme Court and first - instance courts of the “NKR”, as well as the “NKR” prosecutor ’ s office. The “NKR” also has its own President, Parliament and police force, as well as local self-government bodies, including administrations governing the territories surrounding the “NKR”, whose representatives are appointed by “NKR” authorities. It also holds its own presidential and parliamentary elections. While several laws have been adopted from Armenian legislation, the Government maintained that they did not apply automatically, that is, by decisions of Armenian courts, but were independently interpreted and applied by “NKR” courts, whether in the district of Lachin or elsewhere."

However, Nagorno-Karabakh ’ s (de facto) prime minister argues that part of this loan – 4.259 billion drams (about $9.46 million) – is in fact Armenia ’ s repayment of VAT, customs and excise duties that Armenia levies on goods that pass through its territory, destined for Nagorno-Karabakh. The remainder of the loan has a ten-year repayment period at nominal interest. Though Armenia has provided such loans since 1993, nothing has been repaid.

The Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV). The Court cannot emphasise enough that it is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdiction (see Demopoulos and Others v.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights ...",

The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective ...",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement ... One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.",

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article [35] must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism ... It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case ... This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants.”",

While maintaining that Armenia has no jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh and, in particular, the district of Lachin, the Government claimed that the applicants could have been afforded redress by judicial and administrative bodies in Armenia and the “NKR”. They referred to provisions in the laws of the two entities concerning land disputes, including issues of restitution and compensation in case of someone else ’ s illegal possession. They also presented statements by domestic judges and officials to the effect that the courts of Armenia and the “NKR” are independent and impartial and are ready to adjudicate cases brought by Azerbaijani citizens without discrimination. The applicants and the Azerbaijani Government, for their part, asserted that the laws of Armenia and the “NKR” did not provide any redress for displaced persons who had been dispossessed of their property in circumstances similar to those of the applicants."

The Court finds that, for the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, it need not determine whether Armenia can be considered to have jurisdiction over the area in question and whether such jurisdiction would have an effect on the operation of its domestic remedies on the issues of the restitution of or compensation for property situated in the disputed territories. The reason for this is that the Government have not shown that there is a remedy – in Armenia or in the “NKR” – capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints. The legal provisions referred to by them are of a general nature and do not address the specific situation of dispossession of property as a result of armed conflict, or in any other way relate to a situation similar to that of the applicants. As regards the domestic judgments submitted by way of example in June 2007 (see paragraph 109 above), none of them relate to claims concerning the loss of homes or property by persons displaced in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

It should also be noted that Armenia has denied that its armed forces or other authorities have been involved in the events giving rise to the complaints in the present case, or that Armenia exercises – or has at any point in time exercised – jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. Given such a denial of involvement or jurisdiction, it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to bring claims for restitution or compensation before the Armenian courts and authorities. Regard must further be had to the political and general context. As a consequence of the war, virtually all Azerbaijanis have left the disputed territories. No political solution of the conflict has been reached. Rather, the hostile rhetoric between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan appears to have intensified, ceasefire breaches are recurrent and the military build-up in the region has escalated in recent years. In these circumstances, it is not realistic that any possible remedy in the unrecognised “NKR” entity could in practice afford displaced Azerbaijanis effective redress."

They referred, inter alia, to the technical passports, statements by witnesses and invoices for building materials and building subsidies. As regards the technical passports, the applicants maintained that they, in all details, complied with the formal requirements under the domestic law in force at the material time. They explained that the discrepancies between the statements made in the application form and the specifications contained in the passports were due to the statements given to their representative in difficult circumstances in Baku in early 2005 during a brief meeting. The original statements were made from memory, without access to documents, and it was therefore the information contained in the passports that was correct and should be taken into account. The applicants further asserted that the passports constituted secondary evidence of their possessions. In addition, the sixth applicant had submitted primary evidence in the form of an abstract from the session protocol of the Soviet of People ’ s Deputies of Lachin District of 29 January 1974 that contained the decision to allocate land to him. When they fled, they had not had the time to take all of their papers with them.

Both rights allegedly constituted possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, the 1991 Law on property in Azerbaijan made reference to a land plot as the object of individual ownership and thus gave the applicants a legitimate expectation of becoming owners of land."

The Government contended that, with the exception of the sixth applicant, the applicants had not submitted any evidence with their application that could prove that they in fact had any property, let alone that the property was located on the territory claimed and that they had owned it at the relevant time. In the Government ’ s view, it was remarkable that, although they all claimed to have fled empty-handed, the technical passports of the other five applicants had later appeared out of nowhere. Furthermore, the statements of friends and neighbours submitted to the Court amounted to no more than hearsay. In respect of all the applicants, the Government maintained that they had failed to prove “beyond reasonable doubt” that they were the persons they claimed to be, that they had resided in the territories specified by them or that they owned the property in question. In particular, the documents provided by them contained numerous contradictions and inaccuracies. For instance, the second applicant had first claimed to have lived in the village of Chirag and had then changed this to Chiragli. Moreover, most of the technical passports submitted as proof of ownership gave different figures with regard to the size of the houses to the figures stated by the applicants themselves. The Government also claimed that a technical passport is a document showing the technical condition of a building and nothing else, unless its origin and provenance is established."
            ],
            [
                "124. The Government further questioned whether the applicants had ever held a right to the alleged properties that had been recognised under the law in force in 1992 or certified by the appropriate authority. In particular, under the socialist system of the USSR before 1991, land was under the exclusive ownership of the State. While the 1991 Law on property recognised the possibility of private ownership, it did not transfer ownership of land occupied by individuals to them. With respect to individual land users and lessees, the legislation set out that their rights were formalised through a certificate, which was registered in a land register kept by the local Soviet of People ’ s Deputies. Thus, no rights to land could be asserted without such a registered certificate. Furthermore, the Azerbaijani 1992 Land Code stipulated that the rights of a user or lessee could be extinguished following a failure to use the land for a period of two years. As the applicants had not returned to the district of Lachin since 1992, the Government presumed that their alleged rights had been terminated before Armenia became subject to the jurisdiction of the Court in 2002. Furthermore, the applicants ’ claimed legitimate expectation to become owners of land was no longer a realistic expectation in 2002. Furthermore, before that date, the applicants ’ alleged property had been allocated to other individuals, with their names recorded on the land register in accordance with the laws of the “NKR”. Thus, the applicants had no “existing possessions” but were merely claimants seeking to have their property restored or to receive compensation. The Government maintained that no domestic legislation or judicial decision existed which gave rise to a legitimate expectation of such restitution or compensation. However, in the same observations, the Government stated that the “NKR” had not adopted any legal act that deprived the applicants of the right to enter the territory of Lachin or of the right to peacefully enjoy their property.",

The Azerbaijani Government pointed out that almost all displaced persons had had to flee their homes in the occupied territories quickly, without having had the time to collect documents. At the material time, it was impossible to obtain property documents as the records had been kept by the local authorities, and their archives had most likely been destroyed. Nevertheless, a technical passport was classified as an “inventory-technical” document that served to indirectly establish the right to an individual house where the original document was missing. This document constituted secondary evidence of title to a house or a plot of land if its text directly referred to documents confirming the property rights. Such a reference was included in the applicants ’ technical passports. Thus, considered together with the witness statements and building invoices submitted, they demonstrated that the applicants owned individual houses and had the right to use the land plots allotted to them. These rights still existed."

No private ownership existed, however, in regard to land, which was exclusively owned by the State. All land transactions were prohibited, but plots of land were allotted by decision of the local authority, the Soviet of People ’ s Deputies, to citizens for their use for a definite or indefinite period of time, free of charge. The right of use, which was an inheritable title, was granted for purposes such as individual housing, namely the construction of privately owned houses, as well as pasture, haymaking and farming. Furthermore, the 1991 Law on property in Azerbaijan, while not yet enforceable at the relevant time, had added a legitimate expectation for the applicants to become owners of land."

The Turkish Government did not call into question the validity of the applicant ’ s title, but argued that she had lost ownership of the land by virtue of Article 159 of the 1985 Constitution of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”) which declared all abandoned immovable properties to be the property of the “TRNC”. The Court, having regard to the lack of recognition of the “TRNC” as a State by the international community, did not attribute any legal validity to the provision and considered that the applicant could not be deemed to have lost title to her property as a result of it (§§ 42-47)."

In a number of cases related to the above-mentioned conflict, the Court has established the applicants ’ “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on the basis of prima facie evidence which the Government failed convincingly to rebut, including copies of original title deeds, registration certificates, purchase contracts and affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus. As explained by the applicant in Solomonides v. Turkey (no. 16161/90, § 31, 20 January 2009), his titles of ownership had been registered at the District Lands Office. However, at the time of the Turkish military intervention he had been forced to flee and had been unable to take with him the title deeds. The Cypriot authorities had reconstructed the Land Books and had issued certificates of affirmation of title. These certificates were the best evidence available in the absence of the original records or documents. It is noteworthy that in Saveriades v. Turkey (no. 16160/90, 22 September 2009) the reasons why the applicant could not submit the original title deeds were specifically taken into account. The applicant argued that he had been forced to leave his premises, where the documents were held, in great haste and had subsequently been unable to return there or otherwise retrieve the title deeds. The Court accepted that the documents submitted by the applicant (such as a sale contract, ownership certificates and a building permit) provided prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the properties in issue, and continued (§ 18):",

The Court considered that it was not necessary to decide whether or not in the absence of title deeds the applicants had rights of property under domestic law.

The Court further notes that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common lands in the village, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from stockbreeding and tree-felling.

Accordingly, as well as physical goods, certain rights and interests constituting assets may also be regarded as ‘ property rights ’, and thus as ‘ possessions ’ for the purposes of this provision ... The concept of ‘ possessions ’ is not limited to ‘ existing possessions ’ but may also cover assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he has at least a reasonable and ‘ legitimate expectation ’ of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right ...”",

As, moreover, the rights acquired by individuals under the old legislation were not rescinded by the enactment of the 1991/92 property laws, the applicants ’ legal rights to the houses and land that they possessed at the time of their flight must be assessed with reference to the laws of the Azerbaijan SSR."

                "146. Under the Soviet legal system, citizens had a right to own residential houses, but there was no private ownership of land, which instead was considered State property. For the Azerbaijan SSR (including Nagorno-Karabakh and the district of Lachin and the other surrounding territories now under occupation), these rules were laid down in the 1978 Constitution as well as the 1970 Land Code and the 1983 Housing Code. Article 10.3 of the Housing Code provided for the ownership of houses, and the Land Code, notably Articles 4, 25, 27 and 28, laid down the rules and procedures for the allocation of land to individuals for their use. Consequently, the houses that the applicants inhabited in the district of Lachin were part of their personal property, whereas they only had a “right of use” of the plots of land on which these houses stood. As has already been mentioned (see paragraph 138), the moveable property – livestock, carpets, cars – that the applicants claimed to have possessed (the rights to which were also protected by the laws of the Azerbaijan SSR) is likely to have been destroyed during the military attack on Lachin or in the subsequent years. It is further unclear whether their houses have been destroyed or are still partly or wholly intact. Consequently, it is of crucial importance to examine the significance of the “right of use”."

Granted by the local Soviet of People ’ s Deputies, the right could be given for several different purposes, including pasture and farming and – most importantly in the context of the present case – the erection of a house. The beneficiaries were obliged to use the plots of land strictly for the purposes for which they had been allocated. The “right of use” was conferred indefinitely or for a temporary period. Thus, if the individual held an indefinite “right of use” and complied with the purpose specified, he or she could use the land for life. Moreover, the right was inheritable.",
                "There is no doubt, therefore, that the “right of use” conferred on the applicants was a strong and protected right which represented a substantive economic interest. While there is no indication that the applicants ’ rights were of a temporary nature, the Court notes, for the sake of completeness, that this conclusion is applicable to both indefinite and temporary “rights of use”. Having regard to the autonomous meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the “right of use” of land thus constituted a “possession” under that provision. This conclusion applies also to the rights held by individuals to residential houses and moveable property."

In their observations submitted on 11 July 2012, the Government stated that the applicants ’ rights to land would presumably have been terminated by virtue of Article 32 §§ 1 to 8 of the 1992 Land Code, as they had not returned to their land since May 1992 and had thus failed to use it for two successive years. The Government further claimed that, in any event, the land had been allocated to other individuals in accordance with the laws of the “NKR”. In support of the second claim, they submitted a number of “NKR” land - registry documents from 2000 and 2001.",
                "In regard to the Government ’ s first contention, the Court notes that terminating land rights under Article 32 of the 1992 Land Code necessitated a decision to that effect by the local Soviet of People ’ s Deputies and, moreover, required that the failure to use the land was without good reason. The latter can hardly be said to be the case here in view of the military presence in the relevant territories since 1992/93. In these circumstances, the claim, which amounts to no more than speculation, must be rejected. As to the Government ’ s second contention, it is unclear to which land or possessors the submitted land - registry documents refer. Moreover, the claim seems to contradict the statement that the “NKR” had not adopted any legal act that deprived the applicants of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property. In any event, this issue has already been examined at the admissibility stage in regard to the Court ’ s jurisdiction ratione temporis following a similar claim by the Government. The claim was rejected on the following grounds ( see Chiragov and Others v. Armenia (dec.), no. 13216/05, § 102, 12 February 2012 ):",

The texts of these laws have not been submitted to the Court. In any event, the Court notes that the ‘ NKR ’ is not recognised as a State under international law by any countries or international organisations. Against this background, the invoked laws cannot be considered legally valid for the purposes of the Convention and the applicants cannot be deemed to have lost their alleged rights to the land in question by virtue of these laws (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, §§ 42-47).”"

There is no indication that those rights have been extinguished since – legitimately or otherwise – whether before or after Armenia ’ s ratification of the Convention. Their proprietary rights are thus still valid.

These credits constituted financial assistance which contributed to Armenia ’ s effective control over Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the surrounding territories. As to the Hayastan All ‑ Armenian Fund, the applicants submitted that it could not be seen as a distinct body independent of the government, as it had been established by presidential decree, its Charter designated the Armenian President as President of the Board of Trustees, and that Board otherwise included several of the highest-ranking representatives of the Armenian authorities, Parliament, Constitutional Court and Central Bank.

For example, in August 1993 the Government appointed Mr Serzh Sargsyan, the Minister of Defence of Nagorno-Karabakh, as Minister of Defence of Armenia, and in 1998 Mr Robert Kocharyan became President of Armenia, having previously been the Prime Minister and President of Nagorno-Karabakh.

In their view, effective control implied detailed direction or control over specific operations of the controlled entity, with the capacity to start and stop them as well as to determine their course. Pointing out that extraterritorial jurisdiction was an exception to the principle that a State had jurisdiction over its own territory, the Government maintained that the burden of proving such control was on the applicants, that the burden of proof should be of a high standard, and that they could not discharge this burden, as evidence rather showed that there was no Armenian influence, let alone control, over the “NKR”. The Government was of the opinion that Al-Skeini (cited above) was not relevant to the present circumstances as that judgment relied on “State agent authority and control” which did not apply to the facts of the present case. Furthermore, the merely supportive role played by Armenia in relation to the “NKR” was fundamentally different from the number of Turkish soldiers involved in northern Cyprus or the size of the Russian military arsenal present in Transdniestria (as established in Loizidou and Ilaşcu and Others, both cited above), and did not, under any reasonable definition, amount to effective control."

The military actions were actually against the interests of the Government, which was at the time negotiating a ceasefire agreement with the Azerbaijani leaders; a meeting had been held from 8 to 9 May in Tehran.

Furthermore, the Armenian authorities had not adopted any legal acts or programmes or taken other official steps to get involved in the military actions, which had been entirely carried out by the “NKR” defence force, established in early 1992 following the enactment of the “NKR” Law on conscription. It had been assisted by the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories as well as volunteers of Armenian origin from various countries. Armenia had only been involved in the war in so far as it had defended itself against Azerbaijani attacks on its territory within the recognised borders of Armenia.

In the district of Lachin there were no military units at all, as Lachin was at a considerable distance from the “NKR” border with Azerbaijan and there was therefore no need to keep units there. It could not be ruled out that some Armenian nationals may have served in the “NKR” defence force on a contractual and voluntary basis. Moreover, according to the 1994 Agreement on Military Cooperation between the Governments of the Republic of Armenia and the “ Republic of Nagorno ‑ Karabakh ” (“the 1994 Military Agreement”), draftees from Armenia, upon their consent, may perform their military service in the “NKR” and vice versa, as well as participate in military exercises organised in the “NKR” or in Armenia. The legal proceedings involving Armenian conscripts who had served in the “NKR” had a simple explanation: under the Agreement, criminal charges against Armenian conscripts were dealt with by the Armenian prosecutors and any such charges against Karabakhi conscripts were dealt with by the “NKR” authorities. However, only a small number of Armenian volunteer conscripts had served in Nagorno-Karabakh where they had moreover been under the direct command of the “NKR” defence force."

Armenia had not given any economic help to the “NKR” other than, for several years, providing the “NKR” with long-term loans for the implementation of specific projects, including the rebuilding of schools and other educational institutions and the provision of financial assistance to the families of soldiers killed in action. Such help had been provided by other countries as well. Moreover, the Fund played a great role in the development of the “NKR”. Its main mission was to provide financial assistance to Armenia and the “NKR”, using resources collected by the Armenian diaspora. While there were Armenian representatives on the Board of Trustees, the majority of the Board ’ s members were from the Armenian diaspora and the “NKR”. The Fund ’ s agenda was not set by the government; often the donors themselves decided to which projects their money should go. The only governmental assistance to the Fund was the provision of rent-free offices in a government building in Yerevan. Thus, it was not an instrument of control, but a non-political, charitable organisation, which had provided USD 111 million to the “NKR” for building schools and hospitals, reconstructing roads and villages, assisting with cultural events and subsidising work and education for the poor. Resources were also provided by other funds and international organisations. Charity and international investments in the “NKR” annually accounted for USD 20-30 million and 30-40 million respectively."

It exercised control and jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh and the territories surrounding it. Only the laws and other legal acts of the “NKR” were applied on these territories, and it was normal for the “NKR” to have borrowed or adopted some laws from Armenia. The “NKR” had its own court system which operated entirely independently. Political elections were held in the “NKR”, and the fact that some individuals had been in high political office in both the “NKR” and Armenia was nothing out of the ordinary in the early days of both countries ’ independence. Armenia ’ s political support was limited to taking part in the settlement negotiations conducted within the framework of the Minsk Group, with a view to regulating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. “NKR” passports were issued to its citizens, who had political rights and civil duties on the basis of their citizenship. Armenian passports had been issued only to some residents of Nagorno-Karabakh so as to enable them to travel abroad. Several currencies, not only the Armenian dram, were used in the “NKR”."

Evidence since 2002 demonstrated that Armenia and the “NKR” were friendly countries, with much in common and with close economic and social links, a military alliance and a shared ethnicity. Armenia had had some influence in so far as it had, from time to time, given financial and other assistance to the “NKR”.

They invoked statements by various international and non-governmental organisations and the US Department of State, as well as many political leaders in claiming that, at the beginning of the 1990s, Armenian forces, fighting beside separatist Karabakhi forces, had occupied Nagorno-Karabakh as well as Lachin and the other surrounding territories and that these territories continued to be occupied by Armenia, which had soldiers stationed there. In the latter respect, they referred to Harutyunyan v. Armenia (no. 36549/03, ECHR 2007-III ) and Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan v. Armenia ( ( dec.), nos. 36894/04 and 3521/07, 11 October 2007 ). The “NKR” was not an independent State, as claimed by the respondent Government, but a subordinate local administration surviving by virtue of the military and other support afforded by Armenia. Allegedly, it was not conceivable that the “NKR” defence force would exist in any recognisable form without the extensive support of Armenia, expressed, for example, in weapons, equipment, training and, above all, the constant provision of a highly significant percentage – if not an actual majority – of soldiers based in the occupied territories."

Furthermore, economic aid provided by Armenia was essential for the “NKR”. The Government referred to the Fund, which allegedly had to be seen as an organ of the Armenian State in relation to the aid given to Nagorno-Karabakh. The Fund had had a significant impact in the “NKR”, not just financially but also socially. Allegedly, it was carried by political will, reinforcing Nagorno-Karabakh ’ s economic dependency on Armenia and further integrating the “NKR” into Armenia.

The principles have been set out in several cases, including Ilaşcu and Others (cited above, §§ 311-19), Al-Skeini and Others (cited above, §§ 130-39) and Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia ([GC], nos. 43370/04 and 2 others, 19 October 2012 ). The relevant passages of Catan and Others read as follows.",
                "“103. The Court has established a number of clear principles in its case-law under Article 1. Thus, as provided by this Article, the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State is confined to ‘ securing ’ ( ‘ reconnaître ’ in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own ‘ jurisdiction ’ (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 86, Series A no. 161, and Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others [GC] (dec.), no. 52207/99, § 66, ECHR 2001-XII). ‘ Jurisdiction ’ under Article 1 is a threshold criterion. The exercise of jurisdiction is a necessary condition for a Contracting State to be able to be held responsible for acts or omissions imputable to it which give rise to an allegation of the infringement of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 311, ECHR 2004-VII, and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 130, 7 July 2011 ).",
                "104. A State ’ s jurisdictional competence under Article 1 is primarily territorial (see Soering, cited above, § 86; Banković and Others, cited above, §§ 61 [and] 67; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 131). Jurisdiction is presumed to be exercised normally throughout the State ’ s territory ( see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312; Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 139, ECHR 2004-II). Conversely, acts of the Contracting States performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 only in exceptional cases ( see Banković and Others, cited above, § 67, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above § 131).",
                "105. To date, the Court has recognised a number of exceptional circumstances capable of giving rise to the exercise of jurisdiction by a Contracting State outside its own territorial boundaries. In each case, the question whether exceptional circumstances exist which require and justify a finding by the Court that the State was exercising jurisdiction extra-territorially must be determined with reference to the particular facts ( see Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 132).",
                "106. One exception to the principle that jurisdiction under Article 1 is limited to a State ’ s own territory occurs when, as a consequence of lawful or unlawful military action, a Contracting State exercises effective control of an area outside that national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State ’ s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration ( see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 62, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 76, ECHR 2001-IV; Banković and Others, cited above, § 70; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 314-16; Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138). Where the fact of such domination over the territory is established, it is not necessary to determine whether the Contracting State exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration. The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the Contracting State ’ s military and other support entails that State ’ s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights ( see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, §§ 76-77, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138).",
                "107. It is a question of fact whether a Contracting State exercises effective control over an area outside its own territory. In determining whether effective control exists, the Court will primarily have reference to the strength of the State ’ s military presence in the area (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, §§ 16 and 56, and Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 387). Other indicators may also be relevant, such as the extent to which its military, economic and political support for the local subordinate administration provides it with influence and control over the region (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 388-94, and Al ‑ Skeini and Others, cited above, § 139).",

More significantly, in December 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR and the Nagorno-Karabakh Regional Council adopted a Joint Resolution on the reunification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and, in January 1990, a joint budget was established.

For instance, the UN Security Council Resolutions adopted in 1993, while expressing serious concern at the tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, referred to invasion and occupation by “local Armenian forces” and urged Armenia to exert its influence on “the Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh region” (see paragraph 59 above). Nevertheless, the HRW report ( see paragraph 60 above ) attests to the involvement of the Armenian armed forces at this point in time.

Similar demands were made by the UN General Assembly in March 2008 ( see paragraph 67 above ) and by the European Parliament in April 2012 ( see paragraph 70 above ). In January 2005 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, noting the occupation by Armenian forces of “considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan”, reaffirmed that independence and secession of a territory may not be achieved in the wake of “the de facto annexation of such territory to another state” ( see paragraph 64 above ). The International Crisis Group ( ICG ) report of September 2005 concluded, on the basis of statements by Armenian soldiers and officials, that “ [ t ] here is a high degree of integration between the forces of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh” ( see paragraph 65 above ).

Of even greater significance is the speech given by the incumbent President of Armenia, Mr Serzh Sargsyan, in January 2013, to leaders of the Ministry of Defence, in which he declared that the goal of Armenian foreign policy was to achieve legal recognition of the victory attained by “our Army” in the Nagorno-Karabakh war ( see paragraph 72 above ).

The Court need not solve this issue as, based on the numerous reports and statements presented above, it finds it established that Armenia, through its military presence and the provision of military equipment and expertise, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date. This military support has been – and continues to be – decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the territories in issue, and the evidence, not least the Agreement, convincingly shows that the Armenian armed forces and the “NKR” are highly integrated."

In regard to the legislation and the judiciary, there is further evidence of integration. The Government have acknowledged that several laws of the “NKR” have been adopted from Armenian legislation. More importantly, the facts of Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan ( see paragraph 76 above ) show not only the presence of Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh but also the operation of Armenian law - enforcement agents and the exercise of jurisdiction by Armenian courts on that territory.

According to the ICG, relying on official sources, the loan made up 67.3% of the “NKR” budget in 2001 and 56.9% in 2004.

As mentioned already in regard to the issue of the exhaustion of domestic remedies, Armenia ’ s position in the Minsk Group negotiations – that the return of displaced persons can be considered only after a final settlement of the status of the “NKR” has been agreed upon – referred to displaced persons as a group and did not concern who could obtain entry visas if they had a legitimate reason to enter the “NKR” or Armenia.

The Government further asserted that the capture of Lachin – as well as Shusha /Shushi – was a lawful act of self-defence against war crimes committed by Azerbaijan, in particular military attacks on Stepanakert.

The Government claimed that the applicants had had effective administrative and judicial remedies at their disposal, both in Armenia and the “NKR”, which did not differentiate between displaced persons and people of another status. As regards the remedies in the “NKR”, the Government referred to the Court ’ s conclusions in Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, § 98) and maintained that the remedies of an internationally unrecognised entity should be exhausted unless their inexistence or ineffectiveness could be proved. The Government further referred to the arguments and the examples of cases presented in relation to the issue of exhaustion of the domestic remedies and asserted that the applicants had failed to make use of the available remedies and had not submitted any evidence that the remedies were inexistent or ineffective.",

The Court reiterates its above finding that the Government have failed to discharge the burden of proving the availability to the applicants of a remedy capable of providing redress in respect of their Convention complaints and offering reasonable prospects of success (see paragraph 120 above). For the same reasons, the Court finds that there was no available effective remedy in respect of the denial of access to the applicants ’ possessions and homes in the district of Lachin."

The applicants submitted that, if they had been ethnically Armenian and Christian rather than Azerbaijani Kurds and Muslim, they would not have been forcibly displaced from their homes by the Armenian-backed forces. They referred to the report by Mr David Atkinson and the Resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly, according to which “the military action, and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono ‑ ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing” (see paragraph 64 above). Alternatively, the applicants submitted that they had been subjected to indirect discrimination by Armenia, since the actions taken by the Armenian military and the Armenian-backed Karabakh forces had disproportionately affected Azerbaijani Kurds, who were individuals belonging to an identifiable group."

In any event, the applicants had not been subjected to discriminatory treatment, because the military actions in Lachin had been aimed merely at opening a “humanitarian corridor” between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and had not been directed against the residents of the district, whatever their ethnic or religious affiliation. Moreover, Kurds had never been subjected to discrimination in the Republic of Armenia or the “NKR” and the population of approximately 1,500 Kurds living in Armenia at present actively participated in social and political life and enjoyed all rights.",

They further submitted that the applicants and other Azerbaijani internally displaced persons were still prevented from returning to their homes and possessions, while Armenians were being offered various incentives (including free housing, money, livestock and tax benefits) to settle in the territory, especially in Lachin.

The Court ’ s findings of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention in the present case relate to a general situation which involves the flight of practically all Azerbaijani citizens, presumably most of them Muslims, from Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories, and their inability to return to these territories. The applicants ’ complaint under Article 14 of the Convention is thus intrinsically linked to the other complaints. Consequently, in view of the violations found under the other provisions, the Court considers that no separate issue arises under Article 14 (see, for instance, Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 199; Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no. 46347/99, § 36, 22 December 2005; and Catan and Others, cited above, § 160).",
