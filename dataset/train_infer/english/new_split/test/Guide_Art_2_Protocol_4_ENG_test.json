In order to be compatible with the guarantees of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, the impugned restriction should be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v. Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A, p. 19, § 39) or, where the restriction applies to particular areas only, be “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4."

The Court, however, is not persuaded that the City Court's judgment laid down a reliable factual basis for this assessment because its findings of fact appear inconsistent and fraught with contradictions. For example, the City Court found that reinforced controls of vehicles on 19 June 1999 had been introduced by a police order (no. 68) which was only issued two days later, on 21 June 1999. It also found that the applicant had refused to show his passport or some other identity document. However, if the applicant did not wait in the queue for his turn and left of his own will, then the failure to produce documents could not be held against him. Alternatively, if the police asked for his documents, that suggests, by converse implication, that it was his turn in the queue or else that he was granted priority treatment. Furthermore, the City Court established that the applicant had shown his advocate's card but failed to explain the relevance of its finding that the card had been issued in Grozny rather than in Nalchik ( a finding which is, moreover, refuted by a copy of the card produced by the applicant in evidence ). The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kabardino-Balkaria of 21 September 1999 did nothing to eliminate these discrepancies."

It finds that the traffic police at the Urukh checkpoint prevented the applicant from crossing the administrative border between two Russian regions, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. There has therefore been a restriction on the applicant's right to liberty of movement within the territory of the respondent State, within the meaning of Article 2 § 1 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.",

Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A, p. 19, § 39) or, where the restriction applies to particular areas only, be “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4."

The inquiries carried out by the prosecutor's office and by the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior established that the restriction in issue had been imposed by an oral order given by the Deputy Head of the Public Safety Police of the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior, Colonel Efendiyev. It appears that the order was not properly formalised or recorded in some other traceable way, enabling the Court to carry out an assessment of its contents, scope and legal basis. Indeed, the reference to section 11 ( 22 ) of the Police Act appeared for the first time in the Government's submissions in the proceedings before the Court. In any event, in the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the order amounted to a violation of the constitutional right to liberty of movement enshrined in Article 27 of the Russian Constitution."

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been relied on both on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 as well, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 89, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 26, § 67 )."

As, in the Government's submission, a person's ethnic origin is not listed anywhere in Russian identity documents, the order barred the passage not only of any person who actually was of Chechen ethnicity, but also of those who were merely perceived as belonging to that ethnic group. It has not been claimed that representatives of other ethnic groups were subject to similar restrictions ( see, in particular, paragraph 51 above).

Discrimination on account of one's actual or perceived ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination (see the definitions adopted by the United Nations and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance – paragraphs 33 and 34 above). Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145)."

There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).

It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force.

Those measures were indissociable from each other and affected the exercise of his right under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see the case-law cited in paragraph 78 below).

They referred to the case of Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 48, Series A no. 28), in which the Court acknowledged that democratic societies were threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism and that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

The Government emphasised that the applicants had gained access to State secrets through their employment and had voluntarily accepted a temporary restriction on their rights, including the right to travel abroad (here they referred, by way of comparison, to Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

The Government acknowledged that the laws of a majority of member States did not explicitly impose a restriction on the right to travel abroad for individuals aware of State secrets. They alleged however that many countries had put in place “a secret system of measures designed to ensure State control over [such] individuals”. In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

As regards Russia ’ s commitment to cease to restrict international travel of persons aware of State secrets, the Government submitted that “the intention did not imply a full repeal of the restrictions, especially since the ‘ generally accepted ’ restrictions are not set out in any document”. At present, it could only be expected that the measures for the protection of State interests would be proportionate to the aim pursued and that the national law would be further developed with a possibility of gradually repealing such restrictions at some future point in time. Lastly, the Government pointed out that on 22 June 2011 the Interagency Commission had established a working group to explore common approaches to problematic issues relating to travel restrictions on individuals aware of State secrets. Its task was to develop methodology for determining the specific duration of the restriction, taking into account the extent of their awareness of State secrets and the exhaustive list of criteria for restricting the right to travel abroad. The working group had drafted two federal laws, one Presidential decree and two Government resolutions which were in the process of being approved by the executive authorities."

The applicants submitted that Russia ’ s failure to implement its accession commitment relating to the lifting of the travel ban on individuals aware of State secrets amounted to a structural problem. That problem had been highlighted in the Court ’ s judgments in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, which had not been executed to date as regards general measures. The situation had not changed after the adoption by the Russian Constitutional Court of judgment no. 14-P, dated 7 June 2012, which had upheld the validity of the travel ban. The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia ’ s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments."

The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 60 above). The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50). The Russian Federation became a member State of the Council of Europe on 28 February 1996. However, it has not fulfilled that specific accession commitment to date, that is to say for more than twenty - two years."

It found that a restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his own country was not necessary in a democratic society and amounted to a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (§§ 44-52). On 10 February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, §§ 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (§ 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph 28 above)."

Neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the Court did the Russian authorities produce any evidence in support of their claim that the applicant was a Georgian citizen. The registration of the applicant ’ s residence in Tbilisi dating back to the early 1990s had no automatic bearing on determination of her citizenship under either Russian or Georgian law. As the Government ’ s allegation that the applicant was a Georgian citizen has no evidentiary basis, the denunciation, by the Russian Federation, of the Bishkek Agreement on visa-free movement could not have affected the lawfulness of her residence on Russian territory."

Only after that date were they to be considered stateless persons (see paragraph 24 above). The applicant claimed that she belonged to that category and the Government did not produce any evidence to the contrary. It follows that at the material time, in early December 2000, the requirement to have a residence permit, established in the 1981 USSR Law governing the status of foreign citizens and stateless persons, did not apply to her because she was neither a foreign citizen nor a stateless person (see paragraph 25 above). In any event, both the 1993 Law on the liberty of movement and freedom to choose residence and the Government Resolution of 12 March 1997 established that the procedure for registration of residence of “former USSR citizens” should be the same as that for Russian citizens (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above)."

They claimed that the applicant, who had arrived from Georgia, had failed to take any steps to determine her citizenship and to make her residence in Russia lawful, such as confirming her Georgian citizenship or applying for Russian citizenship. They stated that the applicant ’ s situation had been governed by the 1981 USSR Law on the legal status of foreign citizens in the USSR and by the 1991 Rules on the stay of foreign citizens in the USSR. Pursuant to sections 5 and 32 of the 1981 USSR law, the applicant, as a stateless person, should have obtained a residence permit from the Ministry of the Interior. The Government concurrently claimed that, after entry visas had been introduced for Georgian citizens from 5 December 2000, the applicant could only have been lawfully resident in Russia on 25 December 2000 if she had crossed the border with a valid Russian visa in her national passport."

She continued to hold citizenship of the former USSR and had never acquired Georgian citizenship. Consequently, she had not been required to obtain an entry visa as a Georgian citizen. In any event, she had not crossed the Russian border in 2000 or later. As to the Government ’ s reliance on the 1981 USSR Law and the 1991 Rules, section 1 of that Law stated that it did not apply to USSR citizens, which the applicant had remained, and it had therefore not applied to her. In fact, until a new Russian Law on the legal status of foreign citizens was adopted on 25 June 2002, Russia had no legislation imposing an obligation on citizens of the former USSR to obtain residence permits as a condition of their lawful residence in Russia. Thus, at the material time she had been lawfully present in the Russian Federation."

The status of citizens of the former USSR in the Russian Federation had ceased to be recognised only on 31 December 2000. After that date they were to be considered as stateless persons and subjected to the same legal regime as foreign citizens. The third- party intervener noted that before 1 November 2002 there had been no notion of temporary residence permits in Russian legislation, and registration at a permanent place of residence could not by its nature be regarded as such a permit. Failure to register at a place of residence could lead to a fine, but it did not affect the lawfulness of the residence of citizens of the former USSR in Russia per se."

The contention that, as a Georgian citizen, the applicant should have possessed an entry visa appeared for the first time in the comments on the applicant ’ s statement of claim and was subsequently upheld by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 12 et seq. above)."

In so far as the Russian authorities claimed that the applicant required an entry visa as a Georgian citizen, the Court observes that the applicant remained a citizen of the former USSR. She denied that she had ever acquired Georgian citizenship. Neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the Court did the Russian authorities produce any evidence in support of their claim that the applicant was a Georgian citizen. The registration of the applicant ’ s residence in Tbilisi dating back to the early 1990s had no automatic bearing on determination of her citizenship under either Russian or Georgian law. As the Government ’ s allegation that the applicant was a Georgian citizen has no evidentiary basis, the denunciation, by the Russian Federation, of the Bishkek Agreement on visa-free movement could not have affected the lawfulness of her residence on Russian territory."

The Government concurrently maintained that the applicant had been a stateless person – having acquired no other citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union – and had therefore been required to hold a residence permit in accordance with the 1981 USSR Law on foreign citizens. The Court notes at the outset that this argument first appeared in the Government ’ s observations of 26 March 2004 and that it had not been relied upon in refusing the application for residence registration in the domestic proceedings. In any event, the Court does not consider this argument convincing for the following reasons."

Only after that date were they to be considered stateless persons (see paragraph 24 above). The applicant claimed that she belonged to that category and the Government did not produce any evidence to the contrary. It follows that at the material time, in early December 2000, the requirement to have a residence permit, established in the 1981 USSR Law governing the status of foreign citizens and stateless persons, did not apply to her because she was neither a foreign citizen nor a stateless person (see paragraph 25 above). In any event, both the 1993 Law on the liberty of movement and freedom to choose residence and the Government Resolution of 12 March 1997 established that the procedure for registration of residence of “former USSR citizens” should be the same as that for Russian citizens (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above)."

Article 6 § 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their judgments, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 199 4, § 29, Series A no. 303-A). Even though a domestic court has a certain margin of appreciation when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of the parties ’ submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, § 36, 1 July 2003 ). A further function of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that they have been heard. Moreover, a reasoned decision affords a party the possibility to appeal against it, as well as the possibility of having the decision reviewed by an appellate body.

The District Court subsequently directed that the reference to those submissions be added to the hearing record (see paragraph 17 above). It follows that the flat owner ’ s consent was validly produced in the domestic proceedings and its existence was acknowledged by the District Court, which gave no reasons whatsoever for its finding that there existed a dispute between the applicant and the flat owner.

The Court is not convinced that this discrepancy could have been the result of a mere difference in terms because the text of the “treaty on visa-based exchanges” was never produced in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts appear to have taken the reference to it from the passport department ’ s submissions. Furthermore, the Court finds it anomalous that the District Court relied on a treaty governing the conditions of entry and stay for Georgian citizens without giving any reasons for the assumption that the applicant was a Georgian citizen.

As to the President of Georgia's failure to follow the Rules on the Exercise of the Right of Pardon, the Supreme Court found that the decree of 13 May 1998 contained the working rules and regulations of the Office of the President of the Republic and that failure to observe them could under no circumstances prevent the Georgian President exercising his constitutional right of pardon."

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

At most, the prosecuting authorities may judge it necessary to set the criminal process in motion in respect of matters that have thereby been brought to their attention. In the instant case, on 25 March 2003, following a request for the reopening of the proceedings by the civil party, the General Prosecutor's Office of Georgia found that the parliamentary committee's findings in its report of 26 September 2002 did not constitute new factual or legal circumstances that could warrant reopening the applicant's case (see paragraph 89 above).",

Moreover, since Georgia is not a federal State, the Ajarian Autonomous Republic is not part of a federation. It forms an entity which, like others (the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia and, before 1991, the Autonomous District of South Ossetia), must have an autonomous status (see paragraphs 108- 10 above), which is a different matter. Besides, even if an implied federal clause similar in content to that of Article 28 of the American Convention were found to exist in the European Convention (which is impossible in practice), it could not be construed as releasing the federal State from all responsibility, since it requires the federal State to “immediately take suitable measures, in accordance with its constitution ..., to the end that the [states forming part of the federation] may adopt appropriate provisions for the fulfillment of [ the] Convention”."

The position in the present case is quite different: no State apart from Georgia exercised control – and therefore had jurisdiction – over the Ajarian Autonomous Republic and indeed it has not been suggested otherwise before the Court, quite the opposite (see paragraphs 132- 36 above). The present application also differs from that in Banković and Others, which was distinguishable from the two preceding cases, in that the respondent States – which were parties to the Convention and members of NATO – did not exercise “overall control” over the territory concerned.

The right to freedom of movement could only be limited in exceptional situations, namely in order to protect national security, public order, public health and morals or the rights and freedoms of others. None of those exceptions had been established or even claimed in the applicants ’ case. The court observed that the first applicant offered good material conditions to the child in Germany, that the child had adapted well during his stay there before March 2010, that the first applicant was going to specialise in European law in the Wurtzburg University and that the second applicant enjoyed considerable care and attention from his mother. The court also held that V.P. ’ s arguments about his access rights were unrelated to the present proceedings; those arguments had to do with the enforcement of a future court decision in which the exercise of the parental rights in respect of the second applicant were to be definitively determined.

The court relied on its well established and binding case-law according to which permission for a child ’ s unlimited travel abroad with one parent only could not be granted because, as a matter of principle, that could never be in the best interest of the child. The reasons were more specifically that there was a risk that the requesting parent could take the child to countries which were in a state of war or in which there was a high risk of natural calamities, and thus endanger the child ’ s well-being while depriving the State of the possibility to ensure his or her protection. Such permission could be granted, when that was in the interest of the child, in respect of concrete destinations and for a limited period of time.

She pointed out that she had consistently facilitated V.P. ’ s access to the child in accordance with his contact rights determined in the divorce proceedings. She submitted that, because she could not take the second applicant with her to Germany while she was pursuing her studies there, both her child and she were deprived of personal contact with each other. She claimed this negatively affected their family life as she was practically deprived of the possibility to raise her child while the exercise of parental rights had been granted to her. She submitted that her doctoral studies in Germany, which were to last three years as of the fall of 2012, would give her the flexibility necessary for her taking care of her child, given that she could do most of her work from home.

Furthermore, the applicants alleged that the Supreme Court of Cassation did not carry out a proportionality analysis of all relevant circumstances in its decision of 26 June 2012. Instead, they claimed, the highest court confined itself to a mere reference to its invariable practice in similar cases in application of the relevant legal provisions under the Family Code 2009 and the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998.

The phrase “ in accordance with the law ” does not merely refer back to domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be clear, accessible and foreseeable. Furthermore, the interference must pursue aims that are legitimate under paragraph 2 of Article 8 and can be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”. Necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see W. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, § 60, Series A no. 121).

It is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating disputes related to contact, residence or travel; it has to rather review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation. In assessing those decisions, the Court must ascertain more specifically whether the domestic courts conducted an in-depth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of factors, in particular of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature, and whether they made a balanced and reasonable assessment of the respective interests of each person, with a constant concern for determining what the best solution would be for the child (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.

In addition, section 76(9) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Acts specifically entitles the police to disallow a minor ’ s travel in case of absence of related parental consent and stipulates that, where such consent is missing, the matter is to be decided by the civil courts. It is true that, as the applicants pointed out, neither of those provisions differentiates between the reasons for or duration of travel, nor in respect of which of the parents is the primary care-provider for the child.

The Court first observes that the applicants complained that the relevant law itself, applied by the national courts in the present case, imposed a disproportionate limitation on their right to respect for their family life. This was because the law contained a condition in operation of which both parents ’ consent had to be present for any type and duration of travel abroad by their child. In the Court ’ s view, this requirement as such does not appear to impose either an unreasonable or a disproportionate limitation on the applicants ’ right to family life, given that the State is called upon to ensure a fair balance between the competing interests at stake – those of the child, of the two parents, and of public order (see, among many others, Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, § 62). This is especially the case, considering that the Court has been called a number of times to pronounce on complaints brought by a parent whose child had been taken abroad by the other parent without the knowledge or agreement of the former. In those cases, referring to the requirements of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the Court has repeatedly found that the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other ’ s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life under Article 8 even when the relationship between the parents has broken down ( see, on the one hand, Karrer v.

It relied on its well established case-law, according to which permission for a child ’ s unlimited travel abroad with one parent only could not be granted. This was because, as a matter of principle, that could never be in the best interest of the child, given that the requesting parent could take him or her to a place of high risk, and thus endanger his or her well-being while depriving the State of the possibility to protect the child. The Court observes that, in its examination of the request for travel by the second applicant, the Supreme Court of Cassation did not refer to the fact that the father had had a restraining order imposed on him in the past and that, in any event, he was not in practice taking care of the child even when the mother was abroad to pursue her studies. Similarly, in assessing the child ’ s best interests the highest national court did not make any reference to elements of a psychological, emotional, material or medical nature. Thus, the court did not conduct an evaluation of the mother ’ s qualities and the type of care that she had been providing for the child. Nor did the court look into whether there was any real and specific risk for the child if he travelled with his mother abroad. Furthermore, the court overlooked the information that the child had adapted well to a kindergarten in Germany and that his mother had the financial means to offer him adequate living conditions there, or that the father ’ s access rights had been determined in a manner compatible with the child ’ s living with his mother in Germany (see paragraph 1 6 above)."

Although the first applicant had made it clear in the evidence and oral arguments presented to the court that she wished to take the child to Germany to live with her while she was pursuing her studies, the court based its refusal on a technical error made by her when submitting the application and, more specifically, her failure to specify in writing Germany as the country of destination to which travel was requested.

Furthermore, although the request was made on 29 April 2010, that is to say at a time when the courts had to hear it in rapid proceedings (see paragraph 27 above), they did not do so. Neither did the courts handle the request during the proceedings before them with the swiftness required by the circumstances in the applicants ’ case. Bearing in mind that the applicants were living in two different countries while the first applicant pursued her studies there, the time the courts took to rule on the request for travel had a serious negative impact on the applicants ’ ability to live together and contributed to the related difficulties experienced by them. In particular, such a situation of prolonged separation was not respectful of their right to family life, given that the child ’ s healthy and harmonious development required his mother ’ s on-going involvement which she could not personally provide and that the mother had to endure the emotional burden of not being in a position to care for her child on a daily basis.

As the Burgomaster had been issuing eight-hour prohibition orders since 1983 and fourteen-day ones since 1989, it could no longer be argued that an exceptional situation prevailed.

It is relevant in this context that at the time of the decision appealed against it was not possible to solve the problem in question through a municipal regulation. There was not at that time – and there is not now – any relevant provision in a municipal by-law, nor is any other sufficient legal means available.",

This leads the Division to hold that it cannot be stated that the defendant could not reasonably make use of the powers granted him by section 219 of the Municipality Act.",

From the point of view of legal certainty and legitimacy of action by public authority, a regulation provided by a municipal by-law seems preferable to a measure based on the defendant's emergency powers. It appears from the case file that the defendant had already prepared the draft of an appropriate provision, which, however, was never incorporated into the General Municipal By-Law because the method used at present, which was decided on in consultation between the defendant, the police and the prosecuting authorities [ verweerder, politie en justitie ] with regard to the fourteen-day prohibition orders, was considered extraordinarily effective. The Division is, however, of the opinion that the presumed effectiveness of an emergency measure coupled with the prosecuting policy of the prosecution authorities [ Openbaar Ministerie ] do not constitute a reason not to make appropriate provision at the municipal level. The Division considers that the defendant, in assessing whether there is an exceptional situation within the meaning of section 219 of the Municipality Act (now section 175 of the Municipality Act), may, in principle, no longer rely on the lack of an appropriate provision in a municipal by-law, in view of the length of time this drugs-related nuisance [ drugsoverlast ] has already prevailed, causing it to display structural aspects, if the possibility of issuing fourteen-day prohibition orders is not now provided for in a by-law enacted by the Local Council within a reasonable time.”",

However, the situation threatens all the time to become unbearable.",

This bridge was occupied by representatives of a new phenomenon, namely, multiple drugs use.",

It held, however, that the mere fact that two and a half years had passed since the Burgomaster had declared an emergency situation – the case related to the Burgomaster's instruction of 17 October 1989 – was not sufficient per se to justify the conclusion that an exceptional situation no longer existed. It also held, in the same judgment, that Article 6 of the Convention did not apply to eight-hour prohibition orders because such orders were not given by way of penal sanction but were in the nature of a measure aimed at preserving public order. Nor did such orders violate Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, since they were “in accordance with law” and “necessary in a democratic society” for “the maintenance of ordre public ”.

Moreover, since issuing the instruction in 1983 the Burgomaster had never made public any decision declaring that an exceptional situation existed in any particular area.

In addition, the police had given him warning, both orally and in writing, of the likely consequences. The issuing of a fourteen-day prohibition order could not therefore have come as a surprise to the applicant. The method chosen to warn persons in the applicant's position was well adapted to the particular section of the public targeted by the measure. As to the argument put forward on the applicant's behalf to the effect that the Burgomaster's instructions ought to have been published, the Government observed that these were internal instructions to the police and not aimed at informing the public.

Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."

However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."

The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

However, the summary suggested that the officers be reprimanded not for carrying out unlawful orders but for presenting contradictory versions of the events to various authorities. The thrust of this reprimand demonstrated, in the applicant's opinion, that the Minister was not concerned about a violation of human rights, but rather about the police officers'“inability to lie consistently”."

According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

It also found that the applicant had refused to show his passport or some other identity document. However, if the applicant did not wait in the queue for his turn and left of his own will, then the failure to produce documents could not be held against him. Alternatively, if the police asked for his documents, that suggests, by converse implication, that it was his turn in the queue or else that he was granted priority treatment. Furthermore, the City Court established that the applicant had shown his advocate's card but failed to explain the relevance of its finding that the card had been issued in Grozny rather than in Nalchik ( a finding which is, moreover, refuted by a copy of the card produced by the applicant in evidence ).

France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 89, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 26, § 67 )."

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction.

A law which confers a discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law (see Khlyustov, cited above, § 70, and Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 88, Series A no. 61).",

It observes, however, that in Labita (cited above, § 194) it found that the preventive measures were based on Acts nos. 14 23/1956, 575/1965, 327/1988 and 55/1990 and were therefore “in accordance with law” within the meaning of the third paragraph of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. In S.M. v. Italy (cited above, § 26) the Act in issue was examined in the light of the Court of Appeal ’ s decision acknowledging that there had been a procedural defect in the proceedings at first instance. In the Court ’ s view, the mere fact that the District Court ’ s decision had subsequently been quashed had not as such affected the lawfulness of the interference during the prior period. By contrast, in Raimondo and Vito Sante Santoro (both cited above), the Court found that the interference with the applicants ’ liberty of movement had been neither “in accordance with law” nor “necessary” on account of the delay in serving the decision revoking the special supervision (see Raimondo, cited above, § 40) and on account of the unlawful prolongation of the special supervision for a period of two months and twenty-two days without any compensation for the damage sustained (see Vito Sante Santoro, cited above, § 45)."

Neither the individuals to whom preventive measures were applicable (section 1 of the 1956 Act) nor the content of certain of these measures (sections 3 and 5 of the 1956 Act) were defined by law with sufficient precision and clarity. It follows that the Act did not satisfy the foreseeability requirements established in the Court ’ s case-law."

The evidence in the file indicates that he has no fixed and lawful occupation (having declared himself available for employment from February 2008) and that the serious offences under consideration are such as to warrant the conclusion that he has, up until now, derived a significant part of his means of subsistence from criminal activity, by repeatedly resorting to crime either alone or in association with habitual offenders (whether in his municipality of residence or elsewhere). To ensure more thorough monitoring, it is therefore necessary to order not only special police supervision for a period of two years (a measure deemed reasonable on account of the subject ’ s character as clearly emerges from the acts attributed to him), but also compulsory residence for the same duration.”"

                "“(3) The question of preventive measures and associated issues have been brought before this court ever since its inception.",
                "As early as judgment no. 2 of 1956, the court set forth certain important principles, such as the requirement of judicial intervention for all measures restricting personal liberty and the outright rejection of suspicion as a condition for the imposition of such measures, which must be based on specific facts in order to be lawful.",
                "In judgment no. 11 of the same year (1956) the court held that ‘ the great difficulty in ensuring a balance between the two fundamental requirements – not hindering the activity of crime prevention, and guaranteeing respect for the inviolable rights of the human being – appears to have been resolved through recognition of the traditional rights of habeas corpus in the sphere of the principle of strict legality ’. In the same judgment the court further noted: ‘ Consequently, the person concerned cannot in any circumstances be subjected to a deprivation or restriction of his or her (personal) liberty unless the deprivation or restriction is provided for in abstract terms by the law, proceedings have been lawfully instituted to that end and there has been a reasoned decision by a judicial body. ’",
                "The constitutionality of a ‘ system of measures for the prevention of unlawful acts ’ designed to guarantee ‘ orderly and peaceful relations between citizens ’ has been confirmed by subsequent judgments of this court (judgments no. 27 of 1959; no. 45 of 1960; no. 126 of 1962; nos. 23 and 68 of 1964; no. 32 of 1969; and no. 76 of 1970) concerning Articles 13, 16 and 17 and Article 25 § 3 of the Constitution. Sometimes the court has emphasised the parallel with security measures (as provided for in Article 25 § 3 of the Constitution), while at other times it has played it down; sometimes it has confirmed that these two types of measures, both relating to the danger posed to society by the individual, pursue the same aim – crime prevention – while at other times it has on the contrary highlighted the differences between them.",
                "Reference should be made here not only to the observation in judgment no. 27 of 1959 as to the ‘ restricted and qualified ’ nature of the ‘ categories of individuals who may be placed under special supervision (section 1 of the Act) ’ (no. 1423/1956), but also and above all to this court ’ s judgment no. 23 of 1964, in which it declared ill ‑ founded ‘ the question of the constitutionality of section 1 of Act no. 1423 of 27 December 1956, having regard to Articles 13, 25 and 27 of the Constitution ’. The reasoning of that judgment states that ‘ in determining the circumstances (requiring a preventive measure), the legislature should normally use different criteria from those employed to define the constituent elements of a criminal offence; it may also have recourse to elements of presumption, although these must always correspond to objectively identifiable types of behaviour. This does not mean less rigour, but a different type of rigour in defining and adopting preventive measures in comparison with the definition of criminal offences and the imposition of sentences. ’ With regard specifically to subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 1 of Act no. 1423/1956, the court ruled out the possibility that ‘ preventive measures could be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion ’, instead requiring ‘ an objective assessment of the facts revealing the individual ’ s habitual behaviour and standard of living, or specific outward signs of his or her criminal tendencies, which must have been established in such a way as to preclude purely subjective and unverifiable assessments by the authority ordering or applying the preventive measures ’.",
                "(4) In accordance with previous decisions of this court, it should be noted that the constitutionality of preventive measures – in so far as they restrict personal liberty to varying degrees – is necessarily subject to observance of the principle of legality and the existence of judicial safeguards (judgment no. 11 of 1956). These two conditions are equally essential and closely linked, since the absence of one deprives the other of all effect by rendering it purely illusory.",
                "The principle of legality in the context of prevention – that is, the reference to the ‘ cases provided for by law ’ – as deriving from Article 13 or Article 25 § 3 of the Constitution means that although in the majority of cases the application of the measure is linked to a prospective assessment, it must be based on ‘ cases of dangerousness ’ provided for – described – by law, forming both the framework of the judicial examination and the basis of a finding of prospective danger, which can only be lawfully founded on that basis.",
                "Indeed, while jurisdiction in criminal matters means applying the law through an examination of the factual requirements in proceedings affording the necessary safeguards, among them the reliability of evidence, it is undeniable that even in proceedings relating to preventive measures the prospective assessment of dangerousness (which is entrusted to a judge and undoubtedly involves elements of discretion) is necessarily based on factual requirements that are ‘ provided for by law ’ and hence open to judicial scrutiny.",
                "Judicial intervention (and likewise the presence of defence counsel, the need for which has been unequivocally affirmed) in proceedings for the application of preventive measures would have little meaning (or indeed would dangerously distort the judicial function in the sphere of personal liberty) if it did not serve to guarantee the examination, in adversarial proceedings, of the cases provided for by law.",
                "Lastly, it should be noted that the imposition of preventive measures against individuals, which are likewise designed to prevent the commission of (other) offences (and do not always presuppose the commission of a – previous – offence; Article 49 §§ 2 and 4 and Article 115 §§ 2 and 4 of the Criminal Code), to the extent that they can be considered two species of the same genus, is linked to an examination of the cases provided for by law, and the assessment of dangerousness is based on this examination, whether such dangerousness is presumed or must be established in the precise circumstances.",
                "(5) Thus, for preventive measures too the emphasis is on whether or not the factual requirements are defined sufficiently precisely by the law to allow a prospective assessment of the danger to society posed by the individual.",
                "The questions put to this court require it to examine whether the ‘ indicators of danger to society ’ – to use the term commonly employed by legal authors – defined in the impugned legislative provisions are sufficient for the purposes outlined above.",
                "To that end, it should be noted that in terms of precision, the fact that the definition in the legislation refers to a single type of behaviour or a pattern of behaviour is not decisive, since the only thing that can be assessed is an individual ’ s behaviour or conduct in relation to the outside world, as reflected in his or her acts and omissions.",
                "Similarly, for preventive measures it is also crucial that the legislative definition –the cases provided for by law – should make it possible to identify the type(s) of behaviour whose presence in the specific circumstances of the case may form a basis for a prospective, that is to say forward-looking, assessment.",
                "It should also be observed that the types of behaviour required for the imposition of preventive measures – since their aim is to prevent criminal offences – cannot be defined without an explicit or implicit reference to the offence, offences or categories of offences sought to be prevented, so that the description of the type(s) of behaviour concerned becomes all the more crucial in that it can be inferred from their presence in the specific circumstances that there is a reasonable prospect (of the risk) that such offences will be committed by the individuals in question.",
                "(6) In the light of the foregoing considerations, the question of the constitutionality of the final point of section 1(3) of Act no. 1423/1956 must be declared well-founded.",
                "The provision in question (unlike, for example, the first subsection of the same section 1) does not describe one or more types of behaviour, or any ‘ outward conduct ’, that could automatically prompt a judicial examination. The question as to what forms of ‘ outward conduct ’ are relevant is referred to the judge (and prior to that, to the appropriate prosecution and police authorities) when the factual circumstances are being established, even before the examination on the merits. The conditions for the assessment of ‘ criminal tendencies ’ have no conceptual autonomy vis-à-vis the assessment itself. The legal formulation does not therefore have the function of properly defining the circumstances, that is, identifying the particular ‘ cases ’ concerned (as required both by Article 13 and by Article 25 § 3 of the Constitution), but it leaves an uncontrollable margin of discretion to those involved.",
                "... The expression ‘ criminal tendencies ’ used in the 1956 legislation may appear to evoke the concept of ‘ propensity for crime ’ in Article 108 of the Criminal Code, but the comparison does not hold true in substantive terms, since the wording of the latter provision requires the following to be established: an intentional offence against life or limb, motives indicating a particular propensity for crime, and the especially bad character of the guilty party. In the instant case, however, the expression ‘ criminal tendencies ’ is to be understood as a synonym of danger to society, with the result that the entire legislative provision, which allows for the adoption of measures restricting personal liberty without identifying either the requirements or the specific aims justifying them, must be declared unconstitutional.”"

                "80. It reiterates at the outset that in proclaiming the “right to liberty”, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person. Accordingly, it is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement, which are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his or her specific situation and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see Guzzardi, cited above, §§ 92-93; Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 225, ECHR 2012; Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, § 57, ECHR 2012; Stanev v.

Furthermore, an assessment of the nature of the preventive measures provided for by the 1956 Act must consider them “cumulatively and in combination” (see Guzzardi, cited above, § 95)."

As the Court has also held, the requirement to take account of the “type” and “manner of implementation” of the measure in question (ibid., § 92) enables it to have regard to the specific context and circumstances surrounding types of restriction other than the paradigm of confinement in a cell. Indeed, the context in which the measure is taken is an important factor, since situations commonly occur in modern society where the public may be called on to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of the common good (see, mutatis mutandis, Austin and Others, cited above, § 59)."

The Convention institutions ’ body of case-law concerning preventive measures imposed against individuals dates back to the Commission ’ s decision of 5 October 1977 in Guzzardi v. Italy (no. 7960/77, unreported). The applicant in that case alleged that an order for his compulsory residence in the district of Force amounted to a deprivation of liberty. In dismissing his complaint, the Commission concluded that the conditions for the implementation of the compulsory residence order imposed on him, together with the associated obligations, did not entail any deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention but solely restrictions on his liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence."

Subsequently, in a separate case brought by the same applicant, the Court referred to the above-mentioned Commission decision in noting that special supervision accompanied by an order for compulsory residence in a specified district did not of itself come within the scope of Article 5 (see Guzzardi, judgment cited above, § 94). However, it concluded that in view of the particular circumstances of the case, the applicant had been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 and could therefore rely on the guarantees under that provision. The applicant, who was suspected of belonging to a “band of mafiosi”, had been forced to live on an island within an (unfenced) area of 2.5 sq. km, mainly together with other residents in a similar situation and supervisory staff. The requirement to live on the island was accompanied by other restrictions similar to the measures imposed on Mr de Tommaso. The Court attached particular significance to the extremely small size of the area where the applicant had been confined, the almost permanent supervision to which he had been subjected and the fact that it had been almost completely impossible for him to make social contacts ( ibid., § 95)."

Such consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30; Kokkinakis v.

Accordingly, the Court is called upon to examine whether the Act was foreseeable as regards the individuals to whom the preventive measures were applicable (section 1 of the 1956 Act), in the light of the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law."

                "116. In this connection, the Court notes that the Italian Constitutional Court set aside the law in respect of one category of individuals which it found not to be defined in sufficient detail, namely those “whose outward conduct gives good reason to believe that they have criminal tendencies” (see judgment no. 177 of 1980, paragraph 55 above). The relevant provision was no longer in force at the time when the impugned measures were applied to the applicant. In respect of all other categories of individuals to whom the preventive measures are applicable, the Constitutional Court has come to the conclusion that Act no. 1423/1956 contained a sufficiently detailed description of the types of conduct that were held to represent a danger to society. It has found that simply belonging to one of the categories of individuals referred to in section 1 of the Act was not a sufficient ground for imposing a preventive measure; on the contrary, it was necessary to establish the existence of specific conduct indicating that the individual concerned posed a real and not merely theoretical danger. Preventive measures could therefore not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion, but had to be based on an objective assessment of the “factual evidence” revealing the individual ’ s habitual behaviour and standard of living, or specific outward signs of his or her criminal tendencies (see the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law set out in paragraphs 45-55 above)."

The Court observes that, notwithstanding the fact that the Constitutional Court has intervened on several occasions to clarify the criteria to be used for assessing whether preventive measures are necessary, the imposition of such measures remains linked to a prospective analysis by the domestic courts, seeing that neither the Act nor the Constitutional Court have clearly identified the “factual evidence” or the specific types of behaviour which must be taken into consideration in order to assess the danger to society posed by the individual and which may give rise to preventive measures. The Court therefore considers that the Act in question did not contain sufficiently detailed provisions as to what types of behaviour were to be regarded as posing a danger to society."

            [
                "118. The Court notes that in the present case the court responsible for imposing the preventive measure on the applicant based its decision on the existence of “active” criminal tendencies on his part, albeit without attributing any specific behaviour or criminal activity to him. Furthermore, the court mentioned as grounds for the preventive measure the fact that the applicant had no “ fixed and lawful occupation” and that his life was characterised by regular association with prominent local criminals (“ malavita ”) and the commission of offences (see paragraphs 15-16 above).",
                "In other words, the court based its reasoning on the assumption of “criminal tendencies”, a criterion that the Constitutional Court had already considered insufficient – in its judgment no. 177 of 1980 – to define a category of individuals to whom preventive measures could be applied (see paragraph 55 above).",
                "Thus, the Court considers that the law in force at the relevant time (section 1 of the 1956 Act) did not indicate with sufficient clarity the scope or manner of exercise of the very wide discretion conferred on the domestic courts, and was therefore not formulated with sufficient precision to provide protection against arbitrary interferences and to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct and foresee to a sufficiently certain degree the imposition of preventive measures."

Lastly, the Court is not convinced that the obligations to “lead an honest and law-abiding life” and to “not give cause for suspicion” were sufficiently delimited by the Constitutional Court ’ s interpretation, for the following reasons. Firstly, the “duty for the person concerned to adapt his or her own conduct to a way of life complying with all of the above-mentioned requirements” is just as indeterminate as the “obligation to lead an honest and law-abiding life”, since the Constitutional Court simply refers back to section 5 itself. In the Court ’ s view, this interpretation does not provide sufficient guidance for the persons concerned. Secondly, the “duty of the person concerned to comply with all the prescriptive rules requiring him or her to behave, or not to behave, in a particular way; not only the criminal laws, therefore, but any provision whose non-observance would be a further indication of the danger to society that has already been established” is an open-ended reference to the entire Italian legal system, and does not give any further clarification as to the specific norms whose non-observance would be a further indication of the person ’ s danger to society.",

Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a \"law\" unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, §§ 47-49, Series A no. 30 and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

A law which confers a discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 88, Series A no. 61 )."

On the other hand, the circumstances in which it may be necessary to apply those measures are quite variable, so that it would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality.

                "61. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that during the enforcement proceedings the bailiffs ’ service issued several decisions restricting the applicant ’ s right to leave the Russian Federation. According to the Government, four restrictions were issued in respect of the applicant: on 27 November 2003, 10 June and 24 December 2004 and 26 May 2005, and each of them lasted for a period of six months which started to run on the date when the bailiffs ’ service issued the relevant decisions. In that connection the Court observes that, according to the case materials, the bailiffs ’ service issued six restrictions on the applicant ’ s right to leave the country: the demand of 27 November 2003, the order of 3 June 2004, the demand of 10 June 2004, the order of 24 December 2004, the ruling of 3 March 2005 and the order of 26 May 2005. The Court agrees that all those decisions, apart from the ruling of 3 March 2005, indicated that the travel restrictions were to be applied to the applicant for a period of up to six months. Furthermore, the Court observes that some of those decisions indicated the date on which the six-month period started to run, and that it was not necessarily the date on which the relevant decision was issued. For instance, the order of 3 June 2004 stated that the six-month period would start to run on 22 June 2004. However, contrary to the Government ’ s assertions, the demands of 27 November 2003 and 10 June 2004 and the order of 24 December 2004 did not indicate on what date the six-month period started to run. In view of those factors, the Court is unable to establish the exact dates on which the travel restrictions issued on 27 November 2003 and 10 June and 24 December 2004 were applied to the applicant. Therefore, despite the fact that the order of 3 June 2004 and the demand of 26 May 2005 specified the exact dates on which the six-month period started to run, it cannot be said that each and every restriction applied to the applicant took effect on an identifiable date. In such circumstances the Court considers that the travel restriction was applied to the applicant at the latest on 24 January 2004, when he was not allowed to board a plane to Egypt (see paragraph 20 above) and was lifted on 15 December 2005, when the enforcement proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 14 above)."

However, in the Court ’ s opinion that element is not sufficient to conclude that the events complained of were composed of separate and unrelated occurrences. In particular, the Court observes that all the travel bans were applied within the same enforcement proceedings and with reference to the same legal provisions. They thus formed a continuing act on the part of the domestic authorities by which the applicant was prohibited from leaving the country from at least 24 January 200 4 until 15 December 2005. In such circumstances, the six-month period provided for by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention started to run only after that activity had been brought to an end on 15 December 2005. It suffices to note that the applicant submitted his application during the period when the travel ban was still in force."

The law cited by the Government, namely the 1996 Federal Act on Leaving and Entering the Russian Federation (Procedures), had not been clear enough for anyone to foresee that non ‑ payment of a judgment debt would result in a travel ban. The old 1997 Federal Act on Enforcement Proceedings had not contained any provision authorising the bailiffs ’ service to impose a travel ban on the debtor. It was not until 2007 that a new Federal Act on Enforcement Proceedings had been passed, establishing a framework for restricting a debtor ’ s right to leave his or her own country. The applicant also considered that both the old and the new laws on enforcement proceedings were incompatible with Article 27 of the Russian Constitution."

                "68. The Court reiterates its settled case-law according to which the expression “in accordance with the law” not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question. Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a \"law\" unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, §§ 47-49, Series A no. 30 and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed.

A law which confers a discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 88, Series A no. 61 )."

In the present case the bailiffs ’ service imposed the travel ban with reference to the 1996 Federal Act on Leaving and Entering the Russian Federation (Procedures), section 15(5) of which provided that the right of a Russian citizen to leave the Russian Federation could be temporarily restricted if he or she evaded obligations imposed on him or her by a court.

In particular, they leave them the discretion to decide whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is necessary to resort to travel restrictions or not. On the other hand, the circumstances in which it may be necessary to apply those measures are quite variable, so that it would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality. In any event, the safeguards against arbitrary interference were provided by the fact that the exercise of the discretion by the bailiffs was subject to judicial review (see paragraph 50 above)."

The Court accordingly finds that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to leave his own country pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the rights of others.

The means employed had been proportionate to the aims pursued. The authorities were under a positive obligation to provide an effective mechanism for the enforcement of judgments debts to be paid by private persons and for the protection of creditors ’ property rights. If they failed to do so, their responsibility under Article 6 of the Convention could be engaged. The applicant had not paid the judgment debt voluntarily and enforcement proceedings had therefore been instituted. The bailiffs ’ service had taken various measures to secure payment of the judgment debt. However, all those measures had proved insufficient for the enforcement of the judgment debt, in large part owing to the applicant ’ s behaviour. As established by the decision of 19 October 2004 (see paragraph 11 above), the applicant had attempted to hide his property in order to avoid its forfeiture in the enforcement proceedings. In the absence of any other means of ensuring that the applicant honoured his debt, the bailiffs ’ service had decided to impose a travel ban on him."

Each of those extensions had been limited to six months, unlike in the case of Gochev v. Bulgaria, where the applicant had been prohibited from leaving the country for several years. The bailiffs ’ service ’ s decisions had been duly reasoned and had been regularly reviewed by the domestic courts. On one occasion the domestic court quashed the bailiff ’ s decision ( ruling of 3 March 2005) on the grounds that it had not indicated the period during which the travel ban had to be applied to the applicant. The applicant had been aware of the decisions taken in his respect since he had challenged almost all of them in the courts.

The authorities had the possibility of seizing a debtor ’ s assets located in his or her country of residence or abroad without the debtor ’ s physical presence. Also, preventing persons from leaving the country could be counterproductive if they migrated to another country in search of employment with the intention of using their future salary to honour the debt. Furthermore, the Russian legal system did not provide individuals with bankruptcy protection; therefore, persons who committed a tort and faced a large judgment debt would be barred from leaving the country forever through a series of six ‑ month bans. The travel ban was used widely in Russia irrespective of the nature and amount of the debt. In the applicant ’ s case the travel ban had been imposed for non-payment of a relatively small debt and without any prior notice when he and his family had attempted to board a plane.",

In particular, in the cases of Fedorov and Fedorova ( cited above, § 44 ) and Antonenkov and Others ( cited above, § 64 ), the Court considered that it was relevant in assessing the proportionality of the restriction to ascertain whether the applicants had actually sought to leave their area of residence and had applied to the domestic authorities with requests to that effect, and if so, whether permission to leave the area had been refused."

                "30. Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 guarantees to any person the right to leave any country for any other country of that person’s choice to which he or she may be admitted. The prohibition on the applicant leaving Bulgaria undoubtedly amounted to an interference with that right. The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."
            ],
            [
                "31. The interference was based on section 76(6) of the Identity Papers Act 1998 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), and thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."

                "32. It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."

                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention. Having regard to the established common European and international standard, the Court considers that the Russian Government were under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining the restriction in question."

The applicant would not be a party to such proceedings and would only be informed of the Commission's decision.

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention.

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v.

The Court reiterates that the right of freedom of movement as guaranteed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is intended to secure to any person a right to liberty of movement within a territory and to leave that territory, which implies a right to leave for such country of the person's choice to which he may be admitted (see, mutatis mutandis, Peltonen v.

France, judgment of 22 May 2001, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2001-V, p. 217, § 61).

He received a reply to his address in Karlovac stating that his passport was seized by a customs officer because the applicant refused to pay the fine for a customs offence. It was also stated that the seizure of the applicant's passport was in accordance with the law. Thus, the authorities admitted that the passport was seized.

The Constitutional Court has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations, not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts, but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 27 of 1959 and judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Because of their particular object, preventive measures do not relate to the commission of a specific unlawful act but to a pattern of behaviour defined by law as conduct indicating the existence of danger to society (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Consequently, in the Italian legal system, there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures. The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act.",
                "In other words, a criminal penalty relates to an offence already committed, whereas a preventive measure is intended to reduce the risk of future offences (see, mutatis mutandis, Constitutional Court, judgment no. 53 of 1968, concerning security measures).",
                "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different, not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter. For example, the presumption of innocence enunciated in Article 27 of the Constitution does not concern preventive measures, which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Similarly, such measures do not fall within the scope of Article 25 para. 2 of the Constitution, which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions. The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in the Court of Cassation with regard to confiscation orders under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. The Court of Cassation has ruled, firstly, that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Piraino judgment of 30 January 1985). Secondly, the Court of Cassation has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive, as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered (Court of Cassation, Oliveri judgment of 12 May 1986) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force (Court of Cassation, Pipitone judgment of 4 January 1985).",
                "In spite of these limitations, preventive measures remain open to thorough scrutiny of their compatibility with the Constitution.",
                "As far back as 1956 the Constitutional Court ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law, where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 11 of 1956).",
                "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy. Furthermore, the above two conditions are closely linked. Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 177 of 1980).",
                "The case-law of the Court of Cassation is in this respect entirely consistent with that of the Constitutional Court; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence, any violation of those rights entailing their nullity (see, for example, Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1255 of 29 June 1984 in the Santoro case).",
                "The Court of Cassation has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. In particular, it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the rights of the defence, since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal (Court of Cassation, previously cited Pipitone judgment).",
                "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property (Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution), the Court of Cassation has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest. This applies in connection with possessions of unlawful origin or their use (Court of Cassation, previously cited Oliveri and Pipitone judgments)."

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

                "65. The Court considers that in certain cases restrictions on the ability of convicted offenders to travel abroad may be justified, for instance by the need to prevent them from re ‑ engaging in criminal conduct. It has countenanced much more serious restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals suspected of being members of the Mafia, even in the absence of a criminal conviction ( see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 ‑ A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ). It has allowed such restrictions in respect of an individual who was a danger to society and who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 45 ‑ 50, 20 April 2010 ). In exceptional cases, it has found justified even preventive detention of individuals who have been convicted of criminal offences and have already served their prison sentences (see Eriksen v. Norway, 27 May 1997, §§ 76 ‑ 87, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III ). However, such restrictions can be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual's right to freedom of movement (see, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § 63 in fine, 10 July 2008 ). They must be based on concrete elements which are truly indicative of the continued existence of the risk that such measures seek to forestall (see, mutatis mutandis, Labita, cited above, § 196 )."

The second ban was imposed by the migration authorities on 6 June 2001 pursuant to a request by the prosecuting authorities and was apparently based on a travel ban which the latter had imposed shortly before that under Article 153a § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 10, 20 and 24 above). The possibility of seeking judicial review of the migration authorities'decision cannot be regarded as effective or offering a reasonable chance of success, because the domestic courts were of the view that the prosecuting authorities'decision to impose a travel ban was binding on the migration authorities and that the proper way of challenging a travel ban was by seeking permission to travel under Article 153a § 2 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, under Article 153a §§ 2 ‑ 5, the applicant was not able to challenge the ban as such, but merely seek permission to travel on specific occasions. The possibility to seek the lifting of the ban as a whole came up only with the entry into force of Article 68 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 above), after the criminal proceedings against the applicant had come to an end. However, in so far as the requests for permission to travel on specific occasions – which could be made at any time without restriction – were capable of relieving the effect which the ban had on the applicant, they could be regarded as remedies against it. The salient question is whether they were effective. At the pre-trial phase the applicant could have sought such permission from the prosecuting authorities, and at the trial phase from the courts dealing with his case. There is no indication that he tried to avail himself of that opportunity and was rebuffed (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, §§ 44 ‑ 46, 13 October 2005, and Hristov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 32461/02, 3 April 2006 ). His allegations concerning the procedure's shortcomings thus appear speculative (see, mutatis mutandis, Belchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39270/98, 6 February 2003; Pekov v. Bulgaria, no. 50358/99, § 91, 30 March 2006 l; and Sabeva v. Bulgaria, no. 44290/07, § 65, 10 June 2010 ). There was nothing in the text of Article 153a of the 1974 Code to suggest that the proceedings for judicial review of a refusal by the prosecutor to grant such permission would be tainted by unfairness or otherwise ineffective. The Court is furthermore unable to accept the applicant's argument that the granting of such permission would not have allowed him to travel abroad because it would not have led to the variation of the measure imposed under section 75(3) of the 1998 Act. As evident from the Supreme Administrative Court's case ‑ law, the granting of such permission constituted grounds to vary the measure imposed by the migration authorities under section 75(3) (see paragraph 24 above)."

However, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act, the courts did not have jurisdiction to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting the possibility to travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above).

However, the applicant maintained that after that date, on which Bulgaria joined the European Union, the legal basis for the measure had become problematic, because section 76(2) ran against Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/EC (see paragraph 28 above).

It has countenanced much more serious restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals suspected of being members of the Mafia, even in the absence of a criminal conviction ( see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 ‑ A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ). It has allowed such restrictions in respect of an individual who was a danger to society and who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 45 ‑ 50, 20 April 2010 ). In exceptional cases, it has found justified even preventive detention of individuals who have been convicted of criminal offences and have already served their prison sentences (see Eriksen v. Norway, 27 May 1997, §§ 76 ‑ 87, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III ). However, such restrictions can be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual's right to freedom of movement (see, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § 63 in fine, 10 July 2008 ).

They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicant's right to travel abroad and provide sufficient justification for it. That situation could not have been subsequently corrected in judicial review proceedings (see Gochev, cited above, § 54). As already noted in relation to exhaustion of domestic remedies, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act between 2000 and 2010, the courts were not competent to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above).

It is not the Court ’ s task to determine whether, in a case of this type, the obligation not to leave the place of residence was per se a proper preventive measure. Under the domestic law, a range of preventive measures could be imposed on a person charged with a criminal offence, with the aim, inter alia, of ensuring his or her presence at the place where the investigation was being conducted. It is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty. An obligation not to leave the area of one ’ s residence is a minimal intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v. Hungary ( dec .), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004)."

However, the Court notes that, instead, the applicant attempted to challenge the prolonged application of the preventive measure through the courts. Thus, in July 2004 he complained to the Sabayil District Court that the investigation had been suspended for an unreasonable period and that no procedural steps were being taken. He also briefly but clearly complained that he still remained under the obligation not to leave his place of residence pending the eventual end of the unreasonably lengthy investigation. However, the Sabayil District Court confined itself merely to verifying the lawfulness of the grounds for the suspension of the investigation and failed to examine whether the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement was justified."

In particular, a remedy of this sort shall be “effective” if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays which have already occurred (see Merit v.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that when a Contracting State seeks to shelter behind the duty to exhaust remedies, it is for the State to establish the existence of available remedies that have not been utilised. However, the short passage cited above from the Government ’ s observations contained no more than vague assertions; it did not clearly identify the means of redress to which, according to the Government, the applicant had failed to have recourse. It is not for the Court to ascertain what were the particular remedies alluded to (see, mutatis mutandis, Foti and Others v. Italy, judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 17, § 48 )."

            [
                "43. At the outset, the Court reiterates that an individual is not required to try more than one avenue of redress when there are several available. It is for the applicant to select the legal remedy that is most appropriate in the circumstances of the case (see, among other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 12, § 23, and Boicenco v. Moldova, no. 41088/05, § 80, 11 July 2006 ). The Government have not contested the effectiveness of the avenue of redress which the applicant tried in the present case, namely the judicial review of the prosecuting authorities ’ procedural actions under Articles 442 and 449 of the CCrP. The Court considers that, having exhausted all the possibilities of appeal available to him in the framework of the criminal proceedings in question, the applicant should not be required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for damages ( see, mutatis mutandis, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII, p. 3286, § 86)."

In any event, the Court notes that the Government have not shown whether a separate civil claim for damages was capable of providing the applicant with “direct and speedy redress” in connection with the present complaints (see paragraph 3 9 above). It considers that this remedy was not capable of expediting the proceedings at issue. Moreover, the Government have not shown that such a claim offered any reasonable prospects of obtaining redress for the delay which had already occurred. Even assuming that the applicant could have obtained compensation for past delay, the Government have failed to show that such proceedings would have been speedier than any other “ordinary” civil suit which could have lasted for years and gone through several levels of jurisdiction ( compare with V.A.M. v. Serbia, no. 39177/05, § 86, 13 March 2007, and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 195, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... )."

For the above reasons, the Court concludes that the Government have failed to substantiate that the remedy to which they alluded was an effective one which the applicant was required to exhaust. They have also failed to show whether any separate effective remedy existed in respect of the continued restriction of the applicant ’ s freedom of movement in the context of lengthy criminal proceedings. Therefore, the complaints cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies."

The Court reiterates, in this respect, that an accused in criminal proceedings should be entitled to have his case conducted with special diligence and that, in criminal matters, Article 6 is designed to avoid a person charged remaining too long in a state of uncertainty about the outcome of the proceedings (see Nakhmanovich v.

In any event, the Court takes the view that an overall period of three years and five months, during which the case remained at the investigation stage after the Convention ’ s entry into force, could not be explained solely by the complexity of the case."

As to the conduct of the authorities, it observes that the proceedings were suspended on 25 January 2001, on the ground that the investigation could not be continued in the absence of one of the co-accused, S.H., who had absconded, and of other unidentified “accomplices”. The investigation was resumed on 24 August 2005, more than four years later. Of this period more than three years and four months fell within the period after the Convention ’ s entry into force in respect of Azerbaijan. Nothing in the case file indicates that any procedural activities were carried out during this time. No information has been provided by the Government as to whether the prosecution had complied with their duties under Articles 53.5 and 277.5 of the CCrP and taken the necessary measures in order to find S.H. and the other missing persons and thus to eliminate the ground for the continued suspension of the proceedings."

In such circumstances, the mere fact that it was not possible to bring S.H. and other unidentified “accomplices” before the domestic courts could not serve as a plausible explanation for the considerable period of inactivity in the investigation of the case. In this connection, the Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 53.4 of the CCrP, the proceedings against S.H. could have been severed and suspended, while the proceedings against the applicant continued. Neither the domestic authorities ( in their respective decisions) nor the Government have advanced any plausible explanation as to the reasons for not choosing this procedural alternative."

In order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, such a restriction should be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article, and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v.

Under the domestic law, a range of preventive measures could be imposed on a person charged with a criminal offence, with the aim, inter alia, of ensuring his or her presence at the place where the investigation was being conducted. It is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty. An obligation not to leave the area of one ’ s residence is a minimal intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v.

He also briefly but clearly complained that he still remained under the obligation not to leave his place of residence pending the eventual end of the unreasonably lengthy investigation.

None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant ’ s requests and appeals. On the contrary, the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on the risk that the applicant would abscond, a risk which must have receded in view of the amount of time which passed and the apparent inaction of the authorities conducting the proceedings.

It is true that in August 2006 the applicant received permission to travel abroad on particular dates (see paragraph 23 above).

None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant ’ s requests and appeals. On the contrary, the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on the risk that the applicant would abscond, a risk which must have receded in view of the amount of time which passed and the apparent inaction of the authorities conducting the proceedings.

Although she did not provide information on the reasons which motivated the grant of permission, the Court cannot but note that it was given after the ban had been applied for four years and shortly before the expiration of the statutory prescription, when it must have become clear that the proceedings stood little chance of ending with a final judgment."

                "61. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that during the enforcement proceedings the bailiffs ’ service issued several decisions restricting the applicant ’ s right to leave the Russian Federation. According to the Government, four restrictions were issued in respect of the applicant: on 27 November 2003, 10 June and 24 December 2004 and 26 May 2005, and each of them lasted for a period of six months which started to run on the date when the bailiffs ’ service issued the relevant decisions. In that connection the Court observes that, according to the case materials, the bailiffs ’ service issued six restrictions on the applicant ’ s right to leave the country: the demand of 27 November 2003, the order of 3 June 2004, the demand of 10 June 2004, the order of 24 December 2004, the ruling of 3 March 2005 and the order of 26 May 2005. The Court agrees that all those decisions, apart from the ruling of 3 March 2005, indicated that the travel restrictions were to be applied to the applicant for a period of up to six months. Furthermore, the Court observes that some of those decisions indicated the date on which the six-month period started to run, and that it was not necessarily the date on which the relevant decision was issued. For instance, the order of 3 June 2004 stated that the six-month period would start to run on 22 June 2004. However, contrary to the Government ’ s assertions, the demands of 27 November 2003 and 10 June 2004 and the order of 24 December 2004 did not indicate on what date the six-month period started to run. In view of those factors, the Court is unable to establish the exact dates on which the travel restrictions issued on 27 November 2003 and 10 June and 24 December 2004 were applied to the applicant. Therefore, despite the fact that the order of 3 June 2004 and the demand of 26 May 2005 specified the exact dates on which the six-month period started to run, it cannot be said that each and every restriction applied to the applicant took effect on an identifiable date. In such circumstances the Court considers that the travel restriction was applied to the applicant at the latest on 24 January 2004, when he was not allowed to board a plane to Egypt (see paragraph 20 above) and was lifted on 15 December 2005, when the enforcement proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 14 above)."

However, in the Court ’ s opinion that element is not sufficient to conclude that the events complained of were composed of separate and unrelated occurrences. In particular, the Court observes that all the travel bans were applied within the same enforcement proceedings and with reference to the same legal provisions. They thus formed a continuing act on the part of the domestic authorities by which the applicant was prohibited from leaving the country from at least 24 January 200 4 until 15 December 2005. In such circumstances, the six-month period provided for by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention started to run only after that activity had been brought to an end on 15 December 2005. It suffices to note that the applicant submitted his application during the period when the travel ban was still in force."

It was not until 2007 that a new Federal Act on Enforcement Proceedings had been passed, establishing a framework for restricting a debtor ’ s right to leave his or her own country.

The Court reiterates its settled case-law according to which the expression “in accordance with the law” not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question. Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a \"law\" unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, §§ 47-49, Series A no. 30 and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

A law which confers a discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 88, Series A no. 61 )."

In the present case the bailiffs ’ service imposed the travel ban with reference to the 1996 Federal Act on Leaving and Entering the Russian Federation (Procedures), section 15(5) of which provided that the right of a Russian citizen to leave the Russian Federation could be temporarily restricted if he or she evaded obligations imposed on him or her by a court.

On the other hand, the circumstances in which it may be necessary to apply those measures are quite variable, so that it would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality. In any event, the safeguards against arbitrary interference were provided by the fact that the exercise of the discretion by the bailiffs was subject to judicial review (see paragraph 50 above)."

The authorities were under a positive obligation to provide an effective mechanism for the enforcement of judgments debts to be paid by private persons and for the protection of creditors ’ property rights. If they failed to do so, their responsibility under Article 6 of the Convention could be engaged. The applicant had not paid the judgment debt voluntarily and enforcement proceedings had therefore been instituted. The bailiffs ’ service had taken various measures to secure payment of the judgment debt. However, all those measures had proved insufficient for the enforcement of the judgment debt, in large part owing to the applicant ’ s behaviour. As established by the decision of 19 October 2004 (see paragraph 11 above), the applicant had attempted to hide his property in order to avoid its forfeiture in the enforcement proceedings. In the absence of any other means of ensuring that the applicant honoured his debt, the bailiffs ’ service had decided to impose a travel ban on him."

Each of those extensions had been limited to six months, unlike in the case of Gochev v. Bulgaria, where the applicant had been prohibited from leaving the country for several years. The bailiffs ’ service ’ s decisions had been duly reasoned and had been regularly reviewed by the domestic courts. On one occasion the domestic court quashed the bailiff ’ s decision ( ruling of 3 March 2005) on the grounds that it had not indicated the period during which the travel ban had to be applied to the applicant. The applicant had been aware of the decisions taken in his respect since he had challenged almost all of them in the courts.

Also, preventing persons from leaving the country could be counterproductive if they migrated to another country in search of employment with the intention of using their future salary to honour the debt. Furthermore, the Russian legal system did not provide individuals with bankruptcy protection; therefore, persons who committed a tort and faced a large judgment debt would be barred from leaving the country forever through a series of six ‑ month bans. The travel ban was used widely in Russia irrespective of the nature and amount of the debt.

In a series of cases against Italy the Court found that the travel restrictions, which were automatically imposed for the whole duration of the bankrupcy proceedings and remained in force for very significant periods ranging from thirteen years to more than twenty-four years, were disproportionate even though there had been no indication that the applicant had wished to leave his place of residence or that such permission had ever been refused (see Luordo, cited above, § 96; Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99, §§ 23-25, 11 December 2003; Neroni v. Italy, no. 7503/02, §§ 26-28, 22 April 2004; and Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00, §§ 19-21, 24 March 2005 ).

In another group of cases, where an obligation not to leave their place of residence was imposed in the context of criminal proceedings against the applicants but was not applied automatically for the whole duration of those proceedings and was significantly shorter than the one in the Luordo case, the Court held that in the circumstances of those cases the mere duration of the proceedings was insufficient to conclude that the restriction was disproportionate and that it was therefore necessary to have regard to other relevant factors. In particular, in the cases of Fedorov and Fedorova ( cited above, § 44 ) and Antonenkov and Others ( cited above, § 64 ), the Court considered that it was relevant in assessing the proportionality of the restriction to ascertain whether the applicants had actually sought to leave their area of residence and had applied to the domestic authorities with requests to that effect, and if so, whether permission to leave the area had been refused."

With regard to the proportionality of a restriction imposed on account of unpaid debts, the Court reiterates that it is justified only so long as it furthered the pursued aim of guaranteeing recovery of the debts in question (see Napijalo v. Croatia, no. 66485/01, §§ 78 to 82, 13 November 2003 ). Furthermore, even were it justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual ’ s rights if it is automatically extended over a long period (see Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX; Földes and Földesné Hajlik v. Hungary, no. 41463/02, § 35, ECHR 2006 ‑ ...; and Riener, cited above, § 121).",

In any event, the domestic authorities are under an obligation to ensure that a breach of an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in view of the circumstances. They may not extend for long periods measures restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement without regular re ‑ examination of their justification (see Riener, cited above, § 124, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35 ). Such review should normally be carried out, at least in the final instance, by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of the independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures (see Sissanis v. Romania, no. 23468/02, § 70, 25 January 2007). The scope of the judicial review should enable the court to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see, mutatis mutandis, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, § 60, Series A no. 43 ) ... ”",

Such assistance may be provided, for example, through a bailiffs ’ service or bankruptcy proceedings (see Anokhin v. Russia (dec. ), no. 25867/02, 31 May 2007).

Furthermore, according to the interpretation of those provisions by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 36 above ), the domestic authorities were under an obligation to justify the necessity of the restrictions imposed on the applicant and not just to apply those restrictions on formal grounds but also to take into account specific factual circumstances, which, where necessary, could be verified by the courts of general jurisdiction.

However, in the present case most of the travel restrictions were imposed on the applicant on the basis of documents in the form of “demands” (“ требования ”) or “orders” (“ поручения ” ) issued by the bailiffs ’ service for the attention of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Border Control, and the domestic courts reviewed the lawfulness of the restrictions as applied on the basis of those documents.

In particular, it did not state that the applicant had evaded payment of the judgment debt by various means, as suggested by the Government.

However, the wording of those decisions did not evolve with the passage of time. The bailiffs ’ service repeatedly stated that the applicant ’ s right to leave the country had to be restricted because he had not paid the judgment debt. It follows that by sending those demands and orders to the authorities responsible for internal affairs and border control the bailiffs ’ service merely confirmed its initial demand to impose travel restriction on the applicant and did not re-examine the justification for the continued restrictions on the applicant ’ s freedom to leave the country. It therefore follows that from the outset and throughout its duration, the restriction on the applicant ’ s freedom to leave the country was based solely on the ground that he had not paid the judgment debt voluntarily, and was extended automatically by the bailiffs ’ service without any reassessment of its justification."

In all further decisions the domestic courts merely stated that the applicant had not complied with the judgment debt and, therefore, the bailiffs had lawful grounds for applying travel restrictions in his regard.

According to legal commentators, the institution of bankruptcy has its origins in the Middle Ages (thirteenth century), an era when merchants (in the broad sense, encompassing traders, entrepreneurs and bankers) formed the nucleus of a new social class. In this context, in which the public interest coincided at times with the interests of the merchant class, bankruptcy was designed to impose stringent measures on insolvent merchants. Hence, bankruptcy was subject to criminal penalties (such as banishment, arrest and, in some cases, torture or death) or civil penalties such as the entry of the bankrupt's name in a register, forcing bankrupts to wear distinguishing marks (such as a green beret), loss of citizenship, and other restrictions ( see A. Jorio, La crisi d'impresa, il fallimento, Guiffré, 2000, p. 364; S. Bonfatti and P.F. Censoni, Manuale di diritto fallimentare, Cedam, 2004, pp. 1-2 and 72-73; and L.

Further restrictions flow from the fact that the bankrupt, since he or she no longer enjoys full civil rights, cannot be registered as a member of certain professions (for instance as a lawyer, notary or business adviser).

In its report, the Commission concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention with regard to the child's right to respect for his private life. It took the view that the fact that the court had rejected his application for rehabilitation on the sole ground that the period of five years following termination of the bankruptcy proceedings had not elapsed amounted to interference which was disproportionate to the aim of protecting creditors. The Commission considered that the court should have taken account of the specific circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the applicant had been a minor at the time and that his father had run the business which was subsequently declared bankrupt."

This Article therefore requires the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the “competent national authority” both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief.

It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

In its ensuing case ‑ law the Supreme Administrative Court held that the repeal did not automatically invalidate travel bans under section 76 imposed before it had come into force (see реш. № 13819 от 17 ноември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 6999/2007 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 15106 от 10 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 7052/2009 г., ВАС, V о.; and реш. № 10449 от 13 август 2010 г. по адм. д. № 1609/2010 г., ВАС, VІІ о. ). The matter was settled with the enactment of paragraph 5 of the transitional and concluding provisions of a further Act for the amendment of the 1998 Act. It came into force on 10 April 2010 and specified that within three months of its entry into force all measures imposed under section 76(6) would cease to have effect."

In previous cases under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 the Court (or the former European Commission of Human Rights) has been concerned with such bans imposed in connection with pending criminal proceedings (see Schmid v. Austria, no. 10670/83, Commission decision of 9 July 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 44, p. 195; Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; Földes and Földesné Hajlik v.

                "30. Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 guarantees to any person the right to leave any country for any other country of that person’s choice to which he or she may be admitted. The prohibition on the applicant leaving Bulgaria undoubtedly amounted to an interference with that right. The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."
            ],
            [
                "31. The interference was based on section 76(6) of the Identity Papers Act 1998 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), and thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."
            ],
            [
                "32. It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."
            ],
            [
                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

            [
                "35. Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

            [
                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

The court found that, owing to his diminished mental faculties, the applicant was incapable of looking after his own interests and taking care of his personal affairs. The decision was based on medical records concerning the applicant ’ s level of development and on submissions according to which the applicant was gullible and keen on small children ’ s play.

The court further noted that, according to an expert evaluation dated 26 November 2010 and established by a psychologist, the applicant ’ s decision-making skills were equal to those of a child aged between six and nine years. Consequently, the evaluation concluded that the applicant was not able to consider whether his plans about future were realistic and what consequences or implications they would have. The court noted that the applicant had told the court that he had no particular complaints about his current situation and that according to the witness statements he enjoyed his apartment and work in his home town. There was no evidence that the applicant ’ s situation in his home town was not good. The court found that the applicant clearly did not understand what it would be like to live in a remote part of the country, especially as he had previously lived there for only one year, and what the implications of the move would be for his situation. Moreover, the court found it uncertain how clear or strong the applicant ’ s will actually was, taking into account the evidence regarding his gullibility. It was likely that his opinion was influenced by that of the former foster parents. The applicant ’ s development had improved in his home town and he had been able to live in a special unit for intellectually disabled adults, to go to work and to cycle independently around town. The applicant had in his home town a support network consisting of relatives, friends and staff of the social welfare authorities, a job, hobbies and educational possibilities. Due to the remote and isolated location of the former foster parents ’ home, the applicant would miss out on all these possibilities if he were to move there. The court further noted that according to the plan, the applicant would attend a vocational school far away from his new home, requiring daily long-distance trips each school day, more specifically a 15 km taxi ride to a bus station followed by a 70 km bus transport, and the reverse after school. The court was in doubt as to whether it was reasonable to expect that the applicant could cope with such demands on a daily basis."

The Court of Appeal found no reason to deviate from the assessment of the evidence as conducted by the District Court and affirmed the conclusions reached by the latter. The dissenting judge found that the former foster mother had been the only adult with whom the applicant had had a long-standing and safe relationship in his life. The applicant had clearly understood the importance of this relationship in his life, he knew the former foster family and what life with them entailed, although he might not be able to understand all the implications of the envisaged move. When the applicant had been removed from the former foster family in 2007 and placed in a children ’ s home in Southern Finland, no specific reasons had been given as to why this measure had been in the applicant ’ s best interests. The decision taken subsequently by the mentor in February 2011 had merely confirmed the earlier decision. These decisions had created distrust between the applicant and his mentor.

Preference is to be given to the ward ’ s interests and to the need to safeguard the ward ’ s opportunities to participate in the decision-making concerning him or her. The principle of respect for human dignity is supplemented by the principles of necessity and proportionality. The principle of necessity means that the ward must be permitted to maintain his or her legal competence as extensively as possible, and that that competence can be restricted only to the extent necessary to protect the ward. The principle of proportionality means that the measures to protect the ward must be determined on a case-by-case basis and according to the need for such protection. On the other hand, it may be necessary to restrict the right of self-determination of the ward in certain situations in order to protect his or her own interests.

In this Resolution abuse is defined as any act, or failure to act, which results in a breach of a vulnerable person ’ s human rights, civil liberties, physical and mental integrity, dignity or general well-being, whether intended or through negligence, including sexual relationships or financial transactions to which the person does not or cannot validly consent, or which are deliberately exploitative.",

These abuses require a proportional response – one which does not cut across legitimate choices made by individuals with disabilities but one which recognises vulnerability and exploitation. The term ‘ abuse ’ therefore refers to matters across a wide spectrum, which includes criminal acts, breaches of professional ethics, practices falling outside agreed guidelines or seriously inadequate care. As a consequence, measures to prevent and respond to abuse involve a broad range of authorities and actors, including the police, the criminal justice system, the government bodies regulating service provision and professions, advocacy organisations, user networks and patient councils, as well as service providers and planners.",

There was no guarantee that a change of mentor would have led to a different outcome as far as the applicant ’ s place of residence was concerned since another mentor would also have been obliged to safeguard his best interests.

The Mental Disability Advocacy Centre noted that States were required to ensure that the will and preferences of persons with disabilities were respected at all times and could not be overridden or ignored by paternalistic “best interests ” decision-making. The will and preferences expressed by persons with disabilities in respect of their family relationships and their right to choose their place of residence had to be respected and protected as these issues were an inherent part of a person ’ s autonomy, independence, dignity and self-development and central to a person ’ s independent living in a wider community. In order to ensure that persons with disabilities were both protected from violations and that they had the ability to obtain effective remedies when violations occurred, States had a positive obligation to apply stringent and effective safeguards in order to ensure that their rights to exercise legal capacity were “practical and effective” rather than “theoretical and illusory”."
            ],

                "67. The starting point, based on the current international standards, was that the will and preferences of a person with disabilities should take precedence over other considerations when it came to decisions affecting that person. This was clear from the text of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Even in jurisdictions with a former reliance on the “ best interests ” approach, there was an emerging trend towards placing more emphasis on the will and preferences of the person. There was a clear move from a “ best-interests ” model to a “ supported decision-making ” approach."

                "68. The Centre noted that the Court had held on a number of occasions that guardianship systems constituted a very serious interference with a person ’ s Article 8 rights. Article 8 § 2 of the Convention needed to be interpreted in a manner consistent with international standards, taking into account the international recognition of the importance of autonomy and supported decision-making for individuals with disabilities. Rights guaranteed in Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention were closely intertwined with those of Article 8. Circumstances in which an interference would be justified were limited and had to be restrictively construed. Persons with disabilities needed to be able to choose where and with whom to live, and had to be given the opportunity to live independently in the community on the basis of their own choice and, on an equal basis with others."

The Court observes that the main issue in the present case concerns the refusal of the domestic authorities to allow a partial change in the applicant ’ s mentor arrangements, requested with a view to permitting the applicant to decide for himself where and with whom to live. The Court must consider this matter in the light of the general principles governing interferences by State authorities in the private and family life of individuals guaranteed under Article 8 of the Convention, taking into account the principles governing the State ’ s positive obligations, especially those relating to the protection of particularly vulnerable persons. The Court notes that the applicant has not lodged a complaint under Article 14 of the Convention. However, due to the nature and scope of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 8, lodged by an intellectually disabled young man, the Court considers that within the particular context of its examination regard must be had to the requirement of non-discrimination, bearing in mind that discriminatory treatment can consist of treating differently persons in relevantly comparable situations without an objective and reasonable justification, or of failing to make, without objective and reasonable justification, differentiations between persons whose situations are not relevantly comparable (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV).",

            [
                "71. However, Article 8 does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see, inter alia, Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 78, ECHR 2013; and Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 32, Series A no. 32 ). The principles applicable to assessing a State ’ s positive and negative obligations under the Convention are similar. Regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests, the aims in the second paragraph of Article 8 being of a certain relevance (see Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 65, ECHR 2014; and Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, § 165, ECHR 2016 ). The positive obligations may also require measures designed to provide special protection to persons who are in a particularly vulnerable position (see, for example, Paposhvili v.

As regards this aspect of the case, the Court recalls that discrimination means treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007-IV; and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008)."

The Court further recalls its findings to the effect that where a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State ’ s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question (see Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 63, ECHR 2011 ). The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs (see Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010 ). In the past, the Court has identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their sex (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 78, Series A no. 94; and Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 27, Series A no. 280 ‑ B ), sexual orientation (see Schalk and Kopf v.

The applicant ’ s complaint, in essence, is directed at the fact that by their decisions in the impugned proceedings, the domestic courts refused to change the mentor arrangements as a result of which the applicant was restrained from deciding for himself where and with whom to live.

In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Connors, cited above, § 83; Buckley, cited above, § 76; and Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, § 92, ECHR 2001 ‑ I )."

                "85. Turning to the present case, the Court notes that under Finnish law, the appointment of a mentor does not entail a deprivation or restriction of the legal capacity of the person for whom the mentor is designated (see paragraph 2 9 above). The powers of the mentor to represent the ward cover the latter ’ s property and financial affairs to the extent set out in the appointing court ’ s order, but these powers do not exclude the ward ’ s capacity to act for him - or herself. If, like in the present case, the court has specifically ordered that the mentor ’ s function shall also cover matters pertaining to the ward ’ s person, the mentor is competent to represent the ward in such a matter only where the latter is unable to understand its significance (see paragraph 30 above). In a context such as the present one, the interference with the applicant ’ s freedom to choose where and with whom to live that resulted from the appointment and retention of a mentor for him was therefore solely contingent on the determination that the applicant was unable to understand the significance of that particular issue. This determination in turn depended on the assessment of the applicant ’ s intellectual capacity in conjunction with and in relation to all the aspects of that specific issue. The Court also notes that Finland, having recently ratified the UNCRPD, has done so while expressly considering that there was no need or cause to amend the current legislation in these respects (see Government Bill HE 284/2014 vp., p. 45)."

The Court further observes that, as regards the impugned proceedings, the domestic courts, having considered expert testimony and having heard the applicant in person as well as several witnesses, concluded that the applicant was clearly unable to understand the significance of the underlying issue of the proceedings, namely the plan move to a remote place in order to live with his former foster parents. In reaching this conclusion, the courts took into account the evidence relating to the applicant ’ s intellectual capacity as well as the evidence relating to the applicant ’ s present and prospective circumstances in the case of a move. In this context, the domestic courts also expressed some doubts as to whether the plan actually represented the applicant ’ s own genuine will."

The Court recalls, as it has held in various contexts, that where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among others, Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, §§ 179-80, 24 March 2011).

In this regard, the Court takes note, in particular, of the fact that according to the expert evidence, the applicant ’ s decision-making skills had been assessed as corresponding to those of a child between six and nine years of age. The Court also observes that it is apparent from the factual circumstances and the findings of the domestic courts that, apart from the fact that the former foster parents were well known and close to the applicant, the plan to move to a remote and isolated place in the North of Finland would have entailed a radical change in the applicant ’ s living conditions (see paragraph 17 above)."

In the light of the above mentioned findings, the Court is satisfied that the impugned decision was taken in the context of a mentor arrangement that had been based on, and tailored to, the specific individual circumstances of the applicant, and that the impugned decision was reached on the basis of a concrete and careful consideration of all the relevant aspects of the particular situation. In essence, the decision was not based on a qualification of the applicant as a person with a disability. Instead, the decision was based on the finding that, in this particular case, the disability was of a kind that, in terms of its effects on the applicant ’ s cognitive skills, rendered the applicant unable to adequately understand the significance and the implications of the specific decision he wished to take, and that therefore, the applicant ’ s well-being and interests required that the mentor arrangement be maintained."

The Court considers that a proper balance was struck in the present case: there were effective safeguards in the domestic proceedings to prevent abuse, as required by the standards of international human rights law, ensuring that the applicant ’ s rights, will and preferences were taken into account. The applicant was involved at all stages of the proceedings: he was heard in person and he could put forward his wishes. The interference was proportional and tailored to the applicant ’ s circumstances, and was subject to review by competent, independent and impartial domestic courts. The measure taken was also consonant with the legitimate aim of protecting the applicant ’ s health, in a broader sense of his well-being."

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria. The refusals which followed his return from Germany in the autumn of 2003 in time for the next trial hearing were particularly hard to explain."

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

In particular, after 1993 no fresh effort was made to seize any asset or movable property of the applicant in Bulgaria. The sum of USD 50,000 owned by her was attached until 3 January 1999 but was never seized and, after that date, was paid back to the applicant. The possibility of inquiring into the applicant ’ s resources in Austria, if any, was never contemplated by the fiscal authorities (see paragraphs 14-47 and 53-56 above). The Court considers that the authorities ’ failure to employ obvious means for the collection of at least a portion of the debt undermines the respondent Government ’ s position that the travel ban remained necessary for its collection or proportionate to the far-reaching restriction imposed on the applicant ’ s freedom of movement."

The fact that the applicant had a family abroad was not taken into consideration. Neither the administrative decisions related to the travel ban, nor the courts ’ judgments upholding them contained any proportionality analysis, either before or after the entry into force of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention in respect of Bulgaria (see paragraphs 17, 19, 23, 28, 34, 36, 37 and 39-44 above)."

That was so because the applicable law treated as irrelevant the question whether or not the fiscal authorities made efforts to secure payment by other means, the debtor ’ s attitude and his or her potential ability to pay. The only grounds on which the travel ban could be lifted were payment, submission of sufficient security (apparently understood as security covering the full amount) or, as it happened in the event, extinction of the debt by prescription (see paragraphs 36, 37, 39 and 57-66 above). In these circumstances the travel ban was in reality an automatic measure of indefinite duration. The yearly “confirmations” were merely information notes certifying that the applicant had not paid, with the automatic consequence of the travel ban remaining in place, without examination of its justification and proportionality (see paragraph 41 above)."

The Court considers that the “automatic” nature of the travel ban ran contrary to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country should be justified and proportionate throughout its duration, in the individual circumstances of the case. It notes in this context that in the domestic law of a number of member states prohibitions against leaving the country for unpaid taxes can only be imposed if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person concerned would evade payment if allowed to travel abroad. Also, in a number of countries there are limitations on the duration of the restrictions (see paragraphs 73, 77-80 above). Regardless of the approach chosen, the principle of the proportionality must apply, in law and in practice. It did not in the present case."

The manner in which the authorities handled the yearly “confirmations” and the prescription question – through internal notes that were not communicated to the applicant – is difficult to reconcile with the legal certainty principle, inherent in the Convention.

Before that, he complained directly to the prosecuting authorities, including the Nasimi District Prosecutor ’ s Office, the Baku City Prosecutor ’ s Office and the Prosecutor General ’ s Office.

Having regard to the above, the Court does not consider that an additional complaint about the lawfulness of suspension of the criminal investigation within the framework of the pending criminal proceedings could have afforded any redress in respect of the present complaint. In the present case, whether the investigation remained suspended or was resumed had no bearing on the fact that the criminal proceedings themselves were still pending and that the applicant was apparently refused a passport on that ground. In sum, the Government failed to explain how the remedy suggested by them would provide redress in the applicant ’ s situation. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant has done what could have been reasonably expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies in the present case and that the Government have been unable to demonstrate existence of a remedy that could afford appropriate redress."

However, contrary to that provision, the PRD did not issue a formal decision in writing, containing an explanation of the reasons for the rejection (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, taking into account the applicant ’ s argument that the criminal proceedings against him should have been discontinued several years earlier owing to the expiry of the criminal limitation period, a question arises whether it was at all lawful to apply Article 9 of the Passports Act in the applicant ’ s case."

In the present case, the issue arises whether the authorities ’ actions were guided by such legitimate aims."

            ],
            [
                "51. As for whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes the following. Firstly, the Court considers that the applicant repeatedly raised a serious argument that the criminal charge against him had become time-barred in 1999. Under the 1960 Criminal Code the limitation period for prosecution in respect of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged was five years from the time of commission of the alleged offence (see paragraphs 27-28 above). Since the applicant had never absconded the investigation, the running of the limitation period was never stopped under the 1960 Criminal Code. Neither the domestic authorities or courts, nor the Government have alleged that there were any other circumstances stopping the running of the limitation period in the applicant ’ s case or precluding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings on that ground. Therefore, it appears that the criminal charge in question became time-barred on 10 September 1999 and it was up to the relevant prosecuting authorities to discontinue the proceedings on that date. As for the 2000 Criminal Code, it came into force after that date and was not applicable at the material time. In any event, since the 2000 Criminal Code provided for a longer limitation period for the same offence (seven years; see paragraphs 30-31 above), it appears that, although the criminal proceedings remained pending after its entry into force, it could not be applied retroactively to the applicant ’ s situation (see paragraph 29 above)."
            ],
            [
                "52. Despite the above argument being raised repeatedly by the applicant, the domestic prosecuting authorities and courts did not address it. Moreover, the Court finds regrettable the Nasimi District Court ’ s decision of 2 6 May 2008, subsequently upheld by the Baku Court of Appeal, finding that the domestic courts had no competence under the CCrP to examine complaints against the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to decide on discontinuation of the proceedings (see paragraphs 23-24 above). In essence, this meant that in situations where the prosecuting authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully refused to discontinue proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence had become time-barred, a person ’ s right to freedom of movement could remain restricted indefinitely, without an adequate remedy available to him to challenge the restriction."
            ],
            [
                "53. In this connection, the Court also points out that, although in the present case the applicant did not raise a complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, the fact that the criminal proceedings have been pending for around twenty years without any procedural activity had a significant impact on the proportionality of the restriction of his right to freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention imposed in connection with those criminal proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § § 64-66, 10 July 2008 )."
            ],
            [
                "54. Secondly, the Court notes that, prior to the refusal to renew the applicant ’ s passport in 2006, the applicant had been issued both regular and diplomatic passports on several occasions after the criminal proceedings had already been instituted and that he had travelled abroad on a number of occasions using those valid passports. Each time he had returned to Azerbaijan, where he had an active professional political career and had served as a member of parliament for more than one term. There were no indications that he had ever had an intention to remain abroad and escape prosecution. In such circumstances, the Court sees no compelling justification for the authorities ’ refusal to renew the passport in 2006."
            ],
            [
                "55. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 9 of the Passports Act, following the initial refusal to issue a passport, a repeat application for a passport could be examined only after the criminal proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 26 above). Accordingly, it appears that no further decision can be taken while the criminal proceedings are still pending, resulting in a situation where the restriction on the applicant ’ s travel abroad has remained unchanged for around nine years since June 2006."
            ],
            [
                "56. The Court reiterates that the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods a restriction on the individual ’ s freedom of movement without a regular re-examination of its justification (see Földes and Földesné Hajlik v. Hungary, no. 41463/02, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII ). Even in cases where the restriction was initially warranted, maintaining it automatically over a lengthy period of time may result in disproportionality of the measure (see Riener, cited above, § 121, with further references ). In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. This runs counter to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration in the individual circumstances of each case."

The applicant would not be a party to such proceedings and would only be informed of the Commission's decision. It follows that an application to the Interagency Commission does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such an appeal does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention (see Belevitskiy v.

In particular, a measure by means of which an individual is denied the use of a document which, had he so wished, would have permitted him to leave the country, amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Bartik v. Russia, no. 55565/00, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; Timishev v. Russia (dec.), nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, 30 March 2004; and Napijalo v. Croatia, no. 66485/01, § 68, 13 November 2003).

The applicable test is similar in all cases: in order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 a restriction must be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Bartik, cited above, § 38).",

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention.

The Government's claim that the applicant would be abducted by foreign intelligence services or terrorist organisations while abroad appears to be mere conjecture not supported by any actual assessment of the security risks in the applicant's individual case because of the blanket nature of the prohibition on private international travel in respect of all those who, like the applicant, had had access to State secrets in the past."

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v.

It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

The Court notes that out of the six years and one month (V .S. ) and the nine years four months (A.D. and A.A.) of the proceedings, only four years ten months and eight years one month, respectively, fall within the Court ’ s jurisdiction ratione temporis. However, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after 11 September 1997, when the Convention came into force in respect of Ukraine, account must also be taken of the state of proceedings at that stage (see, Foti and Others v.

On the latter point, what is at stake for the applicant has also to be taken into consideration (see, among many other authorities, Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, § 125, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI)."

Lithuania, no. 36743/97, § 61, 10 October 2000 ). It notes, in particular, that the authorities had to order a number of expert examinations of the circumstances surrounding the impugned transaction. However, the Court notes that the expert opinions in issue were delivered during the pre-trial stage. Moreover, the court did not even question the expert witnesses, limiting its examination to the experts ’ reports. The Court finds it doubtful that the two-thousand pages case-file could in itself justify the overall length of the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Ruiz-Mateos v.

On both occasions the prosecution opposed these decisions and successfully appealed against them to the Kyiv City Court. The Court recalls the Government ’ s submissions in the case of Salov v. Ukraine that the proceedings at issue concerned a “dispute between a prosecutor and the court and the applicant had not been a party to it” (see no. 65518/01, § 72, 6 September 2005 ). In their observations in the present case the Government stated that the applicants “supported” the decision of 22 June 1998 and “did not oppose” that of 20 April 2000. The secondary role of the applicants in these proceedings is further demonstrated by the fact that they, unlike the prosecution, had no right of appeal against the court ’ s decisions to remit the case for further investigation (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, on both occasions, once the Kyiv City Court quashed the decisions to reinstitute the investigation in the case, the case-file was remitted to the trial court with considerable delays. The Court, therefore, finds that the State authorities were the masters of the proceedings which caused the unnecessary prolongation of the trial for five months in June-November 1998 and for one year in April 2000 – April 2001."

Germany, no. 49746/99, 29 July 2004, §§ 51 and 60). Furthermore, the Court notes that although the most frequent reason for the adjournment of the hearings throughout the trial was the victim ’ s failure to appear.

It suffices to note that pending the trial the applicants were subject to an obligation (be it part of the bail conditions or a separate measure) to seek permission from the trial court to leave their places of permanent residence every time they wished to go elsewhere. The Court, therefore, agrees with the applicants that the impugned measure restricted their right to liberty of movement in a manner amounting to an interference, within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention (see Hannak v. Austria, no. 17208/90, Commission decision of 13 October 1993; Raimondo v. Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281 ‑ A, p. p. 19, § 39)."

Italy, no. 32190/96, § 96, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). In Luordo the Court found such an obligation, imposed on the applicant for the duration of bankruptcy proceedings, disproportionate because of their length, in that case 14 years and 8 months, even though there had been no indication that the applicant had wished to leave his place of residence or that such permission had ever been refused. This pattern was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave one ’ s place of residence varied from 13 years 6 months (see Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00, § 20, 24 March 2005 ) to 24 years 5 months (see Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99, § 24, 11 December 2003 )."

                "61. First, the Court notes that, in the present case, the applicants were the subject of criminal proceedings. The Convention permits States, in certain circumstances, to apply preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution, including a deprivation of liberty. In the Court ’ s view, an obligation not to leave an area of residence is a proportionate restriction on an accused ’ s liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v. Hungary (dec.), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004 )."

Accordingly, the obligation not to leave their area of residence was imposed on the applicants for a period of approximately five years three months, out of which four years and ten months fall within the Court ’ s competence ratione temporis."

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicants ’ personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, the Court must also ascertain whether the applicants actually sought to leave the area of their residence and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused."

The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."

They referred to the case of Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 48, Series A no. 28), in which the Court acknowledged that democratic societies were threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism and that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

                "87. The Government emphasised that the applicants had gained access to State secrets through their employment and had voluntarily accepted a temporary restriction on their rights, including the right to travel abroad (here they referred, by way of comparison, to Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

The Government acknowledged that the laws of a majority of member States did not explicitly impose a restriction on the right to travel abroad for individuals aware of State secrets. They alleged however that many countries had put in place “a secret system of measures designed to ensure State control over [such] individuals”. In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The scope of the national courts ’ examination had been confined to a formal verification of the fact that the applicants had had access to State secrets during their employment.

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

                "111. The Government submitted that Russia had to implement its accession commitments in the light of the requirements of the Russian Constitution, having regard to the balance existing in the specific historic context between, on the one hand, the need to ensure its own sovereignty and security and, on the other hand, the ongoing integration into the global world. As regards Russia ’ s commitment to cease to restrict international travel of persons aware of State secrets, the Government submitted that “the intention did not imply a full repeal of the restrictions, especially since the ‘ generally accepted ’ restrictions are not set out in any document”. At present, it could only be expected that the measures for the protection of State interests would be proportionate to the aim pursued and that the national law would be further developed with a possibility of gradually repealing such restrictions at some future point in time. Lastly, the Government pointed out that on 22 June 2011 the Interagency Commission had established a working group to explore common approaches to problematic issues relating to travel restrictions on individuals aware of State secrets. Its task was to develop methodology for determining the specific duration of the restriction, taking into account the extent of their awareness of State secrets and the exhaustive list of criteria for restricting the right to travel abroad. The working group had drafted two federal laws, one Presidential decree and two Government resolutions which were in the process of being approved by the executive authorities."

                "112. The applicants submitted that Russia ’ s failure to implement its accession commitment relating to the lifting of the travel ban on individuals aware of State secrets amounted to a structural problem. That problem had been highlighted in the Court ’ s judgments in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, which had not been executed to date as regards general measures. The situation had not changed after the adoption by the Russian Constitutional Court of judgment no. 14-P, dated 7 June 2012, which had upheld the validity of the travel ban. The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia ’ s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments."

                "113. The Court has found in the present case that a ban on the private travel of persons who have had access to State secrets is in violation of the Convention. The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 60 above). The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50). The Russian Federation became a member State of the Council of Europe on 28 February 1996. However, it has not fulfilled that specific accession commitment to date, that is to say for more than twenty - two years."

                "114. On 21 December 2006 the Court gave judgment in the case of Bartik v. Russia (cited above). It found that a restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his own country was not necessary in a democratic society and amounted to a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (§§ 44-52). On 10 February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, §§ 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (§ 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph 28 above)."

                "115. In 2012 the Government reported to the Committee of Ministers that they had sent a copy of the Court ’ s judgment to various executive agencies and regional courts and listed it in legal databases. They also mentioned that they considered adopting other measures which could be understood as a reference to the works of the Interagency Commission (see paragraphs 63 and 111 above). According to them, the Commission had produced a batch of draft documents and regulations. However, it does not appear that there was any follow-up action. As at the date of this judgment, that is to say six years later, the relevant provisions of domestic law – section 15 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act and section 24 of the State Secrets Act – have not been amended or repealed and have retained the same absolute travel restriction on the rights of persons aware of State secrets."

It is the Court ’ s view that the Russian authorities ’ prolonged failure to implement their accession commitment and to execute two of the Court ’ s judgments is at variance with their obligations under Article 46 the Convention. It is incumbent on the Committee of Ministers, acting under Article 46 of the Convention, to address the issue of what may be required of the respondent Government by way of compliance, through both individual and general measures (see Tagayeva and Others v.
