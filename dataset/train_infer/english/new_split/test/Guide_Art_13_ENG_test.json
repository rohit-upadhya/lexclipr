The principle of subsidiarity does not mean renouncing all supervision of the result obtained from using domestic remedies, otherwise the rights guaranteed by Article 6 would be devoid of any substance. In that connection it should be reiterated that the Convention is intended to guarantee not theoretical or illusory rights, but rights that are practical and effective (see Prince Hans- Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, § 45, ECHR 2001- VIII ).

The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...",
                "As stipulated in section 2 ( 1 ) of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the ‘ violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the “ reasonable time ” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ’. In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said Court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.",
                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",
                "7. In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of compensation for non-pecuniary damage payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable - time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (Court HR, 27 March 2003, Scordino v.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his possessions ( see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 38, Series A no. 332; The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § § 89-90, ECHR 2000- XII; and Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 73)."

According to the Court of Cassation, it was up to the State to provide proof that in a particular case an inordinately long wait for a judgment had not occasioned the applicant any anxiety or distress but, on the contrary, had been advantageous or that the applicant had been aware of having instituted or contested proceedings on the basis of erroneous arguments (Court of Cassation, 29 March-11 May 2004, no. 8896), for example, where the applicant had been well aware from the outset that he or she had no chance of success."

It was, rather, commonly accepted that in most cases the facts would have been established by the domestic courts and that the Court ’ s task would be limited to examining whether the Convention had been complied with. The Court ’ s case-law appeared to be confined to assessing whether the domestic courts ’ decisions, given in accordance with domestic procedure previously approved by the Court, had properly applied the general rules to the specific case.

Moreover, although Article 6 of the Convention guaranteed the right to a fair trial, it did not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or its assessment, which was therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law by the domestic courts. Accordingly, when examining decisions of domestic courts on the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage arising from delays in proceedings, the Court should leave enough room for the courts ’ discretion in this respect since the domestic courts decided on delays in the proceedings on the basis of the same criteria as the Court – and were in a better position to analyse the causes and consequences and thus to determine the non-pecuniary damage on an equitable basis."

That approach has made it necessary to establish scales on equitable principles for awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 41, in order to arrive at equivalent results in similar cases.",

Germany, 16 September 1996, § 55, Reports 1996- IV, and Bottazzi, cited above, § 22). Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy of the type provided for under Italian law for example."

Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see, inter alia, Hornsby v.

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes – payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision – the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal.

The Court reiterates that in many cases of lawful expropriation, such as a distinct expropriation of land with a view to building a road or for other purposes “in the public interest”, only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property (see The former King of Greece and Others ( just satisfaction), cited above, § 78 ).

As the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as the lapse of a considerable period of time (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis, cited above, § 82, and, mutatis mutandis, Motais de Narbonne v.

Moreover, interest will have to be paid on this amount so as to offset, at least in part, the long period for which the applicants have been deprived of the land. In the Court ’ s opinion the interest should take the form of simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted. With regard, lastly, to the 20% tax deducted from the expropriation compensation awarded at domestic level, the Grand Chamber, like the Chamber, has not found the application of that tax to be unlawful as such but has taken account of that factor in assessing the facts ( see paragraph 101 above )."

Article 13 (art. 13) has been consistently interpreted by the Court as requiring a remedy in domestic law only in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \"arguable\" in terms of the Convention (see, for example, the Boyle and Rice judgment previously cited, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52). In the present case each one of the claims of violation forming the basis of the applicants ’ complaints under Article 13 (art. 13) (the \"substantive\" claims) was declared inadmissible by the Commission as being \"manifestly ill-founded\" (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention - see paragraph 25 above) (art. 27-2)."

As the Court stated in the Boyle and Rice judgment, \"on the ordinary meaning of the words, it is difficult to conceive how a claim that is ‘ manifestly ill-founded ’ can nevertheless be ‘ arguable ’, and vice versa\" (loc. cit., p. 24, § 54). Furthermore, Article 13 and Article 27 § 2 (art. 13, art. 27-2) are concerned, within their respective spheres, with the availability of remedies for the enforcement of the same Convention rights and freedoms. The coherence of this dual system of enforcement is at risk of being undermined if Article 13 (art. 13) is interpreted as requiring national law to make available an \"effective remedy\" for a grievance classified under Article 27 § 2 (art. 27-2) as being so weak as not to warrant examination on its merits at international level. Whatever threshold the Commission has set in its case-law for declaring claims \"manifestly ill-founded\" under Article 27 § 2 (art. 27-2), in principle it should set the same threshold in regard to the parallel notion of \"arguability\" under Article 13 (art. 13).",

Whilst those decisions as such are unreviewable, the Court is competent to take cognisance of all questions of fact and law arising in the context of the Article 13 (art. 13) complaints duly referred to it, including the \"arguability\" or not of each of the substantive claims (see the Boyle and Rice judgment previously cited, p. 24, § 54). In order to determine the latter question, the particular facts and the nature of the legal issues raised must be examined, notably in the light of the Commission ’ s admissibility decisions and the reasoning contained therein. In that connection, as the case of Boyle and Rice and the case of Plattform\" Ärzte für das Leben\" show, a claim is not necessarily rendered arguable because, before rejecting it as inadmissible, the Commission has devoted careful consideration to it and to its underlying facts (loc. cit., pp. 27-29, §§ 68-76, and pp. 30-31, §§ 79-83; and the Plattform\" Ärzte für das Leben\" judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, pp. 11-13, §§ 28-39).",

Since 1972 it has lain under a flight departure route from Heathrow in operation for about one third of the year, usually during the summer months. Following objections to the level of noise disturbance, the route was divided into two sections in 1975. At least until 1984 Mr Powell ’ s home fell just within the 35 Noise and Number Index (NNI) contour, which is considered to be a low noise-annoyance rating (see paragraph 10 below).

The bungalow is situated about one and a third miles west of, and in a direct line with, Heathrow ’ s northern runway. It is regularly overflown during the day and to a limited extent at night. It falls within a 60 NNI contour, which is regarded as an area of high noise-annoyance for residents. According to the statistics supplied by the Government, the average height of arriving aircraft over Mr Rayner ’ s property is 450 feet and the average height of departing aircraft varies between 1,235 and 2,365 feet according to aircraft type.

It takes account of two features of the noise, namely the average noisiness and the number of aircraft heard during an average summer day. The flights which determine the NNI at any point on the ground are those which take place between 06.00 and 18.00 hours Greenwich Mean Time during the three busy summer months of mid-June to mid-September and which make a peak noise level exceeding 80 perceived noise decibels (PNdB) at that point. The purpose of the NNI is to represent community reaction to the level of aircraft noise so as to guide planning, development and noise control. Thus, the NNI is amongst the criteria applied in planning controls, so that land within the 35 to 39 NNI contours may be used for residential development, planning permission not being refused on noise grounds alone. However, land within the 40 to 50 NNI contours (moderate noise-annoyance zone) will not be given over to development, except for the infilling of existing built-up areas on condition that appropriate sound insulation is used. No development whatsoever is permitted within the 60 NNI and over contours (high noise-annoyance zone). It is to be noted that the NNI calculation reflects a logarithmic element in the PNdB scale, which has the result that every increase of 10 in that scale represents approximately a doubling of the loudness.",

In the first place, the exemption applies only in respect of aircraft flying at a reasonable height above the ground. What is reasonable is a question of fact depending on all relevant circumstances. Secondly, for the exemption to apply there must be compliance with the statutory provisions referred to in section 76(1). In practice this means the Air Navigation Order 1985 as amended, the Air Navigation (General) Regulations 1981 as amended, the Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Control Regulations 1985 as amended and, of especial importance in this connection, the Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order 1987 (and the corresponding provisions of earlier orders and regulations applicable from time to time).

Under this scheme, which cost the British Airports Authority approximately £19 million, over 16,000 house owners or occupiers applied for grants. The scheme concentrated on those localities that would still be experiencing comparatively high noise levels in the mid 1980 ’ s and on localities where there is the greatest degree of disturbance due to aircraft noise at night. Within this area the amount of grant provided was intended to cover 100% of the reasonable costs incurred. The boundary was based on the forecast 50 NNI contour for 1985 and the composite of the 95 PNdB noise footprint for quieter aircraft. 95 PNdB is the exterior noise level below which current evidence suggests that the average person in an uninsulated room is unlikely to be awakened. After consultation and in line with a commitment by the Government to review the boundaries once the actual noise climate was known, an extension scheme to include additional areas was brought into operation in April 1989 at an estimated cost of £11.25 million.",

In the present case each one of the claims of violation forming the basis of the applicants ’ complaints under Article 13 (art. 13) (the \"substantive\" claims) was declared inadmissible by the Commission as being \"manifestly ill-founded\" (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention - see paragraph 25 above) (art. 27-2)."

It was \"implicit in the Commission ’ s established case-law that the term ‘ manifestly ill-founded ’ extends further than the literal meaning of the word ‘ manifest ’ would suggest at first reading\" (see paragraph 59 of the report). Thus, some serious claims might give rise to a prima facie issue but, after \"full examination\" at the admissibility stage, ultimately be rejected as manifestly ill-founded notwithstanding their arguable character. The applicants agreed with this approach.",
                "For the Government and the minority of the Commission, on the other hand, it was inconsistent for the Commission to reach the conclusion that a substantive claim of violation was at one and the same time \"manifestly ill-founded\" for the purposes of Article 27 § 2 (art. 27-2) and \"arguable\" for the purposes of Article 13 (art. 13)."

                "33. As the Court stated in the Boyle and Rice judgment, \"on the ordinary meaning of the words, it is difficult to conceive how a claim that is ‘ manifestly ill-founded ’ can nevertheless be ‘ arguable ’, and vice versa\" (loc. cit., p. 24, § 54). Furthermore, Article 13 and Article 27 § 2 (art. 13, art. 27-2) are concerned, within their respective spheres, with the availability of remedies for the enforcement of the same Convention rights and freedoms. The coherence of this dual system of enforcement is at risk of being undermined if Article 13 (art. 13) is interpreted as requiring national law to make available an \"effective remedy\" for a grievance classified under Article 27 § 2 (art. 27-2) as being so weak as not to warrant examination on its merits at international level. Whatever threshold the Commission has set in its case-law for declaring claims \"manifestly ill-founded\" under Article 27 § 2 (art. 27-2), in principle it should set the same threshold in regard to the parallel notion of \"arguability\" under Article 13 (art. 13).",
                "This does not mean, however, that in the present case the Court is bound to hold Article 13 (art. 13) inapplicable solely as a result of the Commission ’ s decisions of 17 October 1985 and 16 July 1986 declaring the applicants ’ substantive claims under Articles 6 § 1 and 8 (art. 6-1, art. 8) to be manifestly ill-founded. Whilst those decisions as such are unreviewable, the Court is competent to take cognisance of all questions of fact and law arising in the context of the Article 13 (art. 13) complaints duly referred to it, including the \"arguability\" or not of each of the substantive claims (see the Boyle and Rice judgment previously cited, p. 24, § 54). In order to determine the latter question, the particular facts and the nature of the legal issues raised must be examined, notably in the light of the Commission ’ s admissibility decisions and the reasoning contained therein. In that connection, as the case of Boyle and Rice and the case of Plattform\" Ärzte für das Leben\" show, a claim is not necessarily rendered arguable because, before rejecting it as inadmissible, the Commission has devoted careful consideration to it and to its underlying facts (loc. cit., pp. 27-29, §§ 68-76, and pp. 30-31, §§ 79-83; and the Plattform\" Ärzte für das Leben\" judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, pp. 11-13, §§ 28-39).",

Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1), in so far as relevant, provides:",

In its admissibility decisions of 17 October 1985 and 16 July 1986 the Commission rejected the claim under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) as manifestly ill-founded on the ground that the applicants had no \"civil right\" under English law to compensation for unreasonable noise nuisance caused by aircraft, other than that caused by aircraft flying in breach of aviation regulations. In its report the Commission further reasoned that no separate issue of an effective remedy could arise under Article 13 (art. 13) since its requirements were less strict than and absorbed by those of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1); and that, in so far as the applicants were contesting the compatibility of section 76(1) with the Convention, Article 13 (art. 13) did not guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State ’ s legislation to be challenged as such. It therefore concluded that there had been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) under this head.",

They did have, they maintained, a right of action at common law to sue in nuisance on account of unreasonable noise levels, but they were denied a remedy to assert that right by virtue of section 76(1). The entitlement to bring an action against individual airline operators for flying in breach of the regulations or at an unreasonable height, which was left intact by section 76(1), was, in the applicants ’ submission, theoretical and illusory. They contended that the statutory bar created by section 76(1) infringed the principles enunciated by the Court in the Ashingdane case (see the judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, § 57), in that it did not pursue a legitimate aim, it placed a disproportionate burden on the applicants and, as a result, it destroyed the very essence of their above-mentioned common-law right.",

Further and in the alternative they contended that section 76(1) did not impair the very essence of the applicants ’ \"right to a court\" under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) or transgress the principle of proportionality."

Framed in this way their grievance does not bring into play Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 13 (art. 13). As the Commission pointed out in its admissibility decisions, the effect of section 76(1) is to exclude liability in nuisance with regard to the flight of aircraft in certain circumstances, with the result that the applicants cannot claim to have a substantive right under English law to obtain relief for exposure to aircraft noise in those circumstances. To this extent there is no \"civil right\" recognised under domestic law to attract the application of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 70, § 192). In any event Article 13 (art. 13) does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State ’ s laws as such to be challenged before a national authority (ibid., p. 74, § 206).",
                "For the rest no arguable claim of violation of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) can, in the Court ’ s view, be derived from the applicants ’ subsidiary assertion that the limited entitlement to sue permitted by section 76(1) is illusory. Access to the domestic courts is available to any person who considers that he has a cause of action in nuisance under English law. If a question of the application of section 76(1) arises, it will be for the courts to decide.",

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention (see, for example, the Rees judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, p. 15, § 37, as concerns paragraph 1 (art. 8-1), and the Leander judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59, as concerns paragraph 2) (art. 8-2).

Also, people with disabilities are rarely taken into account, they have no political voice and are often a sub group of already marginalized social groups, and therefore, have no power to influence governments. They encounter significant problems in accessing the judicial system to protect their rights or to seek remedies for violations; and their access to organizations that may protect their rights is generally limited.

Regarding Poiana Mare, immediate measures had been taken to improve the living conditions of the patients and these steps would continue until the hospital was completely rehabilitated. On 25 February 2004, the Minister of Health conducted an enquiry into Poiana Mare. There were deficiencies with the heating and water systems, food preparation, waste disposal, living and sanitary conditions, and medical assistance. Most of the problems connected with medical assistance were caused by the insufficiency of resources and bad management. The Government confirmed that the following measures were required: clarification by forensic specialists of the cause of death of those patients whose death was unrelated to pre-existing disease or advanced age; implementing the hospital’s plan of 2004; hiring supplementary specialized health professionals; reorganizing the working schedule of physicians to include night shifts; ensuring specialized medical assistance on a regular basis; and allocating supplementary funding to improve living conditions. The Government also confirmed that the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health, as well as the Secretary of State of the National Authority for Handicapped Persons, had been discharged following the irregularities found at the Poiana Mare Psychiatric Hospital, and that the Director of the Hospital had been replaced by an interim director until a competitive selection for the vacant position was finalized.

The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, whose intervention before the Court was limited to the admissibility of the present application, submitted that access to justice for people with disabilities was highly problematic, especially in view of inadequate legal incapacitation procedures and restrictive rules on legal standing. Consequently, the frequent abuses committed against people with disabilities were often not reported to the authorities and were ignored, and an atmosphere of impunity surrounded these violations. In order to prevent and put an end to such abuses, NGOs played an important role, including by facilitating vulnerable people’s access to justice. Against that backdrop, allowing NGOs to lodge applications with the Court on behalf of people with disabilities would be fully in line with the principle of effectiveness underlying the Convention, and also with the trends existing at domestic level in many European countries and the case-law of other international courts, such as the Inter ‑ American Court of Human Rights, which granted locus standi to NGOs acting on behalf of alleged victims, even when the victims had not appointed these organisations as their representatives (for instance, in the case of Yatama v. Nicaragua (preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 23 June 2005, Series C No. 127).",

Such exceptional circumstances could concern extremely vulnerable victims, for example persons detained in psychiatric and social care institutions, with no family and no alternative means of representation, whose applications, made on their behalf by a person or organisation with which a sufficient connection was established, gave rise to important questions of general interest.",

The above ‑ mentioned courts’ decisions on the issue of the locus standi of NGOs had mainly been based on an assessment of whether the case concerned a serious matter, whether the claimant had a genuine interest in bringing the case, the claimant’s expertise in the area involved in the matter and whether there was any other reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the courts.",

To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at an international level, with the risk that the respondent State might escape accountability under the Convention as a result of its own failure to appoint a legal representative to act on his behalf as it was required to do under national law (see paragraphs 59-60 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above; and The Argeş College of Legal Advisers v.

In this context it may be reiterated that it is essential that the person concerned should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation, failing which he will not have been afforded “the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty” (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.

Ukraine, no. 29971/04, § 104, 18 December 2008; Dodov v. Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, § 81, 17 January 2008; Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 147, 22 December 2008; Khudobin v.

While the original medical record – as presented at various stages in the domestic proceedings – had not referred to any antiretroviral medication being provided to Mr Câmpeanu, the new document, written in different handwriting, included references to antiretroviral medication, thus suggesting that such medication had been given to the patient. As the Government had relied on the new document to dispute before the Court the CLR’s submissions concerning the lack of antiretroviral treatment (see paragraph 122 below), the CLR submitted that the document had in all likelihood been produced after the event, to support the Government’s arguments before the Court."

Such omissions were significant, since it was obvious that the patient’s state of health had deteriorated during the relevant period and thus emergency treatment had been required. Also, as mentioned above, while the patient’s antiretroviral medication had been discontinued during his short stay at the CMSC, it was very plausible that during his stay at the PMH Mr Câmpeanu had not received any antiretroviral medication either. At the same time, although a series of medical tests had been required, they had never been carried out. The official investigation had failed to elucidate such crucial aspects of the case, notwithstanding that there might have been more plausible explanations for the patient’s alleged psychotic behaviour, such as septicaemia or his enforced segregation in a separate room.",

Whilst the Government alleged that this measure had been taken without any intention to discriminate against the patient, they had failed to provide any valid justification for it.

In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.

Consequently, where an individual is taken into custody in good health but later dies, it is incumbent on the State to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of the events leading to his death (see Carabulea v. Romania, no. 45661/99, § 108, 13 July 2010) and to produce evidence casting doubt on the veracity of the victim’s allegations, particularly if those allegations are backed up by medical reports (see Selmouni v.

The appalling conditions at the PMH had been reported by several other international bodies, as described above (see paragraph 78); the domestic authorities were therefore fully aware of the very difficult situation in the hospital.",

In its brief reasoning, the County Court relied mainly on the decision of the Medical Association and the forensic report, which ruled out any medical negligence in the case while concluding that the patient had been provided with appropriate medical treatment.",

Indeed, the Court has previously found the respondent State to be in breach of Articles 3 or 5 of the Convention on account of the lack of adequate remedies concerning people with disabilities, including their limited access to any such potential remedies (see C.B. v.

In this connection they submitted, first, that the guarantees afforded by Article 3 (art. 3) were not absolute in cases where a Contracting State proposed to remove an individual from its territory. Instead, in such cases, which required an uncertain prediction of future events in the receiving State, various factors should be taken into account, including the danger posed by the person in question to the security of the host nation. Thus, there was an implied limitation to Article 3 (art. 3) entitling a Contracting State to expel an individual to a receiving State even where a real risk of ill-treatment existed, if such removal was required on national security grounds. The Government based this submission in the first place on the possibility of implied limitations as recognised in the Court's case-law, particularly paragraphs 88 and 89 of its above-mentioned Soering judgment. In support, they furthermore referred to the principle under international law that the right of an alien to asylum is subject to qualifications, as is provided for, inter alia, by Articles 32 and 33 of the United Nations 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees (see paragraph 61 above).",

The greater the risk of ill-treatment, the less weight should be accorded to the threat to national security. But where there existed a substantial doubt with regard to the risk of ill-treatment, the threat to national security could weigh heavily in the balance to be struck between protecting the rights of the individual and the general interests of the community.

In these circumstances, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration.

Where violations of the rights enshrined in Article 2 are alleged, compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage should in principle be possible as part of the range of redress available (see Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 97; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 109; and T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 107, ECHR 2001-V). On the other hand, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to “private revenge” (see Perez, cited above, § 70). What is important is the impact the State's failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 2 had on the deceased's family's access to other available and effective remedies for establishing liability on the part of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions entailing the breach of their rights under Article 2 and, as appropriate, obtaining compensation ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 148 )."

The heaviest mudslides registered prior to 2000 occurred on 1 August 1960, on 11 August 1977 and on 20 August 1999.

The scheme chosen by the authorities following a comparative feasibility study provided for the construction of a feed-through mud retention collector. Construction work began, but in 1960 this was disrupted by an exceptionally strong mudslide, and the project had to be corrected and extended accordingly. The construction of the collector was finished in 1965 and operated successfully for 35 years, apparently providing sufficient defence against the mudslides. In 1977 a technical review was carried out following a particularly strong mudslide which seriously damaged some sections of the collector, and it was considered necessary to carry out repair work. The collector was fully repaired by 1982."

There remained a great risk that the first mudslide to arrive, even if relatively feeble, would break the complex because its top section was not firmly anchored to solid rock. The funding for the completion of the construction had been allocated, but as to where the funds had disappeared (between Nalchik and Tyrnauz ), nobody could give me a clear answer. Stressing the importance of this issue and the need to complete the construction, I made numerous appeals to the [KBR President], V. Kokov, and to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the Russian Federation, S. Shoigu. Finally more funds were allocated and the construction was ostensibly brought to completion. ... I refused to take part in the [inaugural ceremony] because of concern for my expert and academic reputation. My assistant specialists, in particular my deputy for the construction [Mr R.] and the geologist [Ms N.S.] drew up a report; here are some extracts from it:'... a failure to submit [project documentation] makes it impossible to assess the project's compliance [with the specifications] ... Given the novelty of the [design] ... the high levels of seismic activity in the area, the high fail-safety requirements for the dam structure, any deformation of which may increase the impact of a mudslide on the town of Tyrnauz and thus significantly aggravate the mud hazard, and also taking into account the inordinate time taken to complete the construction work, with intervals as long as four years, it is necessary to subject the facility to a special architectural survey. [A number of serious technical deviations] give grounds for suspecting a degree of tension within the construction, even without mud or seismic impact. All of this considerably reduces the project capacity of the dam. The visual survey of the dam construction showed signs of wear and tear of sections of it even without mud ...'",

On my way out I saw Khalimat's husband [Vladimir] looking for his trousers and Khalimat herself following me with her eldest son Magomed.

We rushed out dressed in whatever we were wearing. It was raining heavily, people were running in fear and panic in all directions. The rest of the night we spent up in the mountains, trembling with cold and fear. In the morning, we saw the awful spectacle of the town partly covered in mud and rocks with some areas, especially Otarova Street, destroyed by the mud, and the centre flooded with water from the Baksan River.",

All the residents of our apartment block and of the two neighbouring nine-storey apartment blocks returned to their flats. We ate and went to sleep. I woke up because the house was shaking and I heard the noise and people screaming. I opened the door and saw that the right side of our house was missing and the staircase had collapsed. I grabbed my grandson and ran out to the balcony where the fire exit was. We could only make it to the fourth floor where the fire staircase ended; there were about 30 of us gathered there, while people from the lower floors were jumping out of their windows and balconies, which I could see. My neighbours, the men, found some ropes and began taking us down, the children first and then the women. It took me a while to come to my senses after the descent. My neighbour, [the first applicant], was crying and asking about her husband and child. But nobody knew what had become of them and the rest of us were also looking for our relatives. After these events we were in a state of shock for a long time, but no one paid any attention to us. The authorities still do not admit that they were not actually in control of the situation and that nothing had been done to save us from the disaster. They had taken no measures before the mudslide, or while it continued from 18 to 25 July, basically leaving us to our own devices. In our apartment block alone four people were killed and many were injured and remained disabled for life; it is a pity, especially about the children. Nobody knows how many people in fact died, in particular on the night of 18 July, as these facts have been vigorously concealed. We did not bring proceedings with a view to punishing those who were really responsible for everything we had had to endure, because we were sure that the court would never give a just ruling as these people occupy very high posts.”"

Moreover, the advantage to be gained by the applicant in instituting criminal proceedings was not obvious, given that the civil court had competence to engage the responsibility of a particular State authority, and such institutional liability could have provided a basis for reparation to the victims. This consideration is essential given that disasters of this kind are more likely to result from a combined failure of a number of officials, whose individual liability does not necessarily attain the gravity required for a criminal conviction.

Moreover, the applicability of Article 2 has not been contested by the Government. Turning to the applicants'specific complaints, the Court observes that they accused the authorities of having allowed three major shortcomings in the functioning of the system for protection against natural hazards in Tyrnauz, which led to casualties and losses in July 2000. Firstly, they alleged a negligent failure to maintain mud-protection engineering facilities, notably to restore the mud-retention dam damaged in 1999 and to clear the mud-retention collector blocked by the leftover debris. Secondly, they complained about the lack of a public warning about the approaching disaster that would help to avoid casualties, injuries and mass panic. Finally, they complained that these events, despite their scale and devastating consequences, did not give rise to an enquiry that would assess the effectiveness of the authorities'conduct before and during the mudslide, in particular whether everything possible had been done to mitigate the damage. The Court will consider each of these aspects in the light of the general principles set out above.",

The regular occurrence of this calamity in the summer season and the prior existence of defence schemes designed to protect the area indicate that the authorities and the population reasonably assumed that a mudslide was likely in the summer of 2000. This is in fact not in dispute between the parties. What they disagree on is the authorities'prior knowledge that the mudslide in 2000 was likely to cause devastation on a larger scale than usual."

The Court notes that in the year immediately preceding the mudslide of August 2000 the authorities of the KBR received a number of warnings that should have made them aware of the increasing risks. The first warning, issued in 30 August 1999 by the competent surveillance agency, the Mountain Institute, informed the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR about the need to repair the mud-protection dam, damaged by a strong mudslide, and calling for the setting -up of an early warning system that would allow the timely evacuation of civilians in the event of a mudslide. The second warning from the same agency was sent on 17 January 2000 to the Prime Minister of the KBR. It stated that even if restoration of the dam was not feasible, it was indispensible to set up observation posts to ensure the functioning of the warning system in the summer of 2000. The next warning was sent by the Head of the Elbrus District Administration to the Prime Minister of the KBR on 7 March 2000. This warning restated the previous ones and, moreover, referred to possible record losses and casualties in the event of a failure to take the indicated measures. Finally, on 7 July 2000 the Mountain Institute sent another warning to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR calling for urgent installation of the observation posts."

It follows that the authorities of the KBR at various levels were aware that any mudslide, regardless of its scale, was capable of causing devastating consequences in Tyrnauz because of the state of disrepair in which the defence infrastructure had been left after the previous mudslide. It is also clear that there was no ambiguity about the scope or the timing of the work that needed to be performed. However, the Government gave no reasons why no such steps were taken. On the basis of the documents submitted by the applicant, it appears that after the 1999 mudslide there was no allocation of funds for these purposes (see paragraph 3 8 above). It follows from the Government's observations that such funds were only made available after the 2000 disaster. In the absence of any explanation on the part of the Government the Court cannot but conclude that the demands for the restoration of the defence infrastructure after the 1999 mudslide were not given proper consideration by the decision-making and budgetary bodies prior to the hazardous season of 2000."

This is contested by the applicants, who claimed that there had been no sign of any evacuation order when they were returning to their flats. They submitted witness statements confirming that people who returned to their homes on 19 July 2000 saw no warning against doing so.

However, the persistent requests of the specialised surveillance agency indicating that such posts were indispensible for ensuring the residents'safety were simply ignored. By the beginning of the mudslide season the authorities thus found themselves short of means to estimate the time, force or probable duration of the mudslide.

The information submitted in response related exclusively to the creation of the mud-retention dam and the mud-retention collector, facilities that, as the Court has established above, were not adequately maintained.

Indeed, the applicants'claims for damages were dismissed precisely for the failure to do so (see paragraphs 49-50, 60, 67, 76 and 85 above). However, this question could only be answered, if at all, by a complex expert investigation involving the assessment of technical and administrative aspects, as well as by obtaining factual information available to the authorities alone.

Considerations of urgency and efficiency may lead the authorities to give priority to other general and individual measures, such as providing emergency assistance and allotting benefits to all victims irrespective of the actual losses."

In so far as the applicants argued that these benefits did not fully cover their pecuniary losses, the Court observes that the terms of compensation have previously been found an essential element in cases concerning the taking of property under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court found that while the absence of compensation would usually be incompatible with this provision, it does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, § 48, ECHR 199 9-II )."

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance, and notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Former King of Greece and Others v.

In the present case, the damage in its entirety could not be unequivocally attributed to State negligence, and the alleged negligence was no more than an aggravating factor contributing to the damage caused by natural forces. In such circumstances the terms of compensation must be assessed in the light of all the other measures implemented by the authorities, account being taken of the complexity of the situation, the number of affected owners, and the economic, social and humanitarian issues inherent in the provision of disaster relief."

The Court observes that the disaster relief payable to the mudslide victims under the directive of 12 August 2000 entitled the applicants to free housing and an allowance of RUB 13,200 (then an equivalent of about 530 euros ). The victims had equal, direct and automatic access to these benefits, which did not involve a contentious procedure or a need to prove the actual losses. As regards the first, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth applicants, the size of the free housing they received was equivalent to their perished flats. As regards the second applicant, she opted to receive free housing vouchers issued on the basis of the number of family members. She applied as a single-person family and received a voucher for 33 sq. m, as opposed to the 54 sq. m that she could have received had she applied as a family of three. She did not elaborate on the reasons for doing so. As regards the third applicant, she initially received monetary compensation that took account of the size of the perished flats. However, she later exchanged this for a housing voucher, with which she bought housing in the Moscow region which she resold shortly afterwards. Since she did not disclose the details of this transaction, the Court cannot assess her resulting losses or benefits."

Given the importance of this asset, the large number of affected persons and the scale of emergency relief to be handled by the authorities in such circumstances, the cap of RUB 13,200 on compensation for household belongings appears justified. In sum, the Court considers that the conditions under which victims were granted compensation for possessions lost in the mudslide did not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicants."

On the other hand, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to “private revenge” (see Perez, cited above, § 70). What is important is the impact the State's failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 2 had on the deceased's family's access to other available and effective remedies for establishing liability on the part of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions entailing the breach of their rights under Article 2 and, as appropriate, obtaining compensation ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 148 )."

Without such an investigation, the individual concerned may not be in a position to use any remedy available to him for obtaining relief, given that the knowledge necessary to elucidate facts such as those in issue in the instant case is often in the sole hands of State officials or authorities. Accordingly, the Court's task under Article 13 is to determine whether the applicant's exercise of an effective remedy was frustrated on account of the manner in which the authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 90, 93-94 and 149 )."

Moreover, the Court has held above that it would not be appropriate to impose an absolute obligation on the State to evaluate material damage and to assume tort liability in the circumstances where it implemented measures through the general scheme of emergency relief (see paragraph 178 above). In view of these factors taken into account by the domestic courts, their refusal to award the applicants damages in the part not covered by the disaster victims'benefits they received cannot be considered unreasonable or arbitrary.

The Court held in that case that \"in the mere existence of the legislation itself there is involved, for all those to whom the legislation could be applied, a menace of surveillance; this menace necessarily strikes at freedom of communication between users of the postal and telecommunication services and thereby constitutes an ‘ interference by a public authority ’ with the exercise of the applicants ’ right to respect for private and family life and for correspondence\" (p. 21, para. 41).",

However, the Court notes that this information might be unreliable since its source has not been named.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2286, § 95; the above-mentioned Aydın judgment, pp. 1895–96, § 103; and the above-mentioned Menteş judgment, pp. 2715–16, § 89)."

In the instant case the applicant is complaining that he and the next-of-kin have been denied an “effective” remedy which would have brought to light the true circumstances surrounding the killing of Abdülmenaf Kaya. In the view of the Court the nature of the right which the authorities are alleged to have violated in the instant case, one of the most fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, must have implications for the nature of the remedies which must be guaranteed for the benefit of the relatives of the victim. In particular, where those relatives have an arguable claim that the victim has been unlawfully killed by agents of the State, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy and Aydın judgments at p. 2287, § 98, and pp. 1895–96, § 103, respectively). Seen in these terms the requirements of Article 13 are broader than a Contracting State’s procedural obligation under Article 2 to conduct an effective investigation (see paragraphs 86 and 87 above).",
                "In the case at issue, the relatives had arguable grounds for claiming that Abdülmenaf Kaya was unlawfully killed by the security forces. The applicant had made two statements to that effect based on the accounts supplied to him by villagers who had allegedly witnessed the killing. Furthermore, the statement provided by Hikmet Aksoy was in general consistent with the applicant’s allegations. There were, moreover, a number of features of the security forces’ version of the events which required independent clarification. It is true that the Court has concluded that it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was indeed unlawfully killed. Nevertheless, the fact that the applicant’s allegations were not ultimately substantiated does not prevent his claim from being an arguable one for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52).

The firing distance between the security forces and their assailants varied between 300 and 500 metres.

The body was dressed in blue and grey trousers with a cummerbund round the waist, a sleeveless black vest and a striped winter shirt, wearing rubber shoes but not socks.

Secondly, no tests for fingerprints or gunpowder traces on the deceased’s clothes or body were made at the scene. While acknowledging that the autopsy and the forensic examination may have been carried out under difficult field conditions in view of the security situation, the Commission found it remarkable that the body was not flown to a place where further analyses could have been made of, for example, the bullets lodged in the body. The handing over of the body to the villagers precluded any further examination. Thirdly, it appeared to the Commission that the authorities took it for granted that the deceased was a PKK terrorist and they did not consider it necessary to examine seriously the possibility that he had been killed in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the security forces. In this respect, the Commission had regard to the mention made in the autopsy report that the deceased was a PKK terrorist, to the wording of the non-jurisdiction decision issued by the public prosecutor, Mr Ekrem Yıldız, (see paragraph 31 above) and to the apparent failure of the public prosecutor attached to the Diyarbakır National Security Court to put any questions to Hikmet Aksoy about the deceased’s possible involvement with the PKK (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",

However, the investigation was seriously deficient as regards the conduct of the autopsy, the forensic examination of the body and of the scene of the killing and the measures taken subsequently by the public prosecutor, Mr Ekrem Yıldız. The latter in fact proceeded throughout on the assumption that the deceased was a terrorist without questioning the truth of the security forces’ account; nor did the public prosecutor attached to the National Security Court consider it worthwhile to check whether there was any foundation to the allegations made by Hikmet Aksoy on 17 June 1994."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, inter alios, agents of the State (see the above-mentioned McCann and Others judgment, p. 48, § 161)."

It cannot accept that submission, having regard to the fact that the official account of the events was impaired through the absence of corroborating evidence.

No statements were taken from any of the soldiers at the scene and no attempt was made to confirm whether there were spent cartridges over the area consistent with an intense gun battle having been waged by both sides as alleged. As an independent investigating official he should have been alert to the need to collect evidence at the scene, to make his own independent reconstruction of the events and to satisfy himself that the deceased, despite being dressed as a typical farmer, was in fact a terrorist as alleged. There are no indications that he was prepared in any way to scrutinise the soldiers’ account of the incident.",

The only exhibits which were taken from the scene for further examination were the weapon and ammunition allegedly used by the deceased. However, whatever the merits of this initiative as an investigative measure at the time, it is to be noted that the public prosecutor issued his decision of non-jurisdiction without awaiting the findings of the ballistics experts (see paragraph 31 above).",

The Court shares the concern of the Commission about the incompleteness of this report in certain crucial respects, in particular the absence of any observations on the actual number of bullets which struck the deceased and of any estimation of the distance from which the bullets were fired. It cannot be maintained that the perfunctory autopsy performed or the findings recorded in the report could lay the basis for any effective follow-up investigation or indeed satisfy even the minimum requirements of an investigation into a clear-cut case of lawful killing since they left too many critical questions unanswered.",

The public prosecutor’s firm conviction that the deceased was a terrorist killed in an armed clash with the security forces was never in fact tested against any other evidence and the terms of his non-jurisdiction decision effectively excluded any possibility that the security forces might somehow have been culpable, including with respect to the proportionality of the force used in the circumstances of the alleged armed attack.

The public prosecutor’s entry in the post-mortem report to that effect coupled with the terms of his non-jurisdiction decision that his brother stood accused of involvement in a terrorist attack on the security forces (see paragraph 31 above) effectively precluded the relatives of the deceased from asserting in compensation proceedings that the latter had been unlawfully killed in circumstances which engaged the liability of the authorities."

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2286, § 95; the above-mentioned Aydın judgment, pp. 1895–96, § 103; and the above-mentioned Menteş judgment, pp. 2715–16, § 89)."

In the instant case the applicant is complaining that he and the next-of-kin have been denied an “effective” remedy which would have brought to light the true circumstances surrounding the killing of Abdülmenaf Kaya. In the view of the Court the nature of the right which the authorities are alleged to have violated in the instant case, one of the most fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, must have implications for the nature of the remedies which must be guaranteed for the benefit of the relatives of the victim. In particular, where those relatives have an arguable claim that the victim has been unlawfully killed by agents of the State, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy and Aydın judgments at p. 2287, § 98, and pp. 1895–96, § 103, respectively).

Furthermore, the statement provided by Hikmet Aksoy was in general consistent with the applicant’s allegations. There were, moreover, a number of features of the security forces’ version of the events which required independent clarification. It is true that the Court has concluded that it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was indeed unlawfully killed. Nevertheless, the fact that the applicant’s allegations were not ultimately substantiated does not prevent his claim from being an arguable one for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52).

He clarified that his confirmation therein, that the Orhans had not been detained by “our command”, included the stations attached to Kulp District Gendarme Command. Most of the investigation for that letter had been completed before he came to Kulp or had been done by subordinate officers while he was there. Accordingly, he had no idea of the concrete steps that had been taken during the investigation to which his letter referred. Indeed the letter he signed on 22 July 1994 would have been written by a subordinate officer and he may not even have looked at the letter of 8 June 1994 to which his own letter referred. He was unable to say who decided on what was “the necessary investigation” or whether some guidance would or could be sought or received from the relevant prosecutor's office.

It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention ( Timurtaş v.

Before the Delegates, the Government initially stated that they did not have the operations' records to hand, that they were confidential and therefore difficult to obtain. On the final day of evidence, the Delegates recalled their request for these records. The Government was then reminded of the outstanding records by letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000. Since the Government's observations of June 2000 made no reference to the outstanding records, the Court sent further written reminders on 14 June and on 4 and 19 July 2000.

Consequently, the additional delay after these specific requests for the records has not been convincingly explained by the Government's brief reference to clerical errors and communication problems. In addition, the document is rather summary, amounting as it does to a table of one page to describe 30 military operations in the Diyarbakır province between 2 and 31 May 1994. Apart from abbreviated references to the units involved, no details are given as to how many troops were involved, where they were billeted or about the purpose or result of the operations. Moreover, given the Court's findings in the above-cited Çiçek v. Turkey case (§ 132) that on 10 May 1994 military units had carried out an operation in Dernek village, Lice District and the fact that the records submitted make no reference to this operation, the Court finds it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the operations records are not complete."

While on the first day of the taking of evidence by the Delegates (October 1999) the Government indicated that it had no information, on the following day they confirmed that “the responsible officer who carried out the operation in the area is General Yavuz Ertürk”. The Government added, during the oral hearing before the Court in May 2001, that General Ertürk was the commander of the Bolu regiment and that he had not been called before the Delegates because he had already given evidence to Delegates in another case ( Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no. 23954/94, judgment of 31 May 2000, unpublished) and had no further information so that there was no point in his repeating before the Delegates, in this case, his previous statements."

However, no explanation has been given as to why this officer could not be identified until October 1999 during the taking of evidence, which delay frustrated any possibility of hearing his evidence. Finally, it was for the Commission, as it is for this Court, to decide whether and to what extent a witness is relevant for its assessment of facts. In this latter respect, the Court notes that the case of Akdeniz concerned a military operation at a time (October 1993) and place (Alaca village) different to the operation at issue in the present case."

The reliability of custody records is further undermined by the fact that those records will not show whether one was initially apprehended by military forces or not (paragraphs 204 and 309 above).

Indeed, Aziz Yıldız initially said, before he changed his evidence, that he would go to the school to pick up detainees and Hasan Çakır agreed that the military could detain persons there without the gendarmes necessarily knowing about it. Consistently, the gendarme witnesses were clear that they exercised no control whatsoever over the activities of the military at the school or elsewhere. The Court's impression from the evidence is that the military was largely unaccountable for what occurred in the school.

Turkey, cited above, § 85 and the Çiçek v. Turkey, cited above, § 146). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions ( Cemil Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 75, ECHR 2000, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 98, ECHR 2000). This lack of accountability is particularly marked in the present context, the evidence being that the gendarmes knew little of the detail of the military's activities on operation and that they exercised no control over the military and their operational activities."

For the above reasons, and taking into account that no information has come to light concerning the whereabouts of the Orhans for almost 8 years, the Court is satisfied that the Orhans must be presumed dead following an unacknowledged detention by the security forces. Consequently, the responsibility of the respondent State for their death is engaged. Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the Orhans' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government ( Timurtas, § 86, and Çiçek, at § 147, both judgments cited above)."

The Court recalls that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment, cited above, § 161, and the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v.

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (for example, the Kaya v. Turkey judgment, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Öğur v. Turkey, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey, cited above, § 109). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard."

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation.

When the Lice Boarding School query was redirected in May 1995 to the Lice District Gendarme Command, the latter simply responded that there was no reference to the Orhans in the gendarme custody records. The gathering of this information, together with the taking of the briefest of statements of the applicant (8 June 1994, 22 August 1994 and 23 September 1994), of the muhtar and of Hasan Sumer, took over one year.

No statements were taken from the many villagers from Deveboyu or Gümüşsuyu hamlets who directly witnessed the events alleged by the applicant.

Ümit Şenocak, the deputy commander in Kulp District Gendarme Command, signed a letter dated 22 July 1994 confirming that the Orhans had not been detained by his command and promising that the search for the Orhans would continue. He confirmed in his oral evidence that he probably did not complete the investigation to which his letter referred but that it was likely his subordinates did so and that they drafted the letter on his behalf. He did not recall having further investigated. It is not surprising therefore that, when Ümit Şenocak moved on from Kulp in November 1994, Kulp District Gendarme station did not continue the investigation as undertaken in his letter of July 1994. Indeed the next involvement of this gendarme station was the appointment, it appears in 1995, of Ali Ergülmez as Adjudicator who was subsequently transferred elsewhere leaving the entire investigation file in abeyance until 1997 when the newly appointed Adjudicator took up the matter."

Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (...). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security in a context which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in a subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection.”"

No other custody records (for example, from military units) have been produced, or indeed are alleged to exist. Indeed there exists no official trace of their subsequent whereabouts or fate. This fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for the act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of the detainee. In the view of the Court, the absence of data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (above-cited judgments of Timurtaş, § 105, Çakıcı, § 105, and Çiçek, § 165)."

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2286, § 95; the Aydın v. Turkey judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, pp. 1895-96, § 103; and the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 329-30, § 106).",
                "Where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment by the State, the notion of “effective remedy” entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see the Tekin judgment cited above, p. 1520, § 66)."

It came under the jurisdiction of the gendarmerie command at Mardin. The nearest gendarmerie station was at Konaklı, several villages away. The central provincial gendarmerie commander, Şeref Çakmak, knew the village. He had been informed that the İlhan family cooperated with the PKK (Workers' Party of Kurdistan) who were very active in the region at this time. He also suspected the villager İbrahim Karahan of involvement with the PKK."

The descriptions of this area given by witnesses before the Commission's delegates varied. It was common ground that there were stone walls in the garden which were in places quite high. There were rivers or streams to the east and west of this area."

The report by Mardin central provincial gendarmerie command stated that a villager, Mehmet Koca, was wanted for harbouring two persons wanted for aiding and abetting the PKK. The weather was very cold, with snow on the ground."

They ran to hide in the gardens south of the village. They did not hear anyone shouting after them to stop. Ahmet Kurt, the Konaklı station commander, saw the two men running away through binoculars. He was ordered by the operation commander, Şeref Çakmak, to apprehend them. He took a team of seventeen men and went to the gardens."

He was beaten and kicked by the gendarmes. They found Abdüllatif İlhan hiding nearby and gathered round him. İbrahim Karahan saw the gendarmes kick him. He also saw them raise and lower their rifles as if striking Abdüllatif İlhan with the butts. He did not, however, see any rifle butt hitting him. Abdüllatif İlhan remembered that he was kicked many times and struck on the hip with the barrel of a G3 rifle which tore his skin all the way down. He was also struck on the right side of the head with a rifle butt. He lost consciousness and remembered little after that for about a week. The gendarmes doused him in the nearby river to revive him."

Neither Ahmet Kurt nor Şeref Çakmak witnessed the apprehension of İbrahim Karahan or Abdüllatif İlhan and their accounts lacked credibility. Selim Uz claimed that he had found Abdüllatif İlhan concealed in the bushes and that the latter had run away, falling twice near the river. The Commission, however, found that his testimony was inconsistent on a number of crucial points and that he gave his evidence in a clearly exculpatory manner. On being questioned in detail, he also admitted that he could not see exactly what had happened. The Commission therefore found that the Government had not produced a witness who could unequivocally state that he had witnessed Abdüllatif İlhan sustain injuries as a result of a fall. It accepted the testimony of Abdüllatif İlhan and İbrahim Karahan, which it found to be credible and convincing."

A third man, Veysi Aksoy, was also apprehended for aiding and abetting the PKK. The Commission did not accept as credible testimony that a fire was lit to warm Abdüllatif İlhan. Nor were any dry clothes brought for him from the village. At this point, Abdüllatif İlhan had a visible injury to his head, with bruising around the left eye and a mark on the right-hand side of his head, which had bled.

The report was signed by Şeref Çakmak, Ahmet Kurt and Selim Uz. It also bore the apparent signatures of İbrahim Karahan and Abdüllatif İlhan. However, Abdüllatif İlhan was illiterate and unable to sign his name. He generally placed his thumbprint on documents. Although the report purported to have been drawn up and signed at the scene by the persons present, the Commission noted that Ahmet Kurt and Selim Uz recollected signing it later.

Abdüllatif İlhan and İbrahim Karahan were put in the cafeteria of the Mardin central provincial gendarmerie station. İbrahim Karahan recalled that two men in civilian clothes had come to the cafeteria. One of them, who was apparently a doctor, had looked at Abdüllatif İlhan without examining him and said that he was faking his condition. Şeref Çakmak told the Commission delegates that he had called a doctor and a paramedic to examine Abdüllatif İlhan and that, after the examination, the doctor had stated that Abdüllatif İlhan was exaggerating his symptoms. The Commission asked for the doctor and the paramedic to be identified. The doctor identified by the Government failed to appear and give evidence. The paramedic appeared, but could not remember ever being called out to examine a detainee in the circumstances described. No infirmary or medical records were produced to substantiate that treatment was given. The Commission did not make any findings as to who had come to look at Abdüllatif İlhan. It did find that at most he had received only cursory first-aid treatment and that the purported doctor had discounted visible signs of distress, without taking any precautionary steps in respect of an evident trauma to the head."

The Commission's delegates who saw Abdüllatif İlhan on 29 September 1997 noted that a loss of function on the left hand side was still visible.

The authorities' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutors' offices. The complaint may be made in writing or orally.

If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties, the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants, which restricts the public prosecutor's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings. In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council (for the district or province, depending on the suspect's status) to conduct the preliminary investigation and, consequently, to decide whether to prosecute.

In the instant case, the public prosecutor took no steps to identify who was present when Abdüllatif İlhan was apprehended or when his injuries were incurred. None of the documents provided by the gendarmes enabled such persons to be identified. The identity of the perpetrators or possible witnesses was therefore unknown to the applicant. Furthermore, the public prosecutor had taken no steps to find any evidence confirming or contradicting the account given by the gendarmes as to the allegedly accidental nature of the injuries.

The Court is satisfied in these circumstances that the matter was sufficiently drawn to the attention of the relevant domestic authority.

As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 66-67, § 167). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (Article 1 of the United Nations Convention)."

This provision does, however, include the requirement that the right to life be “protected by law”.

The Court considers that the requirement under Article 13 of the Convention that a person with an arguable claim of a violation of Article 3 be provided with an effective remedy will generally provide both redress to the applicant and the necessary procedural safeguards against abuses by State officials. The Court's case-law establishes that the notion of effective remedy in this context includes the duty to carry out a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for any ill-treatment and permitting effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2287, § 98).

He did not take any steps to discover the cause or extent of Abdüllatif İlhan's injuries by questioning the doctors who examined him.

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2286, § 95; the Aydın v.

The life-threatening nature of these injuries was also apparent from the medical report issued by Dr Aydoğan. The incident report and the statements which were taken by the gendarmes alleged that Abdüllatif İlhan's injuries were sustained when he fell, trying to run away. There were, however, a number of features about these documents which should have alerted the prosecutor to the need to investigate further, besides the mere fact that such serious injuries were caused on apprehension by the security forces. These included the lapse of time between the moment Abdüllatif İlhan had sustained his injuries and his admission to Mardin State Hospital, and the appearance of Abdüllatif İlhan's signature on the incident report whereas his statement of 27 December 1992 bore a thumbprint and the explanation that he could not sign. It was also apparent that the incident report gave an unreliable account. It stated that İbrahim Karahan had failed to stop at the gendarmes' warning. However, the public prosecutor did not bring this charge against him as well as Abdüllatif İlhan as Şeref Çakmak had orally informed him that in fact İbrahim Karahan had not tried to run away. A further significant inconsistency was disclosed by the incident report's failure to mention that İbrahim Karahan had been injured on apprehension. Şeref Çakmak's written referral to hospital stated that İbrahim Karahan had also fallen and hurt himself when being apprehended, as had his written report to the public prosecutor of 27 December 1992. The latter document had also made the claim, not recorded in the allegedly contemporaneous incident report, that both men had physically resisted the gendarmes and that it was while pushing members of the security forces that they fell from the rocks. Indeed, each version of the incident produced by the gendarmes differed in significant details."

He also did not seek any eyewitness evidence as to how the alleged accident took place, but relied on the oral explanations of Şeref Çakmak and the incident report which had been signed by Şeref Çakmak, Ahmet Kurt and Selim Uz who, before the Commission delegates, were themselves unable to state that they had seen Abdüllatif İlhan fall."

The remaining complaints, under Article 6 of the Convention, concerning the divergent national case-law, were unanimously declared inadmissible.

Under Article 46, however, it decided, by six votes to one, to order that, within six months of the date on which the judgment became final, the Government must take all appropriate measures to secure non-discriminatory payment of the per diems in question to all those entitled.

This payment was to be effected through their respective municipalities, aggregate sums having been specified per municipality. The said municipalities were apparently chosen because of their “underdeveloped” status, implying the reservists ’ indigence. For their part, the reservists in question agreed to renounce all their outstanding claims based on their military service in 1999 which were still pending before the civil courts, as well as any other claim in this connection.

It ordered that its decision be published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, deeming this sufficient redress in a situation where the civil courts had, despite the said inconsistency, applied the relevant substantive law based on a “constitutionally acceptable interpretation” thereof.

The Constitutional Court was of the opinion that the courts of last instance, by ruling differently on the validity of claims based on identical facts and law, had placed appellants whose claims had been rejected in a materially different position from that of claimants whose claims had been allowed. There had accordingly been a violation of Article 36 § 1. However, the Constitutional Court considered that the allegations before it presented no constitutional basis upon which it could establish a violation of the appellants ’ right to a fair trial in so far as they complained about procedural fairness and the civil courts ’ allegedly inadequate characterisation of the legal nature of their claims. The appellants ’ additional complaint, raised under Article 21 of the Constitution, was also rejected. In particular, there was no evidence to corroborate the claim that the first - and second- instance court decisions in the appellants ’ civil case had been rendered on the basis of any “personal qualities”, this being a precondition for determining the existence of a violation of the principle of non-discrimination. The Constitutional Court took note of the Chamber ’ s finding of 28 August 2012 of a violation of the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 7 above; for additional constitutional case-law to this effect, see decision Už. 2886 ⁄ 10 of 4 October 2012, as well as decisions Už. 649 ⁄ 11 and Už. 2021 ⁄ 11, both of 12 December 2012, in their relevant parts), but for reasons that were different from those stated in this particular constitutional appeal.

The Government were also invited to provide the Commissioner with an appropriate “action plan” within a period of thirty days. In its reasoning, the Commissioner ’ s decision noted, inter alia, that the payments in question were per diems, notwithstanding that the Government had chosen to consider them as social benefits awarded to persons in need ( socijalna pomoć ), and that this was best exemplified by the fact that the reservists in question had had to renounce their legal claims concerning the per diems, as well as the fact that the individual reservists resident in the seven municipalities in issue were never under an obligation to prove their indigence ( imovinsko stanje i socijalnu ugroženost ).

Within these limits, the Grand Chamber may also examine, where appropriate, issues relating to the admissibility of the application in the same manner as this is possible in normal Chamber proceedings. It may do so for example by virtue of Article 35 § 4 in fine of the Convention (which empowers the Court to “reject any application which it considers inadmissible ... at any stage of the proceedings”), or where such issues have been joined to the merits or where they are otherwise relevant at the merits stage (see K. and T. v.

While it was true that the applicants had not relied on Article 21 of the Constitution in their appeal, the Constitutional Court could have examined the discrimination issue since there was information relevant to it in the case file (in support of this argument the applicants referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s decision Už. no. 2156 ∕ 11; see paragraph 23 above). In other cases, however, where reservists had specifically raised the issue of discrimination stemming from the Agreement and relied on Article 21 of the Constitution in so doing, the Constitutional Court had done the opposite and felt no obligation to even consider it (see, for example, Už. 43 ∕ 11 described at paragraph 39 above). The reasoning in all decisions concerning cases like the applicants ’ had been practically identical and had consisted of ready-made formulas. In some cases though, the Constitutional Court had found that there had been differential treatment in breach of the Constitution based on the judicial inconsistency aspect of the case, but had merely ordered the publication of its decisions in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia as a form of compensation."

However, the Chamber found that this assertion, even assuming it was relevant to the present applicants, was not borne out by the facts since there had been extensive negotiations between the Government and the reservists in general, albeit to no avail, on extending the principles accepted on 11 January 2008 to everyone else, and the applicants personally had clearly shown their adherence to this position by bringing their own civil case on 26 March 2009."

It should not take on the role of Contracting States, whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level.

Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports 1996 ‑ IV).

The Grand Chamber, unlike the Chamber (see paragraphs 7 1 to 7 5 of the Chamber judgment), is not convinced that the constitutional remedy would not have been effective in the applicants ’ case. In this connection, the Grand Chamber has taken note of three decisions by the Constitutional Court in comparable cases, the first two ( of 17 February 2011 and 8 March 2012) pre-dating and the third ( of 20 February 2013) post-dating its judgment of 5 December 2012 in the applicants ’ case. These decisions may shed some light on the effectiveness of this remedy in such matters. In none of these cases did the Constitutional Court decline jurisdiction to examine the complaints made under Article 21 of the Constitution in relation to the allegedly discriminatory effects of the Agreement. In two of them it omitted to deal with the issue but upheld the constitutional appeals in question on other grounds (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). In the remaining ruling, pre-dating the case now under review, the Constitutional Court did not determine the complaint, referring to the “accessory character” of Article 21 and noting that the appellants had invoked no other constitutional provision to be applied in conjunction with that Article (see paragraph 37 above )."

In the Grand Chamber ’ s view, the above does not show that the constitutional remedy would have offered no reasonable prospect of success in respect of the applicants ’ discrimination complaint had they sought to properly raise it before the Constitutional Court. On a number of previous occasions when examining applications lodged against the same respondent State, the Court has held that “a constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered as an effective domestic remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of all applications introduced [against Serbia ] as of 7 August 2008” (see Vinčić, cited above, § 51; see also Rakić and Others v. Serbia, no. 47460/07 and others, § 39, 5 October 2010, and Hajnal v. Serbia, no. 36937/06, §§ 122 and 123, 19 June 2012). The Grand Chamber sees no reason for holding otherwise in the present instance. Indeed, where legal systems provide constitutional protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms, it is in principle incumbent on the aggrieved individual to test the extent of that protection and allow the domestic courts to develop those rights by way of interpretation (see Vinčić, cited above, § 51; see also, mutatis mutandis and in the common law context, D v. Ireland (dec.), no. 26499/02, § 85, 28 June 2006, and A, B and C v. Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, § 142, ECHR 2010). As already stated above, the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust that avenue of redress (see paragraph 7 4 above)."

In the Court ’ s understanding this finding indicated that, whilst the interpretation of the statutory limitation rules in the instant case had been deemed “acceptable” when considered in isolation, what was incompatible with the constitutional right in question was the national civil courts ’ differing practices in this area. Moreover, it appears that the applicants could have relied on the said ruling as a ground for seeking the reopening of their case before the civil courts (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above)."

In its above-cited judgment of 28 August 2012, the Chamber carried out a detailed review of the relevant circumstances and, considering that the relevant appellate case-law had been harmonised at the material time (see paragraphs 54 to 60 of the judgment), declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded in a decision which delimits the case referred to the Grand Chamber and which is thus final (see paragraph 5 6 above)."

On the contrary, had the applicants complied with this requirement, it would have given the domestic courts that opportunity which the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is designed to afford States, namely to determine the issue of compatibility of the impugned national measures, or omissions to act, with the Convention and, should the applicants nonetheless have pursued their complaint before the European Court, this Court would have had the benefit of the views of the national courts (see, among other authorities, Van Oosterwijck, cited above, § 34, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 42, ECHR 2008).

In judicial review proceedings the court may rule the exercise of executive discretion unlawful on the ground that it is tainted with illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety (see paragraph 35 above). In an extradition case the test of \"irrationality\", on the basis of the so-called \"Wednesbury principles\", would be that no reasonable Secretary of State could have made an order for surrender in the circumstances (ibid.). According to the United Kingdom Government, a court would have jurisdiction to quash a challenged decision to send a fugitive to a country where it was established that there was a serious risk of inhuman or degrading treatment, on the ground that in all the circumstances of the case the decision was one that no reasonable Secretary of State could take. Although the Convention is not considered to be part of United Kingdom law (ibid.), the Court is satisfied that the English courts can review the \"reasonableness\" of an extradition decision in the light of the kind of factors relied on by Mr Soering before the Convention institutions in the context of Article 3 (art. 3)."

However, as Lord Justice Lloyd explained, the claim failed because it was premature, the courts only having jurisdiction once the Minister has actually taken his decision (ibid.). Furthermore, the arguments adduced by Mr Soering were by no means the same as those relied on when justifying his complaint under Article 3 (art. 3) before the Convention institutions. His counsel before the Divisional Court limited himself to submitting that the assurance by the United States authorities was so worthless that no reasonable Secretary of State could regard it as satisfactory under the Treaty. This is an argument going to the likelihood of the death penalty being imposed but says nothing about the quality of the treatment awaiting Mr Soering after sentence to death, this being the substance of his allegation of inhuman and degrading treatment.",

The United Kingdom Government, on the other hand, contended that Article 3 (art. 3) should not be interpreted so as to impose responsibility on a Contracting State for acts which occur outside its jurisdiction. In particular, in their submission, extradition does not involve the responsibility of the extraditing State for inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which the extradited person may suffer outside the State ’ s jurisdiction. To begin with, they maintained, it would be straining the language of Article 3 (art. 3) intolerably to hold that by surrendering a fugitive criminal the extraditing State has \"subjected\" him to any treatment or punishment that he will receive following conviction and sentence in the receiving State. Further arguments advanced against the approach of the Commission were that it interferes with international treaty rights; it leads to a conflict with the norms of international judicial process, in that it in effect involves adjudication on the internal affairs of foreign States not Parties to the Convention or to the proceedings before the Convention institutions; it entails grave difficulties of evaluation and proof in requiring the examination of alien systems of law and of conditions in foreign States; the practice of national courts and the international community cannot reasonably be invoked to support it; it causes a serious risk of harm in the Contracting State which is obliged to harbour the protected person, and leaves criminals untried, at large and unpunished.",

As results from Article 5 § 1 (f) (art. 5-1-f), which permits \"the lawful ... detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to ... extradition\", no right not to be extradited is as such protected by the Convention. Nevertheless, in so far as a measure of extradition has consequences adversely affecting the enjoyment of a Convention right, it may, assuming that the consequences are not too remote, attract the obligations of a Contracting State under the relevant Convention guarantee (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment of 25 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 31-32, §§ 59-60 - in relation to rights in the field of immigration).

Further, the Convention does not govern the actions of States not Parties to it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention standards on other States. Article 1 (art. 1) cannot be read as justifying a general principle to the effect that, notwithstanding its extradition obligations, a Contracting State may not surrender an individual unless satisfied that the conditions awaiting him in the country of destination are in full accord with each of the safeguards of the Convention.

Extradition in such circumstances, while not explicitly referred to in the brief and general wording of Article 3 (art. 3), would plainly be contrary to the spirit and intendment of the Article, and in the Court ’ s view this inherent obligation not to extradite also extends to cases in which the fugitive would be faced in the receiving State by a real risk of exposure to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment proscribed by that Article (art. 3)."

The United Kingdom Government referred to the presence of important mitigating factors, such as the applicant ’ s age and mental condition at the time of commission of the offence and his lack of previous criminal activity, which would have to be taken into account by the jury and then by the judge in the separate sentencing proceedings (see paragraphs 44-47 and 51 above).",

It is not for the European Court to usurp the function of the Virginia courts by ruling that a defence of insanity would or would not be available on the psychiatric evidence as it stands.

However, the offence charged, being a State and not a Federal offence, comes within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Virginia; it appears as a consequence that no direction could or can be given to the Commonwealth ’ s Attorney by any State or Federal authority to promise more; the Virginia courts as judicial bodies cannot bind themselves in advance as to what decisions they may arrive at on the evidence; and the Governor of Virginia does not, as a matter of policy, promise that he will later exercise his executive power to commute a death penalty (see paragraphs 58-60 above).",

However well-intentioned and even potentially beneficial is the provision of the complex of post-sentence procedures in Virginia, the consequence is that the condemned prisoner has to endure for many years the conditions on death row and the anguish and mounting tension of living in the ever-present shadow of death."

In this connection, the United Kingdom Government drew attention to the necessary requirement of extra security for the safe custody of prisoners condemned to death for murder. Whilst it might thus well be justifiable in principle, the severity of a special regime such as that operated on death row in Mecklenburg is compounded by the fact of inmates being subject to it for a protracted period lasting on average six to eight years.",

Whether or not such a prohibition be inherent in the brief and general language of Article 2 (art. 2) of the European Convention, its explicit enunciation in other, later international instruments, the former of which has been ratified by a large number of States Parties to the European Convention, at the very least indicates that as a general principle the youth of the person concerned is a circumstance which is liable, with others, to put in question the compatibility with Article 3 (art. 3) of measures connected with a death sentence.",

Additionally, indigent capital murder defendants are entitled to the appointment of a qualified mental health expert to assist in the preparation of their submissions at the separate sentencing proceedings (see paragraph 51 above). These provisions in the Virginia Code undoubtedly serve, as the American courts have stated, to prevent the arbitrary or capricious imposition of the death penalty and narrowly to channel the sentencer ’ s discretion (see paragraph 48 above).

However, sending Mr Soering to be tried in his own country would remove the danger of a fugitive criminal going unpunished as well as the risk of intense and protracted suffering on death row.

The Court agrees with the Commission that the machinery of justice to which the applicant would be subject in the United States is in itself neither arbitrary nor unreasonable, but, rather, respects the rule of law and affords not inconsiderable procedural safeguards to the defendant in a capital trial.

I drew the government’s attention during this exchange of views at Vaduz Castle to the fact that it was not abiding by the Constitution and read out the relevant Articles thereof. You replied that you did not agree (or words to that effect) with these parts of the Constitution in any case and that you therefore did not consider yourself bound by it. Since the other members of the government did not contradict you, I was forced to assume that the entire government was of the opinion that the two bodies that hold supreme power, the people and the Prince, must observe the Constitution and the ordinary laws but not the members of the government, who have sworn an oath of allegiance to the Constitution.",

Moreover, the decision no longer to appoint him to the office of President of one of the highest courts, on account of his attitude in the past as well as the opinions expressed by him, did not amount to an interference with Mr Wille’s rights to freedom of expression and to freedom of thought. All citizens were free to propose and to plead for amendments to constitutional or other legal provisions.

As head of State, he was obliged to safeguard the constitutional order and the democratic rights of the people.

The Prince further stated that it was the right of Mr Wille, in his position as a judge, to express the opinion that the monarchy was no longer opportune; that Article 7 of the Constitution should be amended; that the Prince should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Liechtenstein judiciary; and that the Liechtenstein Constitutional Court should be given supplementary competences. However, Mr Wille was not entitled to place himself above the existing Constitution or incite the Constitutional Court to lay claim to competences which were not vested in it by virtue of the Constitution.

In 1992 there was a controversy between the Prince and the government over the date of a referendum for accession to the European Economic Area. The applicant was then a member of the Liechtenstein government, deputy head of the government and in charge of the justice portfolio. In the course of that controversy the applicant had expressed the view that, under Article 112 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court had the power to decide on the interpretation of the Constitution in case of a disagreement between the Prince and the Diet. At the same time the Diet was considering a draft amendment to the Constitutional Court Act. In the explanatory report thereon the applicant had expressed the same opinion. In both cases the Prince had directly contradicted the applicant. Nevertheless, in December 1993, he had appointed the applicant President of the Administrative Court. Thus the Prince’s letter essentially expressed the Prince’s disappointment and surprise that the applicant, despite a previous compromise on the controversy regarding the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, had given a public speech on this issue although he must have known that the Prince could not have been in agreement with the opinion expressed."

He was not dismissed from office nor was his professional activity as President of the Administrative Court obstructed in any other way. But even if the Prince’s letter could be construed as an act of State, the Convention would not be applicable to the case. As the sanction was the refusal to appoint the applicant to a specific public office, it did not affect the applicant in any of his rights, as there was no right, either under Liechtenstein law or under the Convention, to be appointed to such office.

This does not mean, however, that a person who has been appointed as a civil servant cannot complain of being dismissed if that dismissal violates one of his or her rights under the Convention. Civil servants do not fall outside the scope of the Convention. In Articles 1 and 14, the Convention stipulates that “everyone within [the] jurisdiction” of the Contracting States must enjoy the rights and freedoms in Section I “without discrimination on any ground”. Moreover, Article 11 § 2 in fine, which allows States to impose special restrictions on the exercise of the freedoms of assembly and association by “members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State”, confirms that as a general rule the guarantees in the Convention extend to civil servants (see the Glasenapp and Kosiek v.

In the Vogt case, the Court found that Mrs Vogt, for her part, had been a permanent civil servant since February 1979. She was suspended in August 1986 and dismissed in 1987. It concluded that there was indeed an interference with the exercise of the right protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see the Vogt judgment cited above, p. 23, § 44). In the instant case, the Court considers likewise that recruitment to the civil service does not lie at the heart of the issue submitted to it.

The Prince’s letter was prompted, and this is not in dispute between the parties, by a report in the Liechtensteiner Volksblatt concerning the lecture given by the applicant on 16 February 1995 on the nature and functions of the Liechtenstein Constitutional Court, including a statement that the competence of that court under the Constitution could, in matters of interpretation of the Constitution, extend to disputes involving the powers of the Prince. According to the latter, the views thus expressed by the applicant infringed the Constitution, and the applicant’s attitude towards the Constitution made him unsuitable for public office. The Prince confirmed his intention not to appoint the applicant in subsequent letters of 4 April and 2 June 1995 and eventually, by letter of 17 April 1997, refused to reappoint the applicant as President of the Administrative Court after he had been proposed for this post by the Diet.

The measure complained of occurred in the middle of the applicant’s term of office as President of the Administrative Court; it was unconnected with any concrete recruitment procedure involving an appraisal of personal qualifications. From the terms of the letter of 27 February 1995 it appears that the Prince had come to a resolution regarding his future conduct towards the applicant, which related to the exercise of one of his sovereign powers, that is his power to appoint State officials. Moreover, the said letter was expressly addressed to the applicant as President of the Administrative Court, though sent to his place of residence. Thus, the measure complained of was taken by an organ which was competent to act in the manner it did and whose acts engaged the responsibility of Liechtenstein as a State under the Convention. The right of the applicant to exercise his freedom of expression was interfered with once the Prince, criticising the contents of the applicant’s speech, announced the intention to sanction the applicant because he had freely expressed his opinion. The announcement by the Prince of his intention not to reappoint the applicant to a public post constituted a reprimand for the previous exercise by the applicant of his right to freedom of expression and, moreover, had a chilling effect on the exercise by the applicant of his freedom of expression, as it was likely to discourage him from making statements of that kind in the future."

                "( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted, and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever civil servants’ right to freedom of expression is in issue the ‘duties and responsibilities’ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim.” (p. 26, § 53, and the Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, p. 2378, § 56)"

In 1991 a psychiatric assessment expressed the tentative diagnosis of schizophrenia. In July 1994 he stopped living at home with the applicants, his parents. At this time he stopped taking his medication."

                "10. On 27 November 1994 Christopher Edwards, then 30 years old, was arrested in Colchester by the police and taken to Colchester police station. He had been approaching young women in the street and making inappropriate suggestions. His behaviour before arrest, and at the police station where he attempted to assault a policewoman, led police officers to suspect that he might be mentally ill. He was assessed at the police station by an approved social worker, who discussed the matter on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist. They agreed that, while there was some evidence of possible developing schizophrenia, he did not need urgent medical attention and that he was fit to be detained at the police station. Any psychiatric assessment could take place as part of a pre-sentencing exercise. Christopher Edwards was held in a cell on his own. The police officer responsible did not fill in a CID2 form identifying Christopher Edwards as an exceptional risk on ground of mental illness due to the opinion expressed by the social worker. The police officer did, however, note in the confidential information form (MG6A) her belief that if Christopher Edwards was not treated or seen by the mental health team he might seriously harm a female. She was not aware that her own suspicion of his mental state was sufficient to warrant categorising Christopher Edwards as an exceptional risk."
            ],
            [
                "11. On 28 November 1994 Christopher Edwards was brought to Colchester Magistrates' Court. Immediately his handcuffs were removed, he pushed through the other prisoners and confronted a female prison officer. He was restrained, but struggled and tried to approach her again. He was placed in a cell on his own. During the morning, he continually banged on the cell door and shouted: “I want a woman.” He shouted obscenities about women. The applicants met the duty solicitor at about 9.45 a.m. and explained that their son was mentally unwell and that they wanted him to receive medical care and not to be remanded in custody. When the duty solicitor attempted to talk to Christopher Edwards in his cell, he received no assistance from his client who continued to make obscene suggestions about women. The duty solicitor discussed the problem with the Clerk to the Justices."

                "12. On his way to court and in the courtroom, Christopher Edwards repeated his earlier comments about women. The prosecutor had in her possession the MG6A form and had been requested by the police to obtain his remand in custody as there was a risk that he would reoffend and there was a real question mark about his mental state. The prosecutor informed the court that he was perceived as a risk to women, although it is unclear how much detail was given. She relied on the fact that an assessment by a psychiatrist had not yet been carried out in support of her application. Consideration was given by the Bench, together with the prosecutor, duty solicitor and Justice's Clerk as to whether he could be remanded to hospital. It was concluded that there was no power to do so under section 30 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. No consideration was given, inter alia, to the application of civil provisions (sections 2, 3 or 4 of the Mental Health Act 1983) or to section 35 of the 1983 Act, which provided for remand to a hospital for assessment."

The magistrates decided to remand Christopher Edwards in custody for three days, which was a shorter period than usual, bringing forward the date to 1 December so that instructions could be taken and legal aid forms completed. Further consideration would then be given, inter alia, to the obtaining of a psychiatric report. After the hearing, the first applicant telephoned the probation service in Colchester and expressed concern about his son's mental health. He was advised to contact Chelmsford Prison. He rang the probation officer at the prison and informed her of his son's medical history. Her telephone note indicated that she had been told that he had been prescribed stelazine, though he had been refusing to take it or accept that he was mentally ill. The probation officer visited the health care centre and spoke to the senior medical officer, Dr F. Although there was later dispute as to how much detail she passed on to the doctor, he recalled being informed that Christopher Edwards was considered to be a risk to women. However, having regard to the psychiatric social worker's comments that Christopher Edwards was fit for detention in a police station and the fact that the court had not ordered any psychiatric reports, he stated that he would not interfere with the usual admissions procedure which meant that Christopher Edwards would be screened on arrival in the usual way and his location in the prison would depend on the result of that process. Neither he nor the probation officer passed on any of this information to the reception staff."

A prison officer returning to Chelmsford Prison from the Magistrates' Court informed the officer in charge of reception staff that a female prison officer had been assaulted by a prisoner who was due to arrive later that day. The police officers at the Magistrates' Court custody area suspected from his behaviour that Christopher Edwards was mentally abnormal and might be a threat to women and decided to warn the prison staff. A police officer rang and spoke to the senior officer at the prison reception and told him, inter alia, that the magistrates had wanted to remand Christopher Edwards to a mental hospital and that he had assaulted a female prison officer. The senior officer was concerned at this information and contacted the Magistrates' Court to verify whether he was being remanded under a normal warrant. He also spoke to the duty governor about the allocation of Christopher Edwards and it was decided, subject to the health care screening, that he should be located on wing D-1 where no female officers worked."

The reception staff were aware of the information passed on from the police at the Magistrates' Court and that he was a potential danger to women. He was placed in a holding area while the other prison arrivals were processed. His behaviour was noted as “strange” and “odd” and when being placed in the holding cell he was aggressive and tried to punch a prison officer. After two hours he was screened by Mr N., a member of the prison health care staff, who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre. Mr N. knew nothing about previous discussions in the court or the concerns passed on to the prison about Christopher Edwards's mental health. He was only aware that Christopher Edwards was alleged to have assaulted a female police constable. Mr N. followed the standard questionnaire. To question 5 (Have you ever been seen by a psychiatrist?), the answer was “three years ago”. Christopher Edwards did not disclose that he had been taking stelazine. There was no evidence of active mental disturbance or bizarre behaviour during the interview, which was unlikely to have lasted more than ten minutes. No medical officer was on duty at the centre at this time, or was present in the prison. Christopher Edwards was admitted to the main prison and placed in cell D1-6."

At Maldon police station, he was seen by a police surgeon as it was suspected that he was mentally ill. The police surgeon certified that Richard Linford was not fit to be detained. Richard Linford was assessed by a psychiatric registrar who consulted on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist, who decided that he did not need to be admitted to hospital and that he was fit to be detained. Richard Linford was transferred to Chelmsford police station, where the police surgeon also found him fit to be detained. While his conduct before and after arrest was bizarre, it was attributed by the doctors to the effects of alcohol abuse, amphetamine withdrawal and to a deliberate attempt to manipulate the criminal justice system. The registrar, who had previously treated Richard Linford, knew that he had been diagnosed at various times as suffering from schizophrenia or as having a personality disorder, but also knew him as someone who became ill when abusing alcohol and drugs. Over the weekend, Richard Linford showed further bizarre behaviour and was violent towards police officers. He was not reassessed by a doctor. No CID2 form was filled in, although police officers remained of the opinion that he was mentally ill. On 28 November 1994 Richard Linford was remanded in custody by Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The magistrates were presented with a “sane but dangerous” description of him. Richard Linford arrived at Chelmsford Prison shortly after Christopher Edwards, where he was screened by the same member of the prison health care service who had seen Christopher Edwards and who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre. Richard Linford did not behave in a bizarre fashion during the screening. Mr N. did not have knowledge of Richard Linford's previous convictions, which would have alerted him to his admittance to hospital in 1988."

Additionally, once the button was pressed, a buzzer sounded on the landing and a red light lit up on a control panel in the office on the landing concerned, indicating the cell. The red light remained on and the buzzer continued to sound even if the prisoner ceased to press the button. At 9 p.m., either Christopher Edwards or Richard Linford pressed the call button. A prison officer saw the green light outside the cell and was told that they wished one of the cell lights, operated from the exterior, to be switched off. He agreed to do so. He saw that the two men appeared to be “getting on all right”. He noticed that while the green light had gone on the buzzer which should have been sounding continuously had not done so.

On going to investigate he saw the green light on outside cell D1-6. Looking through the spy hole, he saw Richard Linford holding a bloodstained plastic fork and noticed blood on the floor and on Linford's feet. There was a delay of five minutes while officers donned protective clothing. They entered the cell to find that Christopher Edwards had been stamped and kicked to death. Richard Linford was making continual reference to being possessed by evil spirits and devils.

The system could be disabled simply by wedging a matchstick behind the re-set button on the control panel and it could not be ruled out that it might have been tampered with by a prison officer or prisoner who wanted a “quiet night”. The fact that it could so easily be disabled rendered the system inadequate and unsafe.

Although the scope of such a positive obligation might vary, it was particularly stringent where an individual died in custody. The test was whether the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to his life from the criminal acts of a third party and whether the authorities failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. It was incorrect therefore to focus on what the authorities knew, as proposed by the Government, – a subjective approach – rather than the objective approach of considering what the authorities ought to have known. It is clear that the prison authorities knew, or least ought to have known, that there was a real and immediate danger to Christopher Edwards's life when they placed Richard Linford in his cell. They were aware or ought to have been aware of Richard Linford's dangerous condition and of Christopher Edwards's vulnerability. That the authorities actually knew is indicated, inter alia, by evidence given at the inquiry which showed that prison officers knew that Christopher Edwards needed to be isolated from other prisoners for his own safety and that they knew Richard Linford, who had been continuously involved in fighting, was not fit to be with other prisoners. The only reason given for placing both men together was to free a cell for other detainees. The Government's assertion that the procedures applied to the reception of prisoners was adequate is at odds with the changes made to the system following this case and others which raised public concern about mental-health screening of prisoners on their arrival at a prison."

In addition, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 rests on all public authorities, not only the prison authorities. The test should not be construed narrowly to focus on the particular agency or officer dealing with the victim at the time of the incident, but should take into account systemic failure involving a number of different authorities."

This case could be distinguished from Osman v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII), which concerned a series of missed opportunities in an investigation which might possibly have led to the detention of the individual who committed the killing, as in this case Christopher Edwards was actively exposed to the risk of harm by another by the very authorities in whose care he had been placed.

In this case, an experienced social worker and a consultant psychiatrist found that Christopher Edwards was fit to be detained in a police station and did not require urgent medical attention. Even if a doctor had been called to the police station, it is unlikely that this would have had any material impact on what happened. The inquiry found that the advice given by the consultant psychiatrist that Christopher Edwards was fit to be detained was reasonable. It is also a matter of speculation to claim that if the police had filled in a CID2 form, this would have led to his placement in the health care centre of Chelmsford Prison. When Christopher Edwards was admitted to prison and examined for admission to the health care centre, there was no evidence of bizarre behaviour. Nor do the Government accept that there was any failure to pass on information to the prison about his illness. A police officer had telephoned from the court to inform the prison reception that the court had wanted to commit him under the Mental Health Act 1983; a probation officer left a message that Christopher Edwards might be a risk to women, while the first applicant informed the prison probation officer of his son's mental illness. They emphasise that it was only necessary for a prisoner to be examined on reception in prison if the health care worker assessed him to be in need of urgent medical attention, the purpose of the screening being principally to identify quickly those prisoners in need of urgent treatment. The current policy is that new prisoners should be seen by a medical officer within twenty-four hours of admission, it being impossible to conduct thorough examinations of all newcomers on arrival in a busy prison."

Further, after his arrest, Richard Linford was found by two doctors to disclose no signs of psychosis and was afterwards noted to be acting rationally and without aggressive behaviour. Even if the doctors who saw him at this stage had seen his medical notes and contacted his consultant psychiatrist, the inquiry noted that the consultant would have been content for Linford to remain in custody. Linford was also found not to be acting in such a way as to justify admission to the prison health care centre. It was his injuries and uncooperative attitude which initially led him to be placed in a cell by himself, not any suspected mental illness. Therefore, even if a CID2 form had been completed, it would be speculative to claim that this would have made any difference, as it would be to draw conclusions from the omissions made in the transmission of information about Linford.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by a law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions.

That Richard Linford was mentally ill was known to the doctors who were treating him – he had been admitted to hospital in 1988 and been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. He also had a history of violent outbursts and assaults. However, some weeks prior to his arrest on 26 November 1994, while fears had arisen that he was capable of serious violence, the consultant psychiatrist considered that one more effort to manage his behaviour through depot medication was required before steps were taken to detain him under the Mental Health Act 1983. At the police station, after his arrest, his bizarre behaviour led the police to suspect that he was mentally ill and the police surgeon considered that his mental state was such that he was not fit to be detained. This view was overruled, somewhat to the surprise of the police, by the psychiatric registrar who examined him and concluded that his behaviour could be a result of substance abuse and a deliberate attempt at manipulation. The registrar did not consult Richard Linford's notes which would have shown him that he was under consideration for compulsory committal. While in the police station, Richard Linford's behaviour continued to fluctuate with violent and bizarre episodes. When he arrived at the prison after being remanded in custody by the court, he bore visible signs of injury and was known to the screening health worker to have been “difficult”. The screening health worker was not, however, made aware of his prison record or his previous committal to hospital and the police, prosecution and court did not pass on any detailed information relating to his conduct and his known history of mental disturbance."

It was not. There was a series of shortcomings in the transmission of information, from the failure of the registrar to consult Richard Linford's notes in order to obtain the full picture, the failure of the police to fill in a CID2 form (exceptional risk) and the failure of the police, prosecution or Magistrates' Court to take steps to inform the prison authorities in any other way of Richard Linford's suspected dangerousness and instability."

They submit that the screening process concentrated on the behaviour of the prisoner on admission and was not expected to be a full medical or psychiatric examination, a doctor generally visiting each prisoner within a day of arrival. However, the inquiry report considered that if the screening health worker had been properly informed of Richard Linford's background, he would have perhaps paid closer attention, noticing that Linford had lied in his answers in the questionnaire and he might in those circumstances have erred on the side of caution and not placed him on ordinary location. It is true that this is speculation to some extent. However, the Court considers that it is self-evident that the screening process of the new arrivals in a prison should serve to identify effectively those prisoners who require for their own welfare or the welfare of other prisoners to be placed under medical supervision. The defects in the information provided to the prison admissions staff were combined in this case with the brief and cursory nature of the examination carried out by a screening health worker who was found by the inquiry to be inadequately trained and acting in the absence of a doctor to whom recourse could be had in case of difficulty or doubt."

However, although it would obviously have been desirable for Christopher Edwards to be detained either in a hospital or the health care centre of the prison, his life was placed at risk by the introduction into his cell of a dangerously unstable prisoner and it is the shortcomings in that regard which are most relevant to the issues in this case.

While there was no particular form of inquiry imposed, they argue that a more rigorous scrutiny was required in this case due to the fact that the circumstances in which Christopher Edwards died were unclear, there was no criminal trial, as Richard Linford pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and there was no coroner's inquest.

They refer to the fact that the inquiry was privately commissioned by the agencies which were themselves the subject of investigation and which themselves fixed the terms of reference and appointed the inquiry chairman, panel and counsel. The proceedings were held in private and the applicants were only able to attend to give evidence. Nor were the applicants legally represented or able to have witnesses cross-examined. Furthermore, the inquiry had no power to compel witnesses. A number of witnesses failed to appear, including a crucial witness, a prison officer who had passed by the cell shortly before Christopher Edwards died. Therefore, the inquiry was deprived of “potentially significant evidence”. It was in addition neither prompt nor reasonably expeditious, commencing only in May 1996 and the final report being published some three and a half years later in June 1998, time being taken to give witnesses an opportunity to comment on draft findings in proceedings which the applicants themselves were not entitled to attend."

As regards the procedural obligation under Article 2, the Government point out that its requirements would inevitably vary with the circumstances and did not invariably require a particular form of investigation or that the family of the victim should enjoy rights to legal representation, for example. The primary obligation under Article 2 was for the State to refrain from the unlawful taking of life. In other cases, where the allegation was negligence, less formal investigations would be required, if at all, and the availability of civil proceedings might suffice. The focus of Article 2 was on the effectiveness of the investigation and not the right to a fair and public hearing for particular individuals. They submit that the non-statutory inquiry in this case was an effective investigation: it was chaired by senior counsel; its members were senior and experienced professionals; its terms of reference were broad and designed to enable the fullest possible investigation; it was the longest and most expensive inquiry of its kind (lasting three years and costing about GBP 1,000,000) and it was serviced by an independent firm of solicitors. The fact that the inquiry was commissioned by agencies that were in part the subject of the investigation and appointed the chairman did not remove its independence. It was precisely such agencies that had the best reason to set up the inquiry so that they might learn lessons for the future."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, p. 49, § 161, and Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 324, § 86). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v.

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy providing a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, for example, Salman, cited above, § 106; Tanrıkulu v.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see the recent Northern Irish judgments concerning the inability of inquests to compel the security-force witnesses directly involved in the use of lethal force, for example, Hugh Jordan, cited above, § 127)."

In this case, it notes the considerable amount of preparation required for an inquiry of this complexity, the number of witnesses involved in the proceedings (about 150 attended the inquiry while others submitted written evidence) and the wide scope of the investigation which covered the involvement of numerous public services. The panel also carried out visits to the places involved in the events and interviewed Richard Linford in hospital. The compilation of the report, whose thoroughness the Court has already remarked upon, was a sensitive and complex endeavour. It was also reasonable to invite the witnesses to comment on the draft findings, given that these involved censure of official practices and individual professional performances.

In Wright (cited above), the High Court held that there was a continuing obligation on the Home Office after 2 October 2000 to investigate a death in custody which had occurred before that date.

His preference appeared to be for an underpass through the building, so Officer Bultstra had gone to head him off. His intention had been to grab the man and arrest him."

He had looked Officer Bultstra straight in the eye and said: “So what ’ s the matter then?” ( “ En wat nou? ” ). Officer Bultstra had not seen him stick his hand inside his clothing. Seeing the gesture, Officer Bultstra had thought that the man was acting like someone who was about to draw a weapon. His common sense had told him to be on his guard. He had stepped backwards and placed his right hand on his service pistol, releasing the holster clip at the same time. He had not drawn his service pistol but had positioned himself so as to be able to do so immediately. Pointing to the man with his left hand, he had called out: “Show me your hands. Don ’ t be silly” ( “ Laat je handen zien. Doe normaal ” ). The man had then dropped his hand and resumed his earlier posture, his arms dangling next to his body. He had said: “So what is it then? What is it then?” ( “ En wat dan? En wat dan? ” ) and had walked away from Officer Bultstra. His body had still been angled towards Officer Bultstra and his eyes still directed towards him.

In view of the man ’ s behaviour he was afraid that the man might fire. Officer Bultstra had taken hold of his service weapon in both hands and, adopting a defensive position, had aimed at the man ’ s chest. He remembered shouting “Drop it” ( “ Laat vallen ” ) several times. He might have shouted other things, but he did not remember having shouted anything other than “Don ’ t be silly. Drop it ” ( “ Doe normaal. Laat vallen ” ). He had seen the man lower the hand holding the pistol alongside his body, so that the barrel was pointing towards the ground. The man had kept the front of his body turned towards Officer Bultstra, his legs slightly apart and his arms out – that is, not hanging limp – and he had kept moving his hands so that the pistol also kept changing direction. The barrel had however been kept aimed at the ground. Officer Bultstra described the man ’ s posture as that of a cowboy who could start shooting at any moment. He had felt threatened to the point where he had decided to fire should the man point his pistol at him."

Officer Bultstra could not remember how long this had taken but the time involved had been very short. The man had raised his right arm with the pistol somewhat, in a manner in which he had not yet acted. This had caused Officer Bultstra to think: “Now I will shoot.” Since the man was raising his hand and arm, Officer Bultstra was convinced that he was about to shoot; he had been building up tension in his right hand to pull the trigger of his service pistol when he had heard, on his right, a loud report that he had recognised as a pistol shot.

He had dropped his pistol in falling. He had tried, unsuccessfully, to get up. Officers Brons and Bultstra had approached the man from two sides while still keeping him covered. Having reached the man, Officer Bultstra had put up his service pistol and grabbed the man by his shoulder. He had wished to prevent the man from getting up and possibly picking up the pistol. He had been sitting next to the man. The man had been lying with his back against Officer Bultstra ’ s knees. At that point Officer Bultstra had seen Officer Brons approaching from his right.

Upon arrival, he had seen a man lying on the ground, wounded in the neck. He had seen a silver-coloured pistol lying on the ground, about one metre from the man ’ s feet. He had also spotted a police two-way radio lying on the ground, about one metre from the body at hip level. The ambulance had arrived at approximately 10.20 p.m. and its crew had emerged with a stretcher. Shortly afterwards, someone had thrust a two-way radio set into Superintendent Groenewegen ’ s hands, telling him that it was Officer Bultstra ’ s. Superintendent Groenewegen had understood that this was the set which he had seen lying on the ground."

The application was signed by Mr Hamer as the applicants ’ representative and by each of the applicants individually. They stated that the information available did not admit of the conclusion that the shooting of Moravia Ramsahai by Officer Brons was sufficiently justified. They also pointed out that certain key parts of the investigation after the shooting had been carried out by the Amsterdam/Amstelland police force – that is, Officer Brons ’ s direct colleagues – and argued on that ground that the investigation had not been “effective” and “independent”. Further complaints addressed the failure to question Officers Brons and Bultstra until several days after the event, the failure to question all the police officers who had arrived at the scene after the shooting about what had been said by Officers Brons and Bultstra, the failure to determine the precise trajectory of the bullet (which the applicants submitted would have been possible), the failure to secure gunshot residue samples from the hands of Officers Brons and Bultstra, the failure to conduct a reconstruction of the incident, and the absence from the autopsy report of drawings or photographs showing the entrance and exit wounds caused by the bullet. Reference was also made to Police Commissioner Van Riessen ’ s statement, as reported in the newspaper De Telegraaf, to the effect that he would not allow an independent inquiry, and to the fact that the Chief Public Prosecutor ( hoofdofficier van justitie ) of Amsterdam retained overall responsibility for the investigation and any decision to prosecute."

It added that if there had been more time, it might have been possible to avoid inflicting a lethal wound; however, an immediate reaction had been required in the circumstances, as had subsequently been borne out by the fact that Moravia Ramsahai ’ s pistol had had a round chambered and its hammer cocked in the firing position. This conclusion was reinforced by the available information that earlier that day he had stolen a vehicle at gunpoint and used the pistol in a threatening way on at least one other occasion, as well as by the retrospective finding of traces of alcohol and the active ingredient of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Moravia Ramsahai ’ s body.

The following is an excerpt from it:",
                "“ 2. It is important to note that there is no question of a substantive violation of Article 2 of the Convention; the Court is unanimous in finding that the police officer acted in self-defence. The Court concludes that there has been a procedural violation of Article 2 of the Convention on two points: the (excessively) late involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department in the investigation and the fact that the decision under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure not to prosecute the policemen involved was not [given in] public. As to the involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department, a few matters should be noted. The Court does not criticise the position of the National Police Internal Investigations Department in relation to the police as such; it finds explicitly that that position is consonant with the independence required by Article 2 of the Convention. However, in this case the investigation into the shooting was carried out during the first fifteen hours by police officers belonging to the same police force as the police officer who had fired the fatal shot. Only afterwards was the investigation taken over by the National Police Internal Investigations Department. The Court finds that the (independent) National Police Internal Investigations Department became involved in the investigation too late in this specific case. Since the decision of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal of 23 June 2004 in the Mercatorplein case (unpublished), the duty system of the National Police Internal Investigations Department has been improved [ aangescherpt ], so that they can be at the place of the incident sooner. The National Police Internal Investigations Department now reaches the scene of events within, on average, one hour to one hour and a half after the incident is reported. It is therefore no longer possible to conclude that the procedures now followed in the Netherlands as regards investigations into fatal shootings involving police officers are not compatible with the Convention. I am therefore of the opinion that structural changes in the existing procedures are not needed. It is, however, useful to make the procedure more precise on some points, in particular as regards the involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department. To this end, the Board of Procurators General [ College van procureurs ‑ generaal ] is drawing up a new ‘ Instruction on how to act in the event of the use of force by a (police) officer ’ [ Aanwijzing handelwijze bij geweldsaanwending (politie) ambtenaar, hereafter ‘ the Instruction ’ ], to replace [an earlier instruction]. This Instruction will explicitly provide that the National Police Internal Investigations Department shall be informed immediately [ terstond ] in cases where there has been use of force by a police officer, and that the duty officer concerned from the National Police Internal Investigations Department shall proceed to the scene of the incident as quickly as possible. Until he arrives, the local police force shall only act to freeze the situation, for example by cordoning off the scene of the incident. However, the local force will, in principle, not carry out investigative measures. This Instruction is expected to enter into force early next year.",
                "3. In a decision such as provided for in Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the complainant ’ s interest in publicity is opposed to the interest in secrecy of the person whose prosecution is sought. The starting point, for the present, is that during the phase in which a decision has yet to be taken as to whether a person is to be prosecuted, that person ’ s interest in avoiding publicity outweighs the complainant ’ s interest in publicity. Since a decision under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not concern a ‘ criminal charge ’ in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention, the requirement of publicity for such decisions does not flow from that Article. In the relevant judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, the requirement of publicity is however derived from Article 2 of the Convention. The Court takes the view that the decision should have been given in public, in view of the seriousness of the case and the fact that it concerned a person invested with public authority. It will not be possible to give effect to the judgment without amending Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

                "4. The Court finds that the Public Prosecution Department ’ s position in relation to the police is sufficiently independent. The fact that a public prosecutor is dependent on the police for the provision of information and support does not affect this finding. The Court notes in addition that the actions of the public prosecutor are subject to independent supervision by the courts. In this case the public prosecutor in charge of the case was a public prosecutor with particular responsibility for the area within which the work was carried out at Flierbosdreef police station, at which station the police officer concerned worked. I share the Court ’ s view that it is undesirable (from the point of view of independence) for a public prosecutor to maintain excessively close ties with the police force to which the police officers concerned belong. In that connection I refer to the said Instruction of the Board of Procurators General. This Instruction will provide that in cases such as the present the investigation will in no circumstances be led by a public prosecutor who maintains close ties with the district to which the police officers belong, for example the district public prosecutor. I note in addition that the Advisory Board on Police Use of Firearms [ Adviescommissie Politiëel Vuurwapengebruik ] gives advice on the follow-up to investigations into police use of firearms actually involving firing and where investigations have actually been carried out by the National Police Internal Investigations Department. The Chief Public Prosecutor is obliged to submit to the Advisory Board the decision he proposes to take. In that way a kind of ‘ second opinion ’ is built into such cases. ”",

The second happened at the Kwakoe festival site, when he forced Mr Vinodkumar Hoeseni at gunpoint to hand over his scooter.",

Under that provision, police officers could legitimately fire upon any person who did not stop after being warned and a simple warning was apparently sufficient for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to find that the use of firearms had been “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning. The Court further noted that until 2003 the wording of section 80(1)(4) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act had remained identical (see Tzekov v.

Much like section 42(1)(4), it treated as completely irrelevant the seriousness of the offence in respect of which the detainee was being kept in custody or the danger which he or she represented. Moreover, a reading of the decisions of the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court shows that they apparently considered that a verbal warning and the firing of warning shots were sufficient to find that the use of firearms was “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning (see paragraphs 25, 27, 33, 36, 40, 41, 42 and 43 above). However, the mere failure of an individual who does not otherwise appear dangerous to heed a verbal warning or stop after the firing of warning shots cannot serve as a basis for the use of deadly force against him or her (see Kakoulli v. Turkey, no. 38595/97, § 118 and 119, 22 November 2005 )."

However, without explaining why and in apparent contradiction with the provision's plain textual meaning, they construed it as allowing the police to use firearms to arrest an escaping detainee. It is not the Court's role to question the correctness of that interpretation; it must base its examination on the provisions of the domestic law as they were applied by the national authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 35, Series A no. 62, and Vasilescu v. Romania, 22 May 1998, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ III )."

In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot but confirm the conclusion that it reached in Tzekov : the legal provisions governing the use of firearms by the police in respect of individuals fleeing from detention, as interpreted and applied in the present case, were fundamentally insufficient to protect those concerned against unjustified and arbitrary encroachments on their right to life (see, mutatis mutandis, Tzekov, cited above, § 56, and Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 99 and 100, concerning the use of firearms by the military police). As the Court explained in Nachova and Others, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity; there is no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost. The principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2 requires the national legal framework regulating arrest operations to make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident. In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre ‑ eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 94 ‑ 97, with further references)."

Lithuania, nos. 70659/01 and 74371/01, §§ 79 and 80, 24 April 2008 ). The Court does not overlook the fact that Mr Karandja was killed during an unplanned operation that gave rise to developments to which the police had to react fast and without prior preparation, and understands that the authorities'obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on them (see Tzekov, cited above § 61, with further references). Nevertheless, it cannot accept that in the circumstances of the present case the police could reasonably have believed that Mr Karandja – who had been detained in connection with two non ‑ violent offences, the first of which he committed while he was still a minor (see paragraph 6 above) – was dangerous and that they needed to use firearms to immobilise him. The Court considers that in those circumstances any resort to potentially deadly force was prohibited by Article 2, regardless of the risk that Mr Karandja might escape. Recourse to such force cannot be considered as “absolutely necessary” where it is known that the person to be prevented from escaping poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence (see Nachova and Others, § 107, and Tzekov, §§ 63 and 64, both cited above)."

By basing themselves on the strict letter of that provision and on their interpretation of Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 41, 42, 43 and 46 above), the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court disregarded highly material circumstances, such as the facts that the Sergeant had no reason to believe that Mr Karandja represented a danger to anyone, that other ways of preventing Mr Karandja from fleeing might have existed, and that it was questionable whether the Sergeant was at all entitled to use a firearm to prevent him from escaping. That approach fell short of the requirements of Article 2 (see Nachova and Others, § 114, and Tzekov, § 71, both cited above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Ivan Vasilev v.

It does not seem that any serious effort was made to identify civilian eyewitnesses and take statements from them, or to find the spent cartridges from all the shots fired by Chief Sergeant G.P. Without the information that such steps could have yielded, it was not possible to check the Sergeant's account of the events, which was all the more important in view of the discrepancy between, on the one hand, his assertion that he had fired several shots, confirmed by the testing of his handgun, and, on the other hand, the fact that the gunshot residue test had turned out negative (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). Nor did the authorities try to identify – through a ballistics test or other means – the Sergeant's and Mr Karandja's exact positions at the time of the shooting. This made it impossible to determine why, if the Sergeant had been aiming for Mr Karandja's knees (see paragraphs 17 in fine and 22 above), he ended up shooting him in the back of the head. That important question was only addressed, very briefly, in the military court's decision (see paragraph 43 above). Lastly, it does not seem that any measures were taken to prevent the opportunities for collusion between the officers involved (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 330, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ). Against that background, the Court can only reiterate that a prompt and effective response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 118)."

In the present case, the Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 for the death of the applicant's son.

Where violations of the rights enshrined in Article 2 are alleged, compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage should in principle be possible as part of the range of redress available (see Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 97; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 109; and T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 107, ECHR 2001-V). On the other hand, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to “private revenge” (see Perez, cited above, § 70). What is important is the impact the State's failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 2 had on the deceased's family's access to other available and effective remedies for establishing liability on the part of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions entailing the breach of their rights under Article 2 and, as appropriate, obtaining compensation ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 148 )."

Without such an investigation, the individual concerned may not be in a position to use any remedy available to him for obtaining relief, given that the knowledge necessary to elucidate facts such as those in issue in the instant case is often in the sole hands of State officials or authorities. Accordingly, the Court's task under Article 13 is to determine whether the applicant's exercise of an effective remedy was frustrated on account of the manner in which the authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 90, 93-94 and 149 )."

The scheme chosen by the authorities following a comparative feasibility study provided for the construction of a feed-through mud retention collector. Construction work began, but in 1960 this was disrupted by an exceptionally strong mudslide, and the project had to be corrected and extended accordingly. The construction of the collector was finished in 1965 and operated successfully for 35 years, apparently providing sufficient defence against the mudslides. In 1977 a technical review was carried out following a particularly strong mudslide which seriously damaged some sections of the collector, and it was considered necessary to carry out repair work.

The funding for the completion of the construction had been allocated, but as to where the funds had disappeared (between Nalchik and Tyrnauz ), nobody could give me a clear answer. Stressing the importance of this issue and the need to complete the construction, I made numerous appeals to the [KBR President], V. Kokov, and to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the Russian Federation, S. Shoigu. Finally more funds were allocated and the construction was ostensibly brought to completion. ... I refused to take part in the [inaugural ceremony] because of concern for my expert and academic reputation. My assistant specialists, in particular my deputy for the construction [Mr R.] and the geologist [Ms N.S.] drew up a report; here are some extracts from it:'... a failure to submit [project documentation] makes it impossible to assess the project's compliance [with the specifications] ... Given the novelty of the [design] ... the high levels of seismic activity in the area, the high fail-safety requirements for the dam structure, any deformation of which may increase the impact of a mudslide on the town of Tyrnauz and thus significantly aggravate the mud hazard, and also taking into account the inordinate time taken to complete the construction work, with intervals as long as four years, it is necessary to subject the facility to a special architectural survey. [A number of serious technical deviations] give grounds for suspecting a degree of tension within the construction, even without mud or seismic impact. All of this considerably reduces the project capacity of the dam. The visual survey of the dam construction showed signs of wear and tear of sections of it even without mud ...'",

                "G.Y.: So all of this may happen as unexpectedly as on 18 June 2000?",
                "V.B.: Here we can be certain that the situation has radically improved. The present position is that even before the beginning of the period when the mud is active, surveillance posts have been set up in the immediate vicinity of the glacier as well as [further down] where the mudslide gains force and becomes dangerous for the town.",
                "The [surveillance] posts are functioning and are provided with reliable communication facilities. That is to say, in so far as prevention is concerned, measures have been taken ... The second important problem is ... to close the twist in the mud conveying channel with a more secure wall. Work has been under way for some time. ...",
                "To sum up ... the mud activity in this gorge has increased because of last year's mudslide. At the same time the preventive measures that have already been taken inspire optimism. In any event, even if powerful mudslides develop, people's lives will undoubtedly be saved.",
                "G.Y.: Are there any effective methods of influencing the mud activity, for example by blowing up part of a slope or draining a glacier lake, so that the risk of a mudslide is reduced?",
                "V.B.: Yes, there are. ... but [their application] involves very complex and thorough calculations ... This question is currently being examined ... then it will be for the specialists and the authorities to decide whether to use this technology in the Gerhozhansu ...",
                "... At the same time in a number of mud-affected areas it is necessary to solve the question of [resettling the residents] outside the zone of mud activity in order to ensure [their] safety. This would be much cheaper and quicker. Engineering schemes involve tremendous expenditure, and given that funds are always lacking, are unlikely to offer a solution. Therefore, introducing restrictions in the mud-affected zones and regulating [building] within them, especially of a residential nature, is worth considering.”"

On the previous night I arrived in town late and went straight to bed ... unaware of what was happening in the town. At 7.30 a.m. on the morning of 19 July, I went out and saw people gathered on the mountain ... and found out that a mudslide had hit Fatima's house ... The bridge had been destroyed and I could not cross to the other side where her house was. I decided to enquire after Fatima and went to the home of her sister Khalimat [the first applicant], who lives on this side. I saw the police nearby and asked them if I could go to this house [pointing at the first applicant's house] and they confirmed that I could, adding that the electricity had been switched back on two hours previously, and people were allowed back in their flats. I headed there with no apprehension, went up to the sixth floor ... walked in and found them asleep. I woke up Khalimat and she told me that on the previous night Fatima had crossed to the other side of the river. We had been talking for about 15 minutes when we heard a loud rumble. I rushed out to the balcony and saw people running. Khalimat also rushed to wake up her husband and children. I grabbed their youngest son, three - year - old Inar, and ran downstairs. On my way out I saw Khalimat's husband [Vladimir] looking for his trousers and Khalimat herself following me with her eldest son Magomed. Between the third and fourth floors I felt the stairs pitching and realised that the house was collapsing. We fell and I found myself locked with the child under a [concrete sheet] with dust, blood and debris around me. I pushed Inar up between the sheets so that he could get out. A man saw him and pulled him out but I stayed under the sheet. I could feel my legs but could not see them ... they were buried under a concrete sheet ... I later saw three dead bodies underneath the same sheet (a woman and two children of about three to five years of age). I tried to pull my legs out but felt an awful pain in the pelvis ... Eventually I was helped out by the emergency services and taken to hospital ... For two months I was immobilised and continued to receive treatment for a further nine months ...",

Every time I applied [to the authorities for medical or welfare benefits] I was asked why I had gone there in the first place, to which I could only answer that nobody had stopped me or warned me that it was dangerous; on the contrary, they had told me that I could go in ... I am a reasonable person and would never have headed towards the danger if only I had been warned ... ”"

We rushed out dressed in whatever we were wearing. It was raining heavily, people were running in fear and panic in all directions. The rest of the night we spent up in the mountains, trembling with cold and fear. In the morning, we saw the awful spectacle of the town partly covered in mud and rocks with some areas, especially Otarova Street, destroyed by the mud, and the centre flooded with water from the Baksan River.",

All the residents of our apartment block and of the two neighbouring nine-storey apartment blocks returned to their flats. We ate and went to sleep. I woke up because the house was shaking and I heard the noise and people screaming. I opened the door and saw that the right side of our house was missing and the staircase had collapsed. I grabbed my grandson and ran out to the balcony where the fire exit was. We could only make it to the fourth floor where the fire staircase ended; there were about 30 of us gathered there, while people from the lower floors were jumping out of their windows and balconies, which I could see. My neighbours, the men, found some ropes and began taking us down, the children first and then the women. It took me a while to come to my senses after the descent. My neighbour, [the first applicant], was crying and asking about her husband and child. But nobody knew what had become of them and the rest of us were also looking for our relatives. After these events we were in a state of shock for a long time, but no one paid any attention to us. The authorities still do not admit that they were not actually in control of the situation and that nothing had been done to save us from the disaster. They had taken no measures before the mudslide, or while it continued from 18 to 25 July, basically leaving us to our own devices. In our apartment block alone four people were killed and many were injured and remained disabled for life; it is a pity, especially about the children. Nobody knows how many people in fact died, in particular on the night of 18 July, as these facts have been vigorously concealed. We did not bring proceedings with a view to punishing those who were really responsible for everything we had had to endure, because we were sure that the court would never give a just ruling as these people occupy very high posts.”"

At our meeting he said that he had no money to clear the waterway, as no funds had been allocated, so there was nothing he could do for us. We suggested writing a letter to the government requesting the funds, but he began shouting at us that the government had enough work to deal with without us.

The Court further notes that the events complained of in the present case were of such a vast scale that bringing the matter to the attention of the authorities did not depend on the applicant's diligence. Moreover, the advantage to be gained by the applicant in instituting criminal proceedings was not obvious, given that the civil court had competence to engage the responsibility of a particular State authority, and such institutional liability could have provided a basis for reparation to the victims. This consideration is essential given that disasters of this kind are more likely to result from a combined failure of a number of officials, whose individual liability does not necessarily attain the gravity required for a criminal conviction. For this reason and also due to lower standards of proof in civil proceedings, the Court does not find it unreasonable on the part of the first applicant to choose a civil action as means of seeking redress."

Concerning the decision dispensing with criminal proceedings, the applicants deny any knowledge that such decision has been adopted. Indeed, they were not involved in any such proceedings and it is unclear in what capacity under domestic law they would have been able to challenge the decision referred to by the Government. Unlike the first applicant, they had to prove their victim status before they could commence criminal proceedings.

Turning to the applicants'specific complaints, the Court observes that they accused the authorities of having allowed three major shortcomings in the functioning of the system for protection against natural hazards in Tyrnauz, which led to casualties and losses in July 2000. Firstly, they alleged a negligent failure to maintain mud-protection engineering facilities, notably to restore the mud-retention dam damaged in 1999 and to clear the mud-retention collector blocked by the leftover debris. Secondly, they complained about the lack of a public warning about the approaching disaster that would help to avoid casualties, injuries and mass panic. Finally, they complained that these events, despite their scale and devastating consequences, did not give rise to an enquiry that would assess the effectiveness of the authorities'conduct before and during the mudslide, in particular whether everything possible had been done to mitigate the damage.

The regular occurrence of this calamity in the summer season and the prior existence of defence schemes designed to protect the area indicate that the authorities and the population reasonably assumed that a mudslide was likely in the summer of 2000. This is in fact not in dispute between the parties. What they disagree on is the authorities'prior knowledge that the mudslide in 2000 was likely to cause devastation on a larger scale than usual."

The Court notes that in the year immediately preceding the mudslide of August 2000 the authorities of the KBR received a number of warnings that should have made them aware of the increasing risks. The first warning, issued in 30 August 1999 by the competent surveillance agency, the Mountain Institute, informed the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR about the need to repair the mud-protection dam, damaged by a strong mudslide, and calling for the setting -up of an early warning system that would allow the timely evacuation of civilians in the event of a mudslide. The second warning from the same agency was sent on 17 January 2000 to the Prime Minister of the KBR. It stated that even if restoration of the dam was not feasible, it was indispensible to set up observation posts to ensure the functioning of the warning system in the summer of 2000. The next warning was sent by the Head of the Elbrus District Administration to the Prime Minister of the KBR on 7 March 2000. This warning restated the previous ones and, moreover, referred to possible record losses and casualties in the event of a failure to take the indicated measures. Finally, on 7 July 2000 the Mountain Institute sent another warning to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR calling for urgent installation of the observation posts."

It is also clear that there was no ambiguity about the scope or the timing of the work that needed to be performed. However, the Government gave no reasons why no such steps were taken. On the basis of the documents submitted by the applicant, it appears that after the 1999 mudslide there was no allocation of funds for these purposes (see paragraph 3 8 above). It follows from the Government's observations that such funds were only made available after the 2000 disaster.

This is contested by the applicants, who claimed that there had been no sign of any evacuation order when they were returning to their flats. They submitted witness statements confirming that people who returned to their homes on 19 July 2000 saw no warning against doing so.

By the beginning of the mudslide season the authorities thus found themselves short of means to estimate the time, force or probable duration of the mudslide.

The information submitted in response related exclusively to the creation of the mud-retention dam and the mud-retention collector, facilities that, as the Court has established above, were not adequately maintained.

Indeed, the applicants'claims for damages were dismissed precisely for the failure to do so (see paragraphs 49-50, 60, 67, 76 and 85 above). However, this question could only be answered, if at all, by a complex expert investigation involving the assessment of technical and administrative aspects, as well as by obtaining factual information available to the authorities alone.

It also reiterates that genuine, effective exercise of the right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not depend merely on the State's duty not to interfere, but may require positive measures of protection, particularly where there is a direct link between the measures an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and his effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Bielectric S.r.l. v. Italy (dec.), no. 36811/97, 4 May 2000, and Öneryıldız, cited above, § 134 )."

In the context of the State's positive obligation in the sphere of dangerous activities, the Court has found that the causal link established between the gross negligence attributable to the State and the loss of human lives also applied to the engulfment of the applicant's house (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). It considered that in a situation where lives and property were lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, the scope of measures required for the protection of dwellings was indistinguishable from the scope of those to be taken in order to protect the lives of the residents. Treatment of waste, a matter relating to industrial development and urban planning, is regulated and controlled by the State, which brings accidents in this sphere within its responsibility. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the authorities were required to do everything within their power to protect private proprietary interests (ibid.)."

For this reason the Court considers that for the purposes of the present case a distinction must be drawn between the positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention and those under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. While the fundamental importance of the right to life requires that the scope of the positive obligations under Article 2 includes a duty to do everything within the authorities'power in the sphere of disaster relief for the protection of that right, the obligation to protect the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, which is not absolute, cannot extend further than what is reasonable in the circumstances. Accordingly, the authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take in order to protect individuals'possessions from weather hazards than in deciding on the measures needed to protect lives."

Moreover, the extent of the material damage attributable to State negligence might not be susceptible to accurate evaluation in circumstances of outstanding complexity, as in the present case. In fact, providing redress by means of tort action may not always be the most appropriate response to a large-scale calamity. Considerations of urgency and efficiency may lead the authorities to give priority to other general and individual measures, such as providing emergency assistance and allotting benefits to all victims irrespective of the actual losses."

In so far as the applicants argued that these benefits did not fully cover their pecuniary losses, the Court observes that the terms of compensation have previously been found an essential element in cases concerning the taking of property under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court found that while the absence of compensation would usually be incompatible with this provision, it does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, § 48, ECHR 199 9-II )."

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance, and notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Former King of Greece and Others v.

The Court considers that the positive obligation on the State to protect private property from natural disasters cannot be construed as binding the State to compensate the full market value of destroyed property. In the present case, the damage in its entirety could not be unequivocally attributed to State negligence, and the alleged negligence was no more than an aggravating factor contributing to the damage caused by natural forces. In such circumstances the terms of compensation must be assessed in the light of all the other measures implemented by the authorities, account being taken of the complexity of the situation, the number of affected owners, and the economic, social and humanitarian issues inherent in the provision of disaster relief."

The Court observes that the disaster relief payable to the mudslide victims under the directive of 12 August 2000 entitled the applicants to free housing and an allowance of RUB 13,200 (then an equivalent of about 530 euros ). The victims had equal, direct and automatic access to these benefits, which did not involve a contentious procedure or a need to prove the actual losses. As regards the first, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth applicants, the size of the free housing they received was equivalent to their perished flats. As regards the second applicant, she opted to receive free housing vouchers issued on the basis of the number of family members. She applied as a single-person family and received a voucher for 33 sq. m, as opposed to the 54 sq. m that she could have received had she applied as a family of three. She did not elaborate on the reasons for doing so. As regards the third applicant, she initially received monetary compensation that took account of the size of the perished flats. However, she later exchanged this for a housing voucher, with which she bought housing in the Moscow region which she resold shortly afterwards. Since she did not disclose the details of this transaction, the Court cannot assess her resulting losses or benefits."

Given the importance of this asset, the large number of affected persons and the scale of emergency relief to be handled by the authorities in such circumstances, the cap of RUB 13,200 on compensation for household belongings appears justified. In sum, the Court considers that the conditions under which victims were granted compensation for possessions lost in the mudslide did not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicants."

Its object is to provide a means whereby individuals can obtain appropriate relief at national level for violations of their Convention rights before having to set in motion the international machinery of complaint before the Court (see Kudła v.

On the other hand, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to “private revenge” (see Perez, cited above, § 70). What is important is the impact the State's failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 2 had on the deceased's family's access to other available and effective remedies for establishing liability on the part of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions entailing the breach of their rights under Article 2 and, as appropriate, obtaining compensation ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 148 )."

Without such an investigation, the individual concerned may not be in a position to use any remedy available to him for obtaining relief, given that the knowledge necessary to elucidate facts such as those in issue in the instant case is often in the sole hands of State officials or authorities. Accordingly, the Court's task under Article 13 is to determine whether the applicant's exercise of an effective remedy was frustrated on account of the manner in which the authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 90, 93-94 and 149 )."

Moreover, the Court has held above that it would not be appropriate to impose an absolute obligation on the State to evaluate material damage and to assume tort liability in the circumstances where it implemented measures through the general scheme of emergency relief (see paragraph 178 above). In view of these factors taken into account by the domestic courts, their refusal to award the applicants damages in the part not covered by the disaster victims'benefits they received cannot be considered unreasonable or arbitrary.

The Regional Court found, inter alia, that on 8 October 1998 the first applicant and his brother had been taken to a police station, where the police officers had ill-treated the first applicant in order to extract a confession. When the first applicant had refused to confess, one of the police officers had kicked and punched him and then unlawfully detained him at the police station. Later that day, two of the police officers had continued beating the first applicant. One of them had slapped his ears with both hands, as a result of which his left eardrum exploded. They had then brought a bottle in and tried to sit the first applicant on it. Simultaneously, another police officer had been beating the first applicant’s brother in a nearby office and the first applicant had heard his brother’s cries. Realising that he had no other way of avoiding the ill-treatment, the first applicant had confessed to the murder. The next day, before taking the first applicant to the scene of the crime for an inspection, one of the police officers had punched him several times as a warning. Thereafter, on 14, 16 and 19 October 1998 the first applicant had been taken from his detention cell to the police station, where the police officers had continued ill-treating him in order to make him confess to having raped the victim before murdering her, which the first applicant was forced to do, because he was unable to endure the ill-treatment."

                "“22. This Article provides that compensation shall be paid to a victim of a miscarriage of justice, on certain conditions.",
                "First, the person concerned has to have been convicted of a criminal offence by a final decision and to have suffered punishment as a result of such conviction. According to the definition contained in the Explanatory Report of the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments, a decision is final ‘if, according to the traditional expression, it has acquired the force of res judicata. This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them’. It follows therefore that a judgment by default is not considered as final as long as the domestic law allows the proceedings to be taken up again. Likewise, this Article does not apply in cases where the charge is dismissed or the accused person is acquitted either by the court of first instance or, on appeal, by a higher tribunal. If, however, in one of the States in which such a possibility is provided for, the person has been granted leave to appeal after the normal time of appealing has expired, and his conviction is then reversed on appeal, then subject to the other conditions of the Article, in particular the conditions described in paragraph 24 below, the Article may apply.",
                "23. Secondly, the Article applies only where the person’s conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned, in either case on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice – that is, some serious failure in the judicial process involving grave prejudice to the convicted person. Therefore, there is no requirement under the Article to pay compensation if the conviction has been reversed or a pardon has been granted on some other ground. Nor does the Article seek to lay down any rules as to the nature of the procedure to be applied to establish a miscarriage of justice. This is a matter for the domestic law or practice of the State concerned. The words ‘or he has been pardoned’ have been included because under some systems of law pardon, rather than legal proceedings leading to the reversal of a conviction, may in certain cases be the appropriate remedy after there has been a final decision.",
                "24. Finally, there is no right to compensation under this provision if it can be shown that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted.",
                "25. In all cases in which these preconditions are satisfied, compensation is payable ‘according to the law or the practice of the State concerned’. This does not mean that no compensation is payable if the law or practice makes no provision for such compensation. It means that the law or practice of the State should provide for the payment of compensation in all cases to which the Article applies. The intention is that States would be obliged to compensate persons only in clear cases of miscarriage of justice, in the sense that there would be acknowledgment that the person concerned was clearly innocent. The Article is not intended to give a right of compensation where all the preconditions are not satisfied, for example, where an appellate court had quashed a conviction because it had discovered some fact which introduced a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused and which had been overlooked by the trial judge.”",

The applicant’s arrest and detention at the material time were not in violation of Article 5, since the domestic courts had acted in accordance with the law. There was no violation of Article 5 § 1 (a) since the applicant had been convicted by a competent court and there was no violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) since the aim of arresting the applicant had been to bring him before a competent authority on suspicion of having committed rape and murder. At the material time the domestic court had not had at its disposal any evidence that would justify adopting a different decision. There had been no violation of Article 5 § 2 because the applicant had signed the record of his arrest on the day he was taken to the police station, so had evidently been aware of the reason for his arrest.

Furthermore, the General Prosecutor had sent an official apology to the applicant for the miscarriage of justice. All those measures should be considered sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered. Moreover, the facts of the present case were different from those in Keenan v. the United Kingdom (no. 27229/95, § 130, ECHR 2001 ‑ III) and Kontrová v.

In particular, he had been awarded compensation for pecuniary damage and had received an official apology from the General Prosecutor’s Office, which should be considered as sufficient compensation for the non-pecuniary damage. Furthermore, Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 required the payment of compensation according to the law or practice of the State concerned. Thus, the compensation – in the form of an apology – which he had received for non-pecuniary damage had not been arbitrary, since such a practice was common in similar situations."

            [
                "41. The applicant argued that Articles 3, 5 and 6 were applicable to his case and that an award of just compensation was therefore of paramount importance. The apology which he had received could not be taken seriously because, in addition to the official letter, the General Prosecutor had presented him with a copy of Alexandre Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo. In any case, the hardship, mental anguish and acute physical pain he had suffered for five and a half years deserved to be compensated in a more reasonable manner than just an apology. Furthermore, on 1 September every year of his detention Armenian State television had broadcast a programme prepared by the Armenian police affirming that he had admitted his guilt. Thus, he had been consistently degraded in the eyes of the public and nothing had been done by the authorities after his acquittal to restore his reputation. In 2007 he had married, but was still unable to have a child. The doctors attributed this to the circumstances of his conviction. He also suffered from adhesive otitis media in his left eardrum and first- to second-degree bilateral perceptive deafness on account of the blows to his ears. He was still using painkillers and his deafness was irreversible. No compensation for this had been awarded by the domestic courts, despite the fact that it had been established that he had suffered ill-treatment. Lastly, the Government’s argument that his arrest had been effected in accordance with Article 5 and had been based on a reasonable suspicion was unacceptable, since the signs of his ill-treatment were clearly visible on his person. Furthermore, he had persistently refused to admit to the charges against him before the courts and had appealed to the higher instances against his conviction."

However, it reiterates that the existence of an actual breach of another provision of the Convention is not a prerequisite for the application of Article 13. Article 13 guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce – and hence to allege non-compliance with – the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. Thus, for Article 13 to apply it is sufficient for an individual to have an arguable claim in terms of the Convention (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, § 52, Series A no. 131)."

The applicant stated that his four relatives had been killed in Grozny in January 2000 by the military. He had found their bodies and had transported them with great difficulty to Ingushetia, where they were buried. A criminal investigation was opened, but failed to establish the servicemen responsible for the killings. Witness Nikolay G. testified to the court that he lived in the Staropromyslovskiy district not far from the applicant's family. In January 2000, about a month after the federal troops had established firm control over the district, he saw the servicemen leading Khamid Khashiyev and two of his nephews towards the garages. They were walking in front of an armoured personnel carrier ( APC ); armed soldiers were sitting on its hull. Soon afterwards he heard automatic rifle shots from the garages. When he attempted to go there, soldiers threatened him. He also submitted that he was threatened by someone from the prosecutor's office to “keep his mouth shut”. Other witnesses testified about the circumstances in which the bodies were discovered in Grozny, transported to Ingushetia and buried, and about the state of the bodies prior to burial."

At that time only federal soldiers were able to travel about town on an APC and to conduct identity checks. That Lidiya Khashiyeva and Anzor Taymeskhanov had been killed during an identity check was corroborated by the fact that their bodies were found in the courtyard of their house with identity documents in their hands.

The Supreme Court's published case-law did not contain a single example of a civil case brought against the state authorities by a victim of the armed conflict in Chechnya. As to a possible transfer of cases by the Supreme Court, the applicants referred to a decision by the Constitutional Court of 16 March 1998, which found that the relevant provisions of the then Code of Civil Procedure, permitting higher courts to transfer cases from one court to another, were unconstitutional.

What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.

Turkey judgment, cited above, p. 324, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Ögur v. Turkey, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means.

[the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see the Assenov and Others judgment cited above, p. 3290, § 102; Labita v.

Failure to identify and question other possible witnesses of the events that occurred in the Staropromyslovskiy district on 19 and 20 January 2000 and the servicemen of the military units deployed there at the time also possibly prevented any concrete evidence of ill-treatment coming to light and thereby the identification and punishment of those responsible.

However, these developments took place some years after the X. and Others case, which at the time gave the impression that the highest judicial authority had ruled out the possibility of suing local authorities in the exercise of their child protection functions on grounds of public policy.

The children attended school regularly and appeared happily settled. W.H. was recorded as admitting the offence and as being more than ashamed of his conduct, though he could offer no explanation for these actions. It was noted that he did not appear to realise fully the serious nature of these charges. Since the alleged offence he had obtained accommodation outside the applicants’ home - it indicated an address in the same apartment block.

The first incident which she recalled was when she was 6 or 7 when he struck her, sending her flying into the wall. Soon after, he began coming into her room at night and doing things to her, requiring her to masturbate him. If she cried, he would punch her in the face. From the age of 12, he used to make the girls have a bath together and would touch them all over their bodies, inserting his finger into them. Often he would keep her off school and would abuse her sexually. He assaulted her often, coming up behind her to hit her on the back of the head. He also used to stand on her naked feet with his shoes on and twist, pinch her with his nails and punch her. This physical abuse happened on a daily basis. He would also get her and the others to strip to the waist and hit each other with dog chains. This conduct continued regularly until she left home on her 17 th birthday ( 19 October 1977 ). She recalled going to the social services when she was aged 14 and telling them that W.H. was living with them when he was not supposed to. Nothing happened as a result. While the social services were coming to the house, she did not remember them talking to her. She recalled that this period was before she was 14 or 15, before 1974 or 1975. When she was 15, she started running away from home. On one occasion she took pills. When she was visited by the police in hospital, she told them that W.H. was interfering with her. She also told this to a psychiatrist whom she saw soon after. However, W.H. continued interfering with her. W.H. was only arrested after L. had run away from home in January 1977. E. had suffered serious problems since that time, having made several suicide attempts and having developed a severe drink problem. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder.",

From about the age of 6 or 7, W.H. used to punch him in the stomach and bash him against the wall. He also made him and the others strip to the waist and punch and hit each other with chains. These relentless assaults went on regularly until he left home during 1978. A psychiatric report of 9 June 1992 concluded that he had long term relationship problems, poor self confidence and long standing personality difficulties.",
                "(iii) L. stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from W.H. from 1969 until she left home in about 1979 and on occasion after that. W.H. had started interfering with her when she was about 5 or 6. The first thing she remembered was him bathing her with her sister E. and rubbing her private parts. Hardly a day went past when he did not do something of a sexual nature to her (e.g. touching her breasts or private parts) or batter her. When she was older, he made her touch him on his private parts and perform oral sex. He made her and the other children hit each other with chains and whips and would sometimes join in. She was often left with bad bruises and a bleeding nose. From the age of 11 or 12, he had sexual intercourse with her several times. When she ran away in January 1977, she told the police and he was arrested. However, he returned home and started interfering with her again, having intercourse with her and punching or kicking her if she refused. She ran away again in Spring 1977 and was put into a home, first in Dumfries, then Annan and finally Closeburn, which she eventually left in 1979 when she was 16. At that point, she did not return home but went to stay with her sister and then embarked in a series of relationships. When she visited her mother on 1 January 1980, W.H. put his hands up her skirt but let her go when she threatened to tell her boyfriend. On another occasion in 1981, W.H. tried to fondle her but she got up and left. She had never been able to tell anyone about these things as she was scared of him and thought that he would severely assault her. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms, including nightmares and sleep disturbance, accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder.",
                "(iv) T. stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from W.H. from about 1971 to 1989. Though she did not remember anything specifically before the age of 9, she slept in the same bed as L. and remembered him coming naked into the bed with them. From an early age, he used to stand on her naked feet in his shoes and twirl round, nip her and punch her in the stomach. She had black eyes occasionally. When she was 9, she remembered him making her touch him and masturbate him. She had to do that to him two or three times a week when he came home from work. He then started keeping her off school and would lie down on the bed naked, making her take her clothes off and masturbate him. This occurred two or three times a week. When she was 10 or 11, he began to touch her breasts and rub his penis over her until he ejaculated. When she was 14, he forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. He did not repeat that but continued touching her and making her masturbate him or have oral sex. This continued until 1984 when she was able to leave home – she deliberately got pregnant by having sex with someone she knew, so that the local authority would provide her with accommodation away from home. In 1987, W.H. started coming to her house and would try to touch and grab her. She became very depressed and suicidal. She then told the Family Centre about the abuse. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms, including low self-esteem, fear, mistrust and depression, accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder."

Little or no attention was given to the needs of the victim and once the perpetrator was convicted that would be seen as the end of the matter. There was no real appreciation of the extent to which abusers might continue to abuse their victims over many years or of the skills of abusers in avoiding detection. Social workers were not given any specific training about child sex abuse. There was also the practice at the time of local authorities keeping their probation and child care functions separate, with social workers working separately rather than as part of a team and there was a tendency for there to be relatively little interaction between schools and social work departments."

A mere suspicion that the W.H. was in breach of the probation order, and his presence found in the house during the day, would not have been sufficient proof of breach. He was the father of two of the mother’s youngest children, contact with the family was not prohibited and his presence in the house would have even been seen as positive. Even if they had considered the possible breach of probation further, they would not have gone on to consider possible harm to the children. It would have been standard practice to make specific appointments to visit the home in order to avoid wasted time and she would not have expected the social worker to make spot checks or call at unexpected times to check on W.H.. As was the practice, social services provided support for the mother who had considerable problems in running the home, and would have had a tendency not to investigate the causes of any running away or of truancy, particularly where the child was close to school leaving age.

The school problems drawn to the attention of the social services did not appear to have prompted the social worker to suggest a meeting to try to draw together the issues for the family and this meant that the full extent of the problems that L. and the others in the family faced were not discussed by the wider group of professionals who knew the family.

Nor was there any social work follow-up when L. ran away in January 1977, beyond a visit of the emergency social worker, or any discussion with E. and L. after W.H. had been sentenced. Even if social workers at the time were not aware of the incidence of sexual abuse, the incidents with the two girls and the evident distress shown by them should have usefully led to an attempt to discuss with them individually how things were at home, in particular to establish the severity of past incidents and whether any other children in the house were at risk of sexual or physical abuse."

Mr R. did not appear to have issued any warning to them about the consequences of breaching the probation order. When the report was made on E. in June 1977 there was no reference to the sexual abuse or home difficulties. Also the report to the Children’s Hearing on L. in January 1978 failed to give a full picture of her difficulties. Throughout the case there was an emerging pattern of different people not using the information available to assess the safety of the girls and W.H.’s adherence to the probation conditions. After the report on E. in June, it could have been expected that the workers involved in the family would have increased their scrutiny of the living arrangements in the family. The lack of detail in the reports on L. deprived the Children’s Hearing of vital information which could have led them to place L. on supervision and afforded more opportunity for her to speak about the home situation."

This would have given an opportunity for all the different agencies involved with the family to contribute to the discussion and for the Hearing to appreciate the full extent of the problems. Though L. might not have been removed in the first instances, a supervision requirement would have allowed closer contact and more individual work.

When an offender is placed on probation he is allowed to retain his liberty during the period of probation but must comply with the requirements of the probation order.

Other requirements may be imposed, such as conditions as to the place of residence. If the offender fails to comply with requirements of the probation order, that failure may be reported to the sentencing court by the supervisory officer or other responsible officials of the Social Work Department. The supervising officer has a degree of discretion where there is an apparent breach of the order. He may warn the probationer about the conduct if he considers a warning is likely to alter the probationer’s behaviour. If he reports the matter to the court, the court then investigates the matter.

Even if the social services were not aware he was inflicting abuse at this time, they should have been aware that the children remained at potential risk. The fact that at the relevant time there was not the knowledge of the prevalence of, and persistence of, sexual offenders victimising children within a family that there exists now, is not significant in this case where, as the applicants emphasise, the social services knew that there had been incidences of sexual abuse resulting in criminal offences and were under an obligation to monitor the offender’s conduct in the aftermath of the conviction."

Where the damage was caused directly by a perpetrator of abuse and the liability of the local authority was subsidiary or derivative, the requirement for compensation could be met through remedies against the abuser himself or by the State providing awards under a compensation scheme such as the CICB. The applicants could also have obtained a determination of liability through judicial review proceedings, civil proceedings against the local authority (which they chose to withdraw) and the local authority ombudsman. It was not apparent that the applicants’ civil claims would have been rejected for lack of a cause of action as they arguably raised operational matters not affected by the ruling in the X. and Others case, though in the Government’s view it would have failed on the merits.

In addition, in this context, the Court finds disturbing the approach of the Supreme Administrative Court on the question whether or not the alleged risks of ill-treatment and death in the event of Mr M.’s deportation to Afghanistan rendered the deportation order unlawful.

This approach appears deficient on two levels. First, it seems to place excessive reliance on the question whether the ill ‑ treatment risked in the receiving State would emanate from State or non ‑ State sources, whereas, in accordance with the Court’s established case ‑ law, this issue, albeit relevant, cannot be decisive (see, among others, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, §§ 163-165, 26 July 2005, and Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, §§ 137-149, ECHR 2007-I). Second, by dealing with such a serious issue summarily and by placing on the first applicant, without any explanation, the burden of proving negative facts, such as the lack of State guarantees in Afghanistan, the court practically deprived Mr M. of a meaningful examination of his claim under Article 3. The Court reiterates in this connection that in view of the importance which it attaches to Article 3 of the Convention and the irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of ill-treatment materialises, the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 imperatively requires independent and rigorous scrutiny by a national authority of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 293, 21 January 2011, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "128. Finally, the Court notes with concern that yet another aspect of the requirements of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 was not complied with by the Bulgarian authorities. It observes that under Bulgarian law, whenever the executive chooses to mention national security as the grounds for a deportation order, appeals against such an order have no suspensive effect, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill-treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 16 and 50 above). Moreover, at least until September 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court held that under Bulgarian law there was no possibility of staying the enforcement of a deportation order issued on national security grounds (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In the present case, it appears that the first applicant’s request for a stay of his deportation pending the judicial review proceedings was left practically unexamined (see paragraph 29 above). Before the Court’s decision to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Mr M. could have been deported to Afghanistan at any moment and without a prior independent examination of his claim that such deportation would expose him to a serious risk to his life or physical integrity. While this did not happen (apparently, partly for reasons beyond the Bulgarian authorities’ control and partly because of delays in their actions (see paragraphs 69-75 above)), the issue to be examined is whether or not the available domestic remedies met the requirement of effectiveness under Article 13 and the Court’s case-law. Those requirements take the form of a guarantee and cannot be deemed to have been satisfied by a de facto arrangement (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, § 66)."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court reiterates that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy may prevent the execution of measures that are contrary to the Convention and whose effects are potentially irreversible. Consequently, it is inconsistent with Article 13 for such measures to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 79, ECHR 2002-I, and Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 153). In the context of deportation, the domestic remedy for examination of allegations about serious risks of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country must have automatic suspensive effect (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, §§ 58 and 66, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], cited above, § 293). As the prohibition provided by Article 3 against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is of an absolute character, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 138, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...). By choosing to rely on national security in a deportation order the authorities cannot do away with effective remedies (see Al-Nashif, cited above, § 137)."

            [
                "130. In the light of the above-cited case-law, the Court considers that where there is an arguable claim about a substantial risk of death or ill ‑ treatment there can be no justification for a legal regime under which – as here – suspensive effect is denied as a matter of principle to appeals against a certain category of deportation orders. It finds that the Bulgarian law and practice in relation to stays of enforcement of deportation orders issued on purported national security grounds are incompatible with Article 13 as they do not guarantee automatic suspension of enforcement and do not secure a substantive, rigorous and independent examination of claims under Article 3 of the Convention prior to deportation."

The Court considers that this legal regime and practice may be seen as problematic with regard to the requirement of legal certainty, inherent in all Convention provisions. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, legal certainty must be strictly complied with in respect of each and every element relevant to the justification of the detention under domestic and Convention law.

In particular, the legal significance of the existence of two orders is unclear.

In the present case the deportation order against Mr M. was based on a declaratory statement, contained in an internal document of the National Security Service of the Ministry of the Interior, according to which he was involved in trafficking of migrants and therefore represented a national security threat. This document, which has not been submitted to the Court, apparently did not mention the factual grounds and the evidence on which the declaration was based. As in the other similar cases against Bulgaria, it has not been alleged that Mr M. has ever been charged with related offences. Thus, the deportation order was issued on the basis of a purely internal assessment of undisclosed information. Furthermore, just as it did in the other cases cited above, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal against the deportation order, considering itself bound by the above-mentioned declaratory statement. The court held that the governmental agency which had issued the statement had some sort of certification power, which had to be respected unconditionally. The court thus refused to inquire whether the allegations against Mr M. had any objective basis (see paragraphs 11, 24, 25 and 31 above)."

Firstly, they did not involve meaningful scrutiny of the executive’s allegations.

            [
                "127. In addition, in this context, the Court finds disturbing the approach of the Supreme Administrative Court on the question whether or not the alleged risks of ill-treatment and death in the event of Mr M.’s deportation to Afghanistan rendered the deportation order unlawful. In particular, while it apparently acknowledged the existence of such risks, the court placed on the first applicant the burden of proving that they stemmed from the Afghan authorities and that those authorities would not guarantee his safety (see paragraph 33 above). This approach appears deficient on two levels. First, it seems to place excessive reliance on the question whether the ill ‑ treatment risked in the receiving State would emanate from State or non ‑ State sources, whereas, in accordance with the Court’s established case ‑ law, this issue, albeit relevant, cannot be decisive (see, among others, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, §§ 163-165, 26 July 2005, and Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, §§ 137-149, ECHR 2007-I). Second, by dealing with such a serious issue summarily and by placing on the first applicant, without any explanation, the burden of proving negative facts, such as the lack of State guarantees in Afghanistan, the court practically deprived Mr M. of a meaningful examination of his claim under Article 3. The Court reiterates in this connection that in view of the importance which it attaches to Article 3 of the Convention and the irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of ill-treatment materialises, the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 imperatively requires independent and rigorous scrutiny by a national authority of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 293, 21 January 2011, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "128. Finally, the Court notes with concern that yet another aspect of the requirements of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 was not complied with by the Bulgarian authorities. It observes that under Bulgarian law, whenever the executive chooses to mention national security as the grounds for a deportation order, appeals against such an order have no suspensive effect, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill-treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 16 and 50 above). Moreover, at least until September 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court held that under Bulgarian law there was no possibility of staying the enforcement of a deportation order issued on national security grounds (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In the present case, it appears that the first applicant’s request for a stay of his deportation pending the judicial review proceedings was left practically unexamined (see paragraph 29 above). Before the Court’s decision to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Mr M. could have been deported to Afghanistan at any moment and without a prior independent examination of his claim that such deportation would expose him to a serious risk to his life or physical integrity. While this did not happen (apparently, partly for reasons beyond the Bulgarian authorities’ control and partly because of delays in their actions (see paragraphs 69-75 above)), the issue to be examined is whether or not the available domestic remedies met the requirement of effectiveness under Article 13 and the Court’s case-law. Those requirements take the form of a guarantee and cannot be deemed to have been satisfied by a de facto arrangement (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, § 66)."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court reiterates that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy may prevent the execution of measures that are contrary to the Convention and whose effects are potentially irreversible. Consequently, it is inconsistent with Article 13 for such measures to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 79, ECHR 2002-I, and Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 153). In the context of deportation, the domestic remedy for examination of allegations about serious risks of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country must have automatic suspensive effect (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, §§ 58 and 66, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], cited above, § 293). As the prohibition provided by Article 3 against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is of an absolute character, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 138, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...). By choosing to rely on national security in a deportation order the authorities cannot do away with effective remedies (see Al-Nashif, cited above, § 137)."

It finds that the Bulgarian law and practice in relation to stays of enforcement of deportation orders issued on purported national security grounds are incompatible with Article 13 as they do not guarantee automatic suspension of enforcement and do not secure a substantive, rigorous and independent examination of claims under Article 3 of the Convention prior to deportation."

According to a record of the meeting dated 25 February 1995, it was decided to give guardianship and custody of the applicants and their younger sisters to Mr and Mrs M.

As a non-French speaker she had had integration difficulties which she said increased her isolation. Her aunt nevertheless objected to her seeing the school psychologist as suggested by the teaching staff. Nor was the second applicant given any additional help in learning to read French, allegedly because this would have meant paying for her to have school meals. In spite of these difficulties she did well at school. When she got home from school she would have to do her homework then help her sister with the domestic chores."

When she had no bus pass the second applicant had either to walk to school, which was a forty-five minute walk from where she lived, or to take the bus without a ticket.

The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",

As regards “voluntary offer”, the ILO supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including: the form and subject matter of consent; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion; and the possibility of revoking freely-given consent. Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.”",

It is true that in the case of Rantsev v.

However, it considers that, above all, the facts of the present case concern activities related to “forced labour” and “servitude”, legal concepts specifically provided for in the Convention.

As a matter of fact, the fundamental distinguishing feature between servitude and forced or compulsory labour within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention lies in the victim’s feeling that their condition is permanent and that the situation is unlikely to change. It is sufficient that this feeling be based on the above-mentioned objective criteria or brought about or kept alive by those responsible for the situation."

In the present case the first applicant was convinced that her administrative situation in France depended on her living with Mr and Mrs M., and that she could not free herself from their hold without placing herself in an illegal situation. That feeling was strengthened by certain incidents, such as her hospitalisation under the name of one of her cousins (see paragraph 19 above). What is more, the applicant did not attend school (the Court cannot take her refusal to enrol when she was a minor into consideration), and she received no training that might have given her any hope of ever finding paid work outside the home of Mr and Mrs M. With no day off and no leisure activities, there was no possibility for her to meet people outside the house whom she might ask for help. The Court accordingly considers that the first applicant had the feeling that her condition – that of having to do forced or compulsory labour at the home of Mr and Mrs M. – was permanent and could not change, especially as it lasted four years (see, mutatis mutandis, Siliadin, cited above, §§ 126 ‑ 129).

The applicants affirmed that this lacuna in French law had paradoxically been confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Cassation of 13 January 2009 (see paragraph 50 above) which made an evolutive interpretation of Articles 225-13 and 225-14 of the Criminal Code."

Cyprus and Russia judgment of 7 January 2010. In the present case the applicants pointed out that when the social services submitted a report on children in danger to the public prosecutor in 1995, no further action had been taken. Not until a second report in 1999 was a judicial investigation opened. The applicants alleged that their exploitation continued from 1995 to 1999 even though the prosecuting authorities were aware of the situation. They also complained that the judicial investigation opened in 1999 had only concerned the offence under Article 225-14 of the Criminal Code, and that Mr M. had been brought before the courts only thanks to the applicants, the public prosecutor having failed to appeal against the finding of the investigating judge that there were no grounds for prosecution.

There was therefore no requirement under Article 13 of the Convention, or positive obligation under Article 4, that such an appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor should be automatic; that would deprive him of his fundamental role in criminal proceedings. The Government submitted that in the present case the Prosecutor had considered that no error of law made it necessary for him to appeal to the Court of Cassation. In addition, the Government explained that the rule according to which a civil party could appeal on points of law only in respect of his civil interests did not prevent the Court of Cassation from verifying the conformity with the law of the judgment given by the Court of Appeal in the criminal proceedings.

                "105. The Court observes that the right to expeditious proceedings is guaranteed by the German Basic Law and that a violation of this right may be alleged before the Federal Constitutional Court. Where that court finds that proceedings have taken an excessive time, it declares their length unconstitutional and requests the court concerned to expedite or conclude them. Like the Czech Constitutional Court (see Hartman, cited above, §§ 67-68), but unlike other constitutional and supreme courts in Europe (see, for example, Andrášik and Others, Slaviček and Fernández- Molina González and Others, cited above, and Kunz v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 623/02, 21 June 2005), the German Federal Constitutional Court is not empowered to set deadlines for the lower court or to order other measures to speed up the proceedings in issue; nor is it able to award compensation. In the Government ’ s submission, a finding of unconstitutionality, on account of its erga omnes effect and the publicity enjoyed by the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions, is sufficient to ensure that the proceedings are effectively expedited, especially as the Federal Constitutional Court may, where appropriate, give detailed indications as to how the proceedings could be expedited, as evidenced by its decision of 20 July 2000 (see paragraph 66 above). The Court notes that that decision, in which the Federal Constitutional Court did indeed give fairly detailed indications of the means whereby the court of appeal could speed up the proceedings, remains exceptional and cannot therefore be said to be representative. Furthermore, as regards the effect in concreto of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions, the decision in question referred to that court ’ s settled case-law to the effect that it was not its task to order the courts to take specific measures to expedite proceedings, that being a matter for assessment by the court dealing with the case. In other cases the Federal Constitutional Court has given somewhat vague indications, such as its statement that it was assuming that the hearing scheduled by the lower court would take place or its observation that some cases called for priority treatment on account of what was at stake for the parties (see paragraph 67 above). In certain cases, in which the constitutional complaint concerned the refusal of an appellate court to allow a complaint alleging inaction on account of the length of proceedings in the court below, the Federal Constitutional Court has set aside the refusal and remitted the case to the appellate court."

                "106. Accordingly, the only means available for the Federal Constitutional Court to ensure that pending proceedings are expedited is to declare that their length is in breach of the Basic Law and to call upon the court concerned to take the steps necessary for their progress or conclusion. In this connection, it is worth noting that the Federal Constitutional Court itself acknowledges the limited scope of its powers in declaring the length of proceedings to be unconstitutional (see paragraph 66 above). While accepting that the proceedings may well be conducted more quickly where the court in question complies immediately with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s order, the Court notes that the Government have not provided any indication of the potential or actual impact of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions on the processing of cases in which there have been delays. It observes that in a case against Germany currently pending before it, in which such an order had been given by the Federal Constitutional Court, the proceedings complained of ended sixteen months later in the court in question and two years and nine months later in the Court of Appeal (see Grässer, cited above ). In another case dealt with by the Court, in which the Federal Constitutional Court had ordered the proceedings to be expedited while not finding their length to be unconstitutional, the lower court took a further period of more than ten months to complete its examination, and the proceedings as a whole ended two and a half years after the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s order (see Herbolzheimer, cited above, §§ 31 and 38). In that case, concerning proceedings that had lasted nine years and eight months, the Court, moreover, found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, whereas the Federal Constitutional Court had declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, finding that the length of the proceedings (almost nine years by that stage) had not yet reached an intolerable level (see paragraph 67 above)."

Having regard to the above considerations, the Court finds that the Government have not shown that a constitutional complaint is capable of affording redress for the excessive length of pending civil proceedings.

The Court notes that the Government have not advanced any relevant reasons to warrant the conclusion that an appeal to a higher authority, as provided for in section 26(2) of the German Judges Act, would have been capable of expediting the proceedings in the Regional Court. It observes, moreover, that it has found on a number of occasions that such appeals are not an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 in that they do not generally give litigants a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Kuchař and Štis v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 37527/97, 23 May 2000; Horvat v. Croatia, no. 5 1585/99, § 47, ECHR 2001- VIII; and Lukenda, cited above, §§ 61-63).",

            [
                "110. The Court notes that the special remedy of a complaint alleging inaction has no statutory basis in domestic law. Although a considerable number of courts of appeal have accepted it in principle, the admissibility criteria for it are variable and depend on the circumstances of the particular case. The Federal Court of Justice has yet to give a ruling on the admissibility of such a remedy. As regards the consequences where such a complaint has been declared admissible, the Court notes that the Government have merely stated, citing four cases in support of their position, that the appellate court may order the continuation of the proceedings before the lower court, without giving any further details about the content of such orders or their effect on the proceedings in issue. As regards the fact that certain courts of appeal have chosen to give detailed indications of ways of speeding up the proceedings or have themselves given a decision in place of the lower court (see paragraph 72 above ), the Court observes that only four such courts have delivered decisions to that effect, none of them before the application in the present case was lodged in November 1999, whereas the effectiveness of a particular remedy is normally assessed with reference to the date of the application (see, for example, Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, § 47, 22 May 2001; Nogolica v. Croatia (dec.), no. 77784/01, ECHR 2002 - VIII; and Mariën v. Belgium (dec.), no. 46046/99, 24 June 2004). Moreover, the somewhat general nature of the findings reached by the full Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 70 above) tends to suggest, although the decision in question solely concerned the right to be heard by a court, that an unwritten remedy with variable admissibility criteria is likely to be problematic in terms of constitutional law."

In their observations the parties agreed that the Celle Court of Appeal, which would have had jurisdiction had the applicant brought a complaint alleging inaction on account of the length of the proceedings in the Regional Court, has yet to give a ruling on the admissibility of such a complaint. Having regard to the uncertainty about the admissibility criteria for a special complaint alleging inaction and to the practical effect of such a complaint on the proceedings in the instant case, the Court considers that no particular relevance should be attached to the fact that the Celle Court of Appeal has not ruled out this remedy in principle (see paragraph 71 above). It further notes that the Federal Constitutional Court did not declare the applicant ’ s constitutional complaints inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the meaning of the first sentence of section 90(2) of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 62 above)."

                "113. Lastly, as regards the remedy of an action for damages, the Court notes that the Government have cited only one judgment, delivered recently by the Munich I Regional Court, which held that the inaction observed in proceedings in the administrative courts amounted to a breach of judicial duties. However, a single final judicial decision – given, moreover, at first instance – is not sufficient to satisfy the Court that there was an effective remedy available in theory and in practice (see Rezette v. Luxembourg, no. 73983/01, § 27, 13 July 2004; Mariën, cited above; and Gama da Costa v. Portugal, no. 12659/87, Commission decision of 5 March 1990, DR 65, p. 136). Furthermore, the applicant ’ s application to the civil courts for legal aid in order to bring an action for damages was refused on the ground, inter alia, that there had not been any unjustified delays in the proceedings. In any event, even if the relevant courts were to conclude that there had been a breach of judicial duties on account of delays rendering proceedings excessively long, they would not be able to make any award in respect of non-pecuniary damage, whereas, as the Court has previously observed, in cases concerning the length of civil proceedings the applicants above all sustain damage under that head (see Hartman, cited above, § 68, and Lukenda, cited above, § 59; see also Scordino, cited above, § 20 4, and Cocchiarella, cited above, § 9 5 ). The decision of the Munich I Regional Court ( see paragraph 74 above) is a telling example of this shortcoming, since the applicant in that case obtained only partial reimbursement of the legal costs he had necessarily incurred in lodging the complaint alleging inaction."

As regards the effectiveness of these remedies in the aggregate, the Court notes that the Government have neither alleged nor shown that a combination of two or more of them would satisfy the requirements of Article 13. It is therefore unnecessary to rule on this question."

The fact that the Court of Appeal was dependent on the collaboration of an expert in the instant case was not an obstacle to expediting the proceedings. By way of example, when selecting the expert the Court of Appeal should have taken account of the particular need to speed up its examination of the case and, to the extent that it had a choice between several similarly qualified experts, should have attached decisive weight to the time that appeared necessary to draw up the expert report. The court must keep track of the production of the report by setting deadlines.

Doubts thus exist as to whether a special remedy has to be used first or whether a complaint should be lodged immediately with the Federal Constitutional Court. To avoid forfeiting their rights of appeal, litigants often avail themselves of both remedies at the same time. Such constraints provide a clear illustration of the shortcomings of special remedies in terms of the rule of law. At the same time they create an unnecessary burden for citizens and the courts.",
                "The shortcomings referred to above preclude the Federal Constitutional Court from making the admissibility of a constitutional complaint contingent on the use of such special remedies. They are not among the remedies that must be used for the purposes of the first sentence of section 90 ( 2 ) of the Federal Constitutional Court Act.

The Regional Court ’ s persistent inaction did not show that the legislative framework failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 19 § 4 of the Basic Law.

Decisions falling into the latter category include those delivered by the Celle Court of Appeal on 17 March 1975 (no. 7 W 22/75, in which the remedy was found to be admissible only if the court ’ s decision amounted to a denial of justice) and 5 March 1985 ( no. 2 W 16/85, in which the remedy was found to be admissible in respect of an unjustified delay by the lower court in dealing with an application for legal aid). The Federal Court of Justice, for its part, has to date left open the question whether, in exceptional cases and with due regard to constitutional law, a special complaint may be allowed in respect of arbitrary inaction that could be construed as a denial of justice on the part of a lower court (see the decisions of 21 November 199 4 (no.

More recent decisions have clarified the consequences of a complaint alleging inaction. For example, in two decisions of 24 July 2003 (nos. 16 WF 50/03 and 51/03) the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal allowed such a remedy not only where there had been unjustifiable inactivity amounting to a denial of justice, but also where the delay complained of was likely to be prejudicial to a parent claiming parental responsibility, or to the child ’ s well-being. It observed that it could not take the place of the family court, even if this was the most efficient manner of proceeding. Nor could it impose a procedural timetable on the lower court, since unforeseen circumstances might arise. The action it could take was limited to calling on the court to expedite the proceedings as much as possible. However, to give more substance to its order, it set the court deadlines for dealing with an objection to an expert, for giving the expert six weeks in which to produce his report or, otherwise, appointing a new one, for interviewing the parents and child and for arranging a hearing.

Where delays amounted to a breach of a judge ’ s official duties, there could be an entitlement to compensation for the damage sustained. This was so where the judge wrongfully refused to conduct proceedings or delayed them, particularly in the event of a total lack of activity. On account of the principle of judicial independence, the entitlement generally applied only in cases of flagrant abuse ( krasse Missbrauchsfälle ). Compensation could be awarded for non-pecuniary damage where, for example, a person ’ s physical well-being or health had been harmed. It was for the civil courts to rule on the award of compensation, there being no need for a prior finding by the Federal Constitutional Court that the length of the proceedings was unconstitutional. The Government cited a recent decision delivered by the Munich I Regional Court on 12 January 2005 (see paragraph 74 above ) in which the claimant had been refunded the legal costs necessarily incurred in lodging a complaint about the excessive length of proceedings before an administrative court of appeal. They further noted that the proceedings brought by the applicant in the Hanover Regional Court in 2002 had not concerned the State ’ s liability for the excessive length of the proceedings but solely an application for legal aid.",

The binding nature of decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court related only to the application and interpretation of the law and not to the manner in which proceedings should be conducted. The pressure allegedly exerted by publication of a decision finding a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time was insufficient and purely a matter of speculation, and could not in any event seriously be taken into consideration in examining the effectiveness of a constitutional complaint. Such published decisions, moreover, had had no impact on the conduct of the proceedings in the Regional Court in his case. For a remedy to be considered effective, it had to be capable of improving the position of the person concerned, for example, by setting deadlines, as was possible under section 91 of the Austrian Courts Act ( Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz ).

It accordingly could not be regarded as effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. Even supposing that such a remedy was capable of affording redress for the excessive length of proceedings, it should at the very least be available in a consistent manner at national level. However, the Federal Court of Justice, the supreme judicial body responsible for ensuring consistency of case-law at federal level, had accepted it only in the event of a flagrant denial of justice. The applicant inferred from this that such a remedy did not have any prospect of succeeding unless there had been a total lack of activity on the part of the court in question. In his case, however, the Regional Court had taken a whole succession of procedural decisions, which were precisely what had caused the delays. The principle of judicial independence likewise generally constituted an obstacle to the intervention of a higher court in pending proceedings. Furthermore, the three decisions cited by the Government in which courts of appeal had taken over the examination of the case because of the excessive length of the proceedings in the lower court were recent and two of them had concerned family law, a field in which particular diligence and promptness were called for."

His application had been refused at first instance and subsequently by the Celle Court of Appeal on the grounds that there had been no unjustified delays in the proceedings and that he had not provided sufficient details of the damage he had allegedly sustained. The applicant submitted in conclusion that this remedy was ineffective because the courts concerned had taken fourteen months to rule on the matter.

The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 157-58 )."

Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 183 and 186, and Cocchiarella, cited above, §§ 74 and 77)."

The Court observes that the right to expeditious proceedings is guaranteed by the German Basic Law and that a violation of this right may be alleged before the Federal Constitutional Court. Where that court finds that proceedings have taken an excessive time, it declares their length unconstitutional and requests the court concerned to expedite or conclude them. Like the Czech Constitutional Court (see Hartman, cited above, §§ 67-68), but unlike other constitutional and supreme courts in Europe (see, for example, Andrášik and Others, Slaviček and Fernández- Molina González and Others, cited above, and Kunz v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 623/02, 21 June 2005), the German Federal Constitutional Court is not empowered to set deadlines for the lower court or to order other measures to speed up the proceedings in issue; nor is it able to award compensation. In the Government ’ s submission, a finding of unconstitutionality, on account of its erga omnes effect and the publicity enjoyed by the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions, is sufficient to ensure that the proceedings are effectively expedited, especially as the Federal Constitutional Court may, where appropriate, give detailed indications as to how the proceedings could be expedited, as evidenced by its decision of 20 July 2000 (see paragraph 66 above). The Court notes that that decision, in which the Federal Constitutional Court did indeed give fairly detailed indications of the means whereby the court of appeal could speed up the proceedings, remains exceptional and cannot therefore be said to be representative. Furthermore, as regards the effect in concreto of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions, the decision in question referred to that court ’ s settled case-law to the effect that it was not its task to order the courts to take specific measures to expedite proceedings, that being a matter for assessment by the court dealing with the case. In other cases the Federal Constitutional Court has given somewhat vague indications, such as its statement that it was assuming that the hearing scheduled by the lower court would take place or its observation that some cases called for priority treatment on account of what was at stake for the parties (see paragraph 67 above). In certain cases, in which the constitutional complaint concerned the refusal of an appellate court to allow a complaint alleging inaction on account of the length of proceedings in the court below, the Federal Constitutional Court has set aside the refusal and remitted the case to the appellate court."

In this connection, it is worth noting that the Federal Constitutional Court itself acknowledges the limited scope of its powers in declaring the length of proceedings to be unconstitutional (see paragraph 66 above). While accepting that the proceedings may well be conducted more quickly where the court in question complies immediately with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s order, the Court notes that the Government have not provided any indication of the potential or actual impact of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s decisions on the processing of cases in which there have been delays. It observes that in a case against Germany currently pending before it, in which such an order had been given by the Federal Constitutional Court, the proceedings complained of ended sixteen months later in the court in question and two years and nine months later in the Court of Appeal (see Grässer, cited above ). In another case dealt with by the Court, in which the Federal Constitutional Court had ordered the proceedings to be expedited while not finding their length to be unconstitutional, the lower court took a further period of more than ten months to complete its examination, and the proceedings as a whole ended two and a half years after the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s order (see Herbolzheimer, cited above, §§ 31 and 38). In that case, concerning proceedings that had lasted nine years and eight months, the Court, moreover, found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, whereas the Federal Constitutional Court had declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, finding that the length of the proceedings (almost nine years by that stage) had not yet reached an intolerable level (see paragraph 67 above)."

As regards the fact that certain courts of appeal have chosen to give detailed indications of ways of speeding up the proceedings or have themselves given a decision in place of the lower court (see paragraph 72 above ), the Court observes that only four such courts have delivered decisions to that effect, none of them before the application in the present case was lodged in November 1999, whereas the effectiveness of a particular remedy is normally assessed with reference to the date of the application (see, for example, Baumann v.

Lastly, as regards the remedy of an action for damages, the Court notes that the Government have cited only one judgment, delivered recently by the Munich I Regional Court, which held that the inaction observed in proceedings in the administrative courts amounted to a breach of judicial duties.

Furthermore, the applicant ’ s application to the civil courts for legal aid in order to bring an action for damages was refused on the ground, inter alia, that there had not been any unjustified delays in the proceedings. In any event, even if the relevant courts were to conclude that there had been a breach of judicial duties on account of delays rendering proceedings excessively long, they would not be able to make any award in respect of non-pecuniary damage, whereas, as the Court has previously observed, in cases concerning the length of civil proceedings the applicants above all sustain damage under that head (see Hartman, cited above, § 68, and Lukenda, cited above, § 59; see also Scordino, cited above, § 20 4, and Cocchiarella, cited above, § 9 5 ).

It should also be noted that, although representation by counsel was compulsory, the applicant was able to submit a large number of requests personally. In the Government ’ s submission, the Regional Court was required to take them into consideration because, for example, an application for a judge to withdraw can be lodged without the intervention of a lawyer. However, the delays caused by the four applications to that effect cannot in themselves account for the length of the proceedings.

The Court accepts that, in some cases, the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all.

This situation, viewed in the context of the absence of sufficiently established and consistent case-law in cases similar to the applicant's, leads the Court to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining redress in respect of non-pecuniary damage by making use of the remedy in question was not sufficiently certain in practice as required by the Convention case-law."

Their overall duration therefore exceeded two and a half years, notwithstanding the explicit requirement of the Code of Civil Procedure that civil cases be heard within two months from the receipt of a statement of claim (Article 154).

Nevertheless, it stated explicitly that the term “administration of justice” did not cover the judicial proceedings in their entirety but extended only to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case. Other judicial acts – mainly of a procedural nature – fell outside the scope of the notion of “administration of justice”. State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act, such as a breach of the reasonable - time requirement in relation to court proceedings, could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction against a judge, if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings. The Constitutional Court emphasised, however, that the constitutional right to compensation from the State for the damage caused should not be bound up with the individual fault of the judge concerned. An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred as a result of the violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.

Germany, 16 September 1996, § 55, Reports 1996 ‑ IV).

In relation to the last criterion the Court has indicated that, with regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine its existence and quantum. The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively long proceedings will occasion non ‑ pecuniary damage. The Court accepts that, in some cases, the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all. In such cases the domestic courts will have to justify their decision by giving sufficient reasons (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 203-204).",

Russia, no. 43726/02, § 19, 27 July 2006 ).

Although the Constitutional Court – as far back as 2001 – called on the legislature to determine the procedural rules governing actions for compensation for violations of the right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention (see paragraph 28 above), the domestic law has not evolved since. This situation, viewed in the context of the absence of sufficiently established and consistent case-law in cases similar to the applicant's, leads the Court to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining redress in respect of non-pecuniary damage by making use of the remedy in question was not sufficiently certain in practice as required by the Convention case-law."

Their overall duration therefore exceeded two and a half years, notwithstanding the explicit requirement of the Code of Civil Procedure that civil cases be heard within two months from the receipt of a statement of claim (Article 154). In the Court's view, such a long period clearly falls foul of the requirement of speediness necessary for a remedy to be “effective” (see, by contrast, Scordino, cited above, § 208)."

It is not apparent from the domestic judgments what period of non-enforcement the courts took into account or what method of calculation they employed in determining that amount (see paragraph 23 above). What is certain, however, is that the award of less than EUR 50 per year of non-enforcement is manifestly unreasonable in the light of the Court's case-law in similar cases against Russia (see the case-law cited in paragraph 65 below, and also compare Scordino, cited above, § 214)."

As regards the period following the Court's judgment of 18 November 2004, which is at issue in the present application, the Court observes that a major part of the judgment debt was not paid until October 2006, that is, almost two years later. The Government did not explain why the alleged defects in the enforcement papers had not been uncovered by the Ministry of Finance back in 2004 when it had authorised the payment. In any event, the responsibility for the delays lies with the authorities because the alleged defects were contained in official documents issued by a Russian court. Even after the typing errors had been corrected, it took the Ministry of Finance one year to effect the payment. Finally, the Court observes that the full amount of the judgment debt has not yet been paid to the applicant, despite the fact that the supplementary judgment of 15 February 2001 provided for payment of the entire amount to the applicant's account in Israel (see paragraph 8 above). This was due to the fact that the Ministry of Finance did not make provision for covering the commission of the State ‑ owned bank through which it carried out the wire transfer. As a result, the applicant, through no fault of his own, received a lesser amount than the one awarded to him in the judgment of 30 July 1999, as amended on 15 February 2001."

            [
                "97. Naturally, the Court cannot overlook that in its recent case ‑ law the Supreme Court of Cassation, when it allows claims for compensation brought under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act by persons who have been acquitted or the proceedings against whom have been discontinued, in fixing the amount of damages takes into account, among other factors, the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court does not consider that such claims can be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the excessive length of criminal proceedings, for several reasons. First, the cause of action underlying such claims is not a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, but the fact that the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal or have been discontinued (see paragraph 48 above and contrast Gonzalez Marín v. Spain (dec.) no. 39521/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII; Mifsud, cited above; and Paulino Tomás v. Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII). Therefore, it cannot be regarded as an avenue whereby persons charged with criminal offences can vindicate, as such, their right to a hearing within a reasonable time (see Ommer v. Germany (no. 1), no. 10597/03, §§ 41 ‑ 43 and 75, 13 November 2008, and Ommer v. Germany (no. 2), no. 26073/03, §§ 37 ‑ 40 and 62, 13 November 2008, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Peev v. Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, §§ 72 ‑ 73, 26 July 2007). Secondly – and this point is closely related with the first – it is unclear what weight the domestic courts, when calculating the amount of damages to be awarded to a successful claimant, accord to the length of the proceedings vis ‑ à ‑ vis other relevant factors, such as the length of any related pre ‑ trial detention or the impact of the proceedings on the individual ’ s private or family life (see paragraph 48 above). It is thus impossible to ascertain whether the level of compensation afforded to the applicant in relation to the length of the proceedings is reasonable (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 206, and Simaldone v. Italy, no. 22644/03, § 30, 31 March 2009). Thirdly, those claims do not fall to be examined under a streamlined procedure, but under the general rules of civil procedure, by at least two, and possibly three, levels of court, with the result that the proceedings can last several years (see paragraph 49 in fine above). Such a lapse of time is not reconcilable with the requirement that a remedy for delay be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane, cited above, § 123). Fourthly, such claims can be brought only after the criminal proceedings have ended and not while they are still pending (see Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, §§ 52 ‑ 53, 21 July 2009). Lastly, such claims may come for hearing before the courts against which they are directed, and any awards that the courts make pursuant to such claims must be paid out of their budget. Both of those facts may raise serious issues in relation to the lack of objective impartiality of the courts hearing such claims (see Mihalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 67719/01, §§ 45 ‑ 51, 10 April 2008). Therefore, claims under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, but any awards made in such proceedings may be relevant in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, § 37 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ II, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 47, ECHR 1999 ‑ II)."

Statutory limitations on the duration of the two parts of the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings – ‘ investigation ’ and ‘ steps to be taken by the prosecutor after the investigation has been completed ’ – still exist and continue to be applied. ...",
                "The repealed ... Articles 368 and 369 of the Code contained the implicit assessment of the legislature that, in view of the need to complete criminal proceedings within a reasonable time, it was unacceptable for a person to remain charged in pre ‑ trial proceedings for more than two years in cases of serious offences and for more than one year in cases of lesser offences. In most cases those time ‑ limits would be longer than the sum of the time ‑ limits under Article 234 §§ 1 ‑ 5 and Article 242 § 3 of the Code. An exception could occur only if the duration of the investigation was extended, exceptionally, to more than six months by the head of a regional or higher prosecutor ’ s office or a person designated by him or her (Article 234 § 3 of the Code). Only then would the repeal lead to a restriction of a procedural right and raise the question whether, in the light of Article 31 § 4 of the Constitution and Article 18 of the Convention, that restriction did not exceed what was required for the administration of justice.",
                "The Constitutional Court does not accept the argument that the legislative change destroys the right of the accused to have their cases examined within a ‘ reasonable time ’, as required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure laid down the basic principle that cases are to be examined and decided within a reasonable time, requiring the authorities in charge of pre ‑ trial investigations to comply with procedural time ‑ limits (Article 22 of the Code). The constitutional amendments in 2006 and the new [Judiciary Act], adopted in 2007, put in place additional safeguards for the faster examination of cases and for avoiding their undue protraction. The repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not affect that system of rules. Its aim was to improve the law in order to ensure good justice, which is [a legitimate aim].",
                "The main weakness of the repealed procedure was that it used a formal, purely quantitative criterion to measure ‘ reasonable time ’ during the pre ‑ trial phase of the proceedings. It is true that in most cases such an approach would lead to a correct assessment – something fully logical in view of the fact that under the rules of procedure a person can be charged only if there already exists ‘ enough evidence ’ that he or she is guilty. However, in some complex cases that criterion might, contrary to the public interest that all offenders be brought to justice, give the accused an undue advantage – for instance in cases in which it proves to be genuinely difficult to trace and charge accomplices, cases in which the need arises to gather additional evidence, including through letters rogatory, cases in which the accused has slowed down the proceedings, etc. It is no wonder that the case ‑ law of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is quite flexible. That Court uses three criteria to assess the relevant period : the factual and legal complexity of the case, the conduct of any authorities involved and the conduct of the person concerned [(see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51; Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66; Kreps v. Poland, no. 34097/96, 26 July 2001; and S.H.K. v. Bulgaria, no. 37355/97, 23 October 2003 )]. It is equally possible to exceed a reasonable time while formally complying with the applicable time ‑ limits and to comply with the ‘ reasonable time ’ requirement while exceeding the applicable time ‑ limits. The European Court of Human Rights finds breaches of the ‘ reasonable time ’ requirement only on the basis of delays attributable to the authorities. In view of that, the Constitutional Court considers that by repealing [Articles 368 and 369] of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure the legislature sought to achieve a constitutionally legitimate aim – to ensure the interests of justice while taking into account the right to ‘ a hearing within a reasonable time ’, as construed by the European Court of Human Rights. In so far as in exceptional cases the new legal framework could restrict the rights of the accused, one should take into account that there exists a balancing mechanism, namely the requirement under Article 234 §§ 8 and 9 of the [Code] for all preventive measures [such as pre ‑ trial detention or house arrest] to be set aside after the expiry of time ‑ limits that are identical to those under the repealed provisions.",
                "It is also important to examine whether the repeal of the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial does not create a lacuna in the law, in breach of the requirement of Article 13 of the Convention for effective remedies in respect of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention and in particular the right of those charged with criminal offences to have their cases examined within a reasonable time. In its case ‑ law the European Court of Human Rights has held that remedies are effective if they can prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred [(see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 158, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI )]. In a number of judgments, that Court has noted that before the introduction of Article 239a of the [1974] Code of Criminal Procedure our State did not make available a remedy complying with the requirements of Article 13, read in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and capable of ensuring that the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings does not exceed a reasonable time [(see Osmanov and Yuseinov v. Bulgaria, nos. 54178/00 and 59901/00, 23 September 2004; Mitev v. Bulgaria, no. 40063/98, 22 December 2004; and Sidjimov v. Bulgaria, no. 55057/00, 27 January 2005 )]. In those circumstances, the answer to the above question depends on whether, from the creation of that remedy in 2003 until its abolition in 2010, the State has created alternative mechanisms ensuring the availability of effective remedies in respect of the right to have charges examined within a reasonable time during the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings. In [our] view, that has been done, as far as rules are concerned. An amendment to the Constitution [which came into force in February 2007] created a new independent body, the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, which may act pursuant to requests by the persons concerned, a category which includes those charged with a criminal offence. That Inspectorate checks the work of the judicial authorities and has the power to report and make proposals to all State authorities, including the competent judicial authorities (Article 132a §§ 6 and 9 of the Constitution). The Inspectorate ’ s powers have been laid down in more detail in the new [Judiciary Act]. It may now check ‘ the way in which judicial, prosecutorial and investigation case files are being opened and processed, as well as their completion within the prescribed time ‑ limits ’ (section 54(1)(2) of the Act). Under section 58(3) of the Act, the results of such checks have to be made available not only to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned, but also to the head of the relevant department of the judiciary. That head must then inform the chief inspector whether any recommendations given have been complied with within the time ‑ limit set in the Inspectorate ’ s report (section 58(4) of the Act). If it is necessary to prevent or overcome an undue delay during the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings, the authority in charge of ensuring compliance with the Inspectorate ’ s directions is the head of the relevant department of the prosecuting authorities. He or she has the power to take various measures: organisational (under section 136(4) of the Act), disciplinary (to impose certain light sanctions under section 311(1) of the Act or to initiate disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council) and procedural (to set aside or vary the decisions of the lower prosecutors, to give mandatory directions or personally to take the necessary procedural steps, as possible under Article 46 § 3 of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure, [or] to exercise control over the activities of the investigating authorities in line with Articles 196 and 197 of the [same Code]). It can therefore be accepted that the repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not lead to a legal vacuum incompatible with Article 13 of the Convention. Naturally, the mere existence of rules does not preclude the risk of future judgments in which the European Court of Human Rights will find violations in respect of Bulgaria. All State authorities must take into account the general statement made in Kudła, cited above, namely that the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law .”",

For example, it prescribes short time-limits for the examination of a case and for postponement of its examination (Articles 252, 271 and 345) and the more widespread use of simplified procedures (Articles 356 ‑ 361, 362 ‑ 367 and 370 ‑ 374). According to the 2009 report of the president of the Supreme Court of Cassation on the work of the courts, the simplified judicial procedures most often used in 2009 in the field of criminal justice related to summary judicial investigation and plea bargaining between the accused and the prosecution (an agreement enabling the prosecution to be terminated provided the court approves).",

This inspectorate organises thematic controls in accordance with a programme approved by the Ministry of Justice. It may make recommendations and supervises their implementation in the course of subsequent inspections.",

The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ( [section] 311).",
                "The authorities have stated that during the period 2007 ‑ 2009 the number of disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council rose steadily (13 in 2007, 28 in 2008 and 83 in 2009). By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year.",
                "The Bulgarian authorities have adopted several strategies on judicial reforms. For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 2010 ‑ 2014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above).",

However, it should be noted that in another case examined by the European Court ( Shishkovi against Bulgaria, No. 17322/04, 25 March 2010), the application of Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP was the cause of the closure of a criminal inquiry into ill ‑ treatment.

This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities.",

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 180, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ). The Court does not doubt that the plea bargain between Mr Dimitrov and the prosecution (see paragraph 15 above) prevented further delay in the determination of the criminal charges against him. It also probably led to a more lenient punishment than the one that he might have received if his case had gone to trial. It is a common feature of European criminal justice systems for a criminal defendant to receive a reduction in his or her sentence for a guilty plea in advance of trial (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, § 168, 6 July 2010, with further references).

Taking into account all aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court had imposed a sentence below the mean envisaged in respect of the chief offence of which Mr Hamanov had been convicted. That approach had been representative of a steady practice of the Bulgarian courts in recent years. In the Government ’ s view, this case could be distinguished from the cases of Mladenov v.

As evident from its reasoning, that court took the length of the proceedings into account amongst a number of other mitigating circumstances (see paragraph 26 above). While it is true that Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence was below the mean punishment envisaged by the 1968 Criminal Code for the chief offence of which he was convicted (see paragraph 51 above), it is not clear from the court ’ s reasoning whether the time/delay element amounted to a primary ground to mitigate the sentence. The Court cannot therefore find that the reduction on account of the length factor was measurable and had a decisive impact on Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence. He cannot therefore be regarded as having been afforded quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time ( see Jensen v.

Moreover, the question whether the alleged redress was sufficient to make good a violation resulting from the entire length of the proceedings can be decided only at their close. The reduction of Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence by the first ‑ instance court could not remedy any delays that occurred later, when the case was heard on appeal (see Uoti v.

The Court observes that, at least between 1995 and 2002, the criminal proceedings against Mr Dimitrov apparently did not have a significant impact on him : there is no indication that he suffered any practical consequences or damage as a result of the fact that there were outstanding criminal charges against him. It does not appear that he risked a serious sentence either. However, it cannot be overlooked that the case was very simple, that Mr Dimitrov ’ s conduct was not the source of any delays, and the authorities were responsible – directly or indirectly – for all the delays. Between November 1995 and February 2002 the case remained dormant for no apparent reason (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 above). The period of inactivity between May 2002 and March 2005, while at first sight due to an objective reason – a key witness and possible co ‑ accused being abroad – cannot be considered justified, given that that individual could have been interviewed during the five years between the opening of the proceedings in 1995 and the time when he left Bulgaria in 2000 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). Lastly, almost ten months passed between the submission of the indictment and the first trial hearing, at which the court approved the plea bargain between Mr Dimitrov and the prosecution (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). The Government have not put forward any explanation for that gap."

                "79. This is a second application by Mr Hamanov. His first one concerned, among other things, the length of the criminal proceedings against him. It resulted in a judgment in which the Court found, among other things, a breach of Mr Hamanov ’ s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Court ’ s conclusion was based on the length of the proceedings from when they started in March 1996 until the latest information from the parties in April 2003 (see Hamanov, cited above, §§ 11 ‑ 32 and 102 ‑ 07 ). While as a rule, when assessing whether proceedings are reasonable in length, the Court looks at their actual duration up to the adoption of its judgment (see Pailot v. France, 22 April 1998, § 57, Reports 1998 ‑ II; S.A.GE.MA S.N.C. v. Italy, no. 40184/98, § 11, 27 April 2000; Rotondi v. Italy, no. 38113/97, § 13, 27 April 2000; S.A. v.

Portugal, no. 61009/00, § 32, 4 November 2004 ), in that case it did not consider the period between May 2003, the date of the latest information from the parties, and 18 March 2004, the date of the adoption of its judgment (see Hamanov, cited above, §§ 102 ‑ 03 ). The period to be considered in the present case thus started in April 2003 (see paragraph 16 above). The proceedings ended on 9 July 2008 (see paragraph 32 above).

France, 22 April 1998, § 66, Reports 1998 ‑ II; Leterme v. France, 29 April 1998, § 70, Reports 1998 ‑ III; Henra v. France, 29 April 1998, § 70, Reports 1998 ‑ II; Ada Maccari v.

There were no serious delays in the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 29 ‑ 32 above). However, the same cannot be said of the proceedings before the Plovdiv Regional Court and the Plovdiv Court of Appeal. The Plovdiv Regional Court held eleven hearings. One of those was adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities, four for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov ’ s co ‑ accused, two for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov, and two because of the need to gather additional evidence, with the result that the case remained pending before that court for more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 18 ‑ 25 above). After that, there was a gap of about fourteen months between the filing of the appeals against the Plovdiv Regional Court ’ s judgment and the time when the Plovdiv Court of Appeal heard those appeals (see paragraph 28 above). Part of that delay was apparently due to the late handing down of the reasons for the Plovdiv Regional Court ’ s judgment (see paragraph 26 in limine above). The Court considers that the authorities could have done more to expedite the examination of the case, which had started as early as March 1996 and had already been beset by considerable delays (see Hamanov, cited above, § 105 )."

A comprehensive restatement of the relevant principles, as established in Kudła and its progeny, may be found in the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Sürmeli v. Germany ( [GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references ) :",
                "(a) Under Article 1 of the Convention, which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (on that point, see also Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII );",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (on that point, see also Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 186 );",
                "(e) Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing a claim against the State, such a claim must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, and its sufficiency may be affected by excessive delays and depend on the level of compensation.",

The Court has therefore in a number of cases rejected the Government ’ s argument, noting that they were unable to cite any domestic case ‑ law in support of their assertion (see Nalbantova, cited above, §§ 25 and 35; Doinov v.

            ],
            [
                "97. Naturally, the Court cannot overlook that in its recent case ‑ law the Supreme Court of Cassation, when it allows claims for compensation brought under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act by persons who have been acquitted or the proceedings against whom have been discontinued, in fixing the amount of damages takes into account, among other factors, the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court does not consider that such claims can be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the excessive length of criminal proceedings, for several reasons. First, the cause of action underlying such claims is not a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, but the fact that the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal or have been discontinued (see paragraph 48 above and contrast Gonzalez Marín v. Spain (dec.) no. 39521/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII; Mifsud, cited above; and Paulino Tomás v. Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII). Therefore, it cannot be regarded as an avenue whereby persons charged with criminal offences can vindicate, as such, their right to a hearing within a reasonable time (see Ommer v. Germany (no. 1), no. 10597/03, §§ 41 ‑ 43 and 75, 13 November 2008, and Ommer v. Germany (no. 2), no. 26073/03, §§ 37 ‑ 40 and 62, 13 November 2008, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Peev v. Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, §§ 72 ‑ 73, 26 July 2007). Secondly – and this point is closely related with the first – it is unclear what weight the domestic courts, when calculating the amount of damages to be awarded to a successful claimant, accord to the length of the proceedings vis ‑ à ‑ vis other relevant factors, such as the length of any related pre ‑ trial detention or the impact of the proceedings on the individual ’ s private or family life (see paragraph 48 above). It is thus impossible to ascertain whether the level of compensation afforded to the applicant in relation to the length of the proceedings is reasonable (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 206, and Simaldone v. Italy, no. 22644/03, § 30, 31 March 2009). Thirdly, those claims do not fall to be examined under a streamlined procedure, but under the general rules of civil procedure, by at least two, and possibly three, levels of court, with the result that the proceedings can last several years (see paragraph 49 in fine above). Such a lapse of time is not reconcilable with the requirement that a remedy for delay be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane, cited above, § 123). Fourthly, such claims can be brought only after the criminal proceedings have ended and not while they are still pending (see Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, §§ 52 ‑ 53, 21 July 2009). Lastly, such claims may come for hearing before the courts against which they are directed, and any awards that the courts make pursuant to such claims must be paid out of their budget. Both of those facts may raise serious issues in relation to the lack of objective impartiality of the courts hearing such claims (see Mihalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 67719/01, §§ 45 ‑ 51, 10 April 2008). Therefore, claims under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, but any awards made in such proceedings may be relevant in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, § 37 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ II, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 47, ECHR 1999 ‑ II)."

Lastly, it should be mentioned – and welcomed – that the 2007 Judiciary Act expressly recognises, in its section 7(1), the right to a “ hearing within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 36 above), and that the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure lays down, in its Article 22, an obligation for the courts to “ examine and decide cases within a reasonable time ”, and for prosecutors and the investigating authorities to ensure that “ pre ‑ trial proceedings are conducted within the time ‑ limits laid down in [the] Code ” (see paragraph 42 above).

It had to be borne in mind that the two applications concerned proceedings which had taken place between 1996 and 2009. The assessment whether they were indicative of a structural problem called for the consideration of the reform of the criminal justice system which had taken place during that period. Many of those reforms, which had started in 1999, had been a result of rulings made by the Court. The increasing incidence of adverse rulings against Bulgaria and the high number of pending applications evinced not only problems with the Bulgarian criminal justice system, but also the increasing popularity of the Court. Another fact showing the lack of a structural problem was that the Committee of Ministers had not adopted an interim resolution in relation to the group of Bulgarian cases concerning length of proceedings.

In 2009, the number of cases resulting in a judicial decision had increased by 19%. In spite of the huge increase in the incoming cases, the number of unfinished cases at the end of 2009 had diminished by 2,500 compared with the previous year."

Further measures taken by the authorities to tackle the problem were reflected in the recent adoption of a “Blueprint” for the Penal Policy of the Republic of Bulgaria for the Period 2010 ‑ 14 (“ Концепция за наказателната политика на Република България за периода 2010 ‑ 2014 г. ”), and a “Blueprint” for Overcoming the Causes for the Adverse Rulings of the Court Against Bulgaria (“ Концепция за преодоляване на причините за осъдителните решения на Европейския съд по правата на човека срещу България и за решаване на проблемите, произтичащи от тях ”), adopted by the Government in March 2009. One of the aims of the former had been a reduction of the formalities in criminal proceedings. The aim of the latter had been the creation of a roadmap for overcoming the problems leading to judgments in which the Court finds that Bulgaria is in breach of its Convention obligations. That Blueprint had been drawn up by a working group comprising senior State officials and prominent human ‑ rights activists. It had specifically addressed the issue of unreasonable length of proceedings and had proposed solutions for overcoming it and for putting in place effective remedies in respect of it. Based on that Blueprint, a working group had been asked to propose amendments to the 1988 Act. In May 2010 that group had drawn up a draft bill, but work on it was still under way. That bill specifically envisaged adding undue delay in criminal, civil and administrative cases as a cause of action entailing State liability."

Despite that, the Bulgarian State had not done enough to tackle the problem. Mr Hamanov ’ s case was a telling example. Legislative reforms had been somewhat chaotic, as evidenced by the changes in policy in that domain from one government to the next. The statistics provided by the Government were incomplete; they did not show whether undue delays had occurred and could not serve as a basis to conclude that the problem had been resolved. It was unclear whether and when the measures envisaged in the two blueprints mentioned by the Government would be implemented. The fact that the draft bill for the amendment of the 1988 Act had not been put before Parliament for more than a year showed the lack of political will to see those measures through. It could not be accepted that the inspectorates of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Judicial Council would provide a solution to the problem. The Government had not pointed to specific examples in which interventions by those bodies had led to an acceleration of the proceedings.

Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 111 ‑ 18, 26 July 2001 ), the Court has found breaches of the reasonable ‑ time requirement in criminal proceedings in more than eighty cases ( see Annex 1 ). Forty ‑ one cases concerning such complaints have resulted in friendly settlements or have been struck out of the Court ’ s list on the basis of unilateral declarations by the Government (see Annex 2). According to the information in the Court ’ s case management database, there are at present approximately two hundred cases against Bulgaria awaiting first examination which contain a complaint concerning the length of criminal proceedings. The above numbers show the existence of a systemic problem (see, among other authorities, Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, §§ 90 ‑ 93, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; and Rumpf, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 70 ). Indeed, as recently as 26 January 2011 the issue was noted “with grave concern” by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which urged Bulgaria to “pursue its efforts to solve the problem of excessive length of court proceedings” (see paragraph 55 above)."

            [
                "112. First, in its recent Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 the Committee of Ministers, having examined the information – including statistics – supplied by the Bulgarian authorities, noted that the legislative reforms introduced between 2006 and 2010 had not yet produced their full impact on the length of proceedings and that a longer period was needed before the effectiveness of the measures taken could be fully assessed (see paragraph 52 above). Since the statistics on which the Government relied before the Court to prove that the problem of the excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria has been resolved are largely identical to those that they provided to the Committee of Ministers, the Court sees no reason to come to a conclusion that differs from that of the Committee. It also considers that it is too early to find that the measures taken by the Bulgarian State to prevent unreasonably lengthy proceedings, while certainly to be encouraged, have produced tangible results. Indeed, the statistics supplied by the Government contain no data about the average duration of criminal proceedings in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 54 and 102 above)."

                "113. Secondly, in view of the nature of the problem, the introduction of measures designed to ensure that the examination of criminal cases will not be unduly delayed in the future cannot remedy the problems engendered by delays accrued before the introduction of such measures."

            [

For those reasons, the Court, while welcoming the Bulgarian State ’ s continued efforts to improve the speed with which criminal cases are dealt with and the Government ’ s willingness to conclude friendly settlements in respect of such complaints, finds that the problem of the excessive length of criminal proceedings in Bulgaria cannot at this stage be regarded as having been fully resolved."
            ],
            [
                "115. It is not the Court ’ s function to express an opinion on the Bulgarian criminal justice system. The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their judicial systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see König v. Germany, 28 June 1978, § 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, §§ 83 and 84, 16 November 2010 ). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both a legal and logistical character. Some of those – such as an insufficient number of judges, prosecutors, investigators or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management – may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others – such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence – may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), §§ 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, § 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 40450/04, §§ 90 ‑ 92, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts) ). Indeed, as evident from its Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 and the first Appendix to it, the Committee is already doing so and will continue, in cooperation with the national authorities (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). By way of example, the Court would point to the recent adoption of statutory provisions proclaiming the right to a “ hearing within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 36 above) and the obligation for the courts to “ examine and decide cases within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 42 above)."

However, there remains the question of the existence – or lack – of effective remedies in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), § 138, and Olaru and Others, § 58, both cited above). In its Interim Resolution the Committee of Ministers gave consideration to the point and found that there existed “certain structural problems in this field” (see paragraph 52 above). Indeed, less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 would undermine the operation of the subsidiary character of the Court in the Convention system and, more generally, weaken the effective functioning, on both the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see McFarlane v.

In some cases, the Bulgarian courts mitigate sentences on the basis of the general provisions of the Criminal Code governing the individualisation of punishment (see paragraph 50 above). However, that practice is often a result of the courts ’ view that long after the commission of an offence the aims of the punishment and the public interest do not require harsh sentences. Thus, while in some cases the courts spell out clearly that the reduction is meant as redress for a breach of the right to trial within a reasonable time, in others, such as Mr Hamanov ’ s, they do not (see paragraphs 26, 65 and 66 above). Since that practice is not based on express statutory language or established case ‑ law, usually does not make clear that the sentence is reduced in an express and measurable manner so as to make good any undue delays, and, most importantly, is not a possibility available as of right to those concerned, it cannot for the time being be regarded as an effective remedy. In addition, it should be pointed out that it is obviously available only if the proceedings result in a conviction (see Ommer (no. 1), cited above, § 71 )."

The only remedy found by the Court to be effective, at least in some limited situations, was the procedure under Article 239a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, introduced in June 2003 (see paragraphs 38 ‑ 40 and 92 above). In April 2006 that procedure was superseded by an almost identical procedure, governed by Articles 368 ‑ 69 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 43 above). That remedy could function either as an acceleratory one ( it could expedite the bringing of a case to trial ) or as a compensatory one ( it could lead to a discontinuance of proceedings ). However, it had certain limitations. When operating as an acceleratory remedy, it could prevent further delay only in the pre ‑ trial proceedings, and was available only to persons who had been formally charged. That is well illustrated by the proceedings in Mr Hamanov ’ s case (see paragraph 17 above). In addition, it does not seem that it could prevent delays resulting from repeated referrals of cases back to the pre ‑ trial stage – a major source of delay in some Bulgarian criminal cases (see Yankov (no. 2), cited above, § 51 ). When functioning as a compensatory remedy, in could not make up for delays accrued before its introduction in June 2003 (see the cases cited in paragraph 93 above). Lastly, as correctly pointed out by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 45 above), that remedy used a formal criterion to measure “ reasonable time ”, which in some cases could, contrary to the public interest that offenders be brought to justice, result in the undue discontinuance of criminal prosecutions. It could also, as pointed out by the Supreme Court of Cassation, come into conflict with the right to a fair trial (see paragraph 41 above)."

However, according to the Court ’ s established case ‑ law, such mechanisms cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because they do not give the individuals concerned a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Gibas v.

However, the introduction of an acceleratory remedy alone would not be sufficient. Indeed, in Scordino (no. 1) ( cited above, § 186 ) the Court observed that “some States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation”. It also stated that it is clear that for countries where length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings – although desirable for the future – may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., § 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see Žunič v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 24342/04, 18 October 2007; Tomažič v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, § 37 in fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak, cited above, § 36 ). In view of what has been said above, Bulgaria can be considered as a country in which length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist. It must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities “ to complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings ” (see paragraph 52 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 53 and 103 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court ’ s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system ( see Kudła, § 155, and Scordino (no. 1), § 188, both cited above )."

In that connection, consideration may be given to subjecting the examination of such claims to special rules that differ from those governing ordinary claims for damages, to avert the risk that, if examined under the general rules of civil procedure, the remedy may not be sufficiently swift (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 200; Vidas v.

In relation to this criterion, it should be noted that the domestic authorities or courts are clearly in a better position than the Court to determine the existence and quantum of pecuniary damage. In relation to non ‑ pecuniary damage, there exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively lengthy proceedings will cause such damage. Although in some cases the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all, the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to justify its decision to award lower or no compensation by giving sufficient reasons, in line with the criteria set out in this Court ’ s case ‑ law;",

As regards length-of-proceedings cases, the Court reiterates that a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 183, ECHR 2006 ‑ V). However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective. The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria are as follows:",
                "– an action for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time;",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable;",
                "– the procedural rules governing an action for compensation must conform to the principle of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention;",
                "– the rules regarding legal costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified;",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Valada Matos das Neves v. Portugal, no. 73798/13, § 73, 29 October 2015, and Brudan v. Romania, no. 75717/14, § 69, 10 April 2018 )."

            [
                "83. On this last criterion, the Court indicated that, with regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine the existence and quantum. The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There is a strong, although rebuttable, presumption in favour of non-pecuniary damage being occasioned by the excessive length of proceedings. However, there may also be situations where no such damage, or only minimal damage, has been ascertained – for instance where an applicant ’ s conduct has entirely or partly caused the procrastination or where the delay has been caused by circumstances independent of the authorities (see Rutkowski and Others v. Poland, nos. 72287/10 and 2 others, § 182, 7 July 2015, and the case ‑ law cited therein )."

            [
                "85. The Court notes that the parties have not argued, and therefore, for the purposes of the present case, the Court has no reason to doubt that constitutional redress proceedings are, in principle, governed by the procedural fairness guarantees provided by Article 6, and that the compensation awards made are, generally, paid promptly."

            [
                "86. Neither have the parties accentuated or defended at length the issue of the costs of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore that it has repeatedly found (in the context of cases relating to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) that compensation awards are reduced or even absorbed by an order for the payment of costs (see, as recent examples, Zammit and Vassallo v. Malta, no. 43675/16, § 42, 28 May 2019, and Portanier, cited above, § 55 ). The same occurred in the present case, where in proceedings where the applicants ’ claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 in connection with the length of proceedings were upheld, the Constitutional Court nevertheless ordered the applicants to pay 3/5 of the costs of the proceedings (see paragraph 25 above). Thus, while it has not been argued that such costs impede access to such a remedy, they, at the very least, often have an impact on the compensation awarded."
            ],
            [
                "87. The Court observes that there existed no limit on the amount of compensation which could be granted to an applicant in such proceedings. The redress to be awarded is based solely on the exercise by the domestic court judges ’ of their discretion as to what might constitute appropriate pecuniary redress in the circumstances of the particular case. The mere fact that an amount of compensation awarded is low, or that no amount is awarded at all, does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court ’ s assessment of the applicant ’ s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, and Śliwiński v. Poland, no. 40063/06, § 36, 5 January 2010 respectively). In the present case the Constitutional Court denied the applicants any compensation whatsoever without giving sufficient reasons ( see paragraph 47 - 48 above). Moreover, the two cases relied on by the applicants and one of the cases put forward by the Government, as well as the applicants ’ own case, suggest that the Maltese Constitutional Court far too often fails to award any compensation at all for such breaches. Even when they do make an award, the cases brought forward by the Government indicate that the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap Bologna, cited above, § 89, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases ). Indeed, the Court observes that in around two thirds of the cases relied on by the Government the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40 % of the amount), or even manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 2 and 5 % of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, or even no compensation at all, as happened in the present case."

            [
                "88. Further, the Court recalls that a remedy which could last for several years through two jurisdictions would not be reconcilable with the requirement that the remedy for delay (even before a constitutional court) be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 123, 10 September 2010, and the case ‑ law cited therein ). In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that the parties have not elaborated on this matter. However, the fact that the constitutional redress proceedings in the present case lasted nearly six years over two jurisdictions raises doubts about the speediness of the remedial action itself."

Malta (no. 55747/16, 27 August 2019), in the present case the constitutional jurisdictions and in particular the Constitutional Court did not order the eviction of the tenant. There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 67 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the case ‑ law relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the first ‑ instance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., § 86)."

In Apap Bologna, § 88, the Court, noting that it was not for it to interpret domestic law, also expressed regret at the interpretation given by the constitutional jurisdictions as to their impossibility of awarding a higher future rent. According to the Court, such an order would constitute a measure vis ‑ à ‑ vis an individual applicant, which would provide for an end to the violation without affecting the tenant. The same was reiterated in the more recent Portanier judgment, § 48, which noted that this course of action has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, and where the Court reiterated that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite the less weighty legitimate aim, an adequate future rent in the light of that aim, could nonetheless bring the violation to an end. Moreover, the future rent would have had to be established only until 2028 date when the lease will no longer be protected under Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court did not take that approach."

It ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law provisions to retain title to the property. From the domestic case ‑ law brought to the Court ’ s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become customary, at least since 2016. In Portanier the Court maintained that it still had doubts as to this approach, and reiterated its reservations about the fact that the Constitutional Court, whose role is to bring a violation to an end and to redress the upheld violation, abdicates the responsibility assigned to it by the Constitution of Malta and refers applicants to yet another remedy despite it having the power and authority to grant such redress ( § 51). In that case, while having set out a number of considerations, in view of the parties ’ limited submissions and the fact that the applicant had been successful in evicting the tenants, the Court refrained from adjudicating on the effectiveness of that approach in general ( §§ 52 ‑ 54). Similar considerations apply in the present case in relation to the parties ’ limited submissions, and for, inter alia, those same reasons the Court will refrain from adjudicating on the matter in general. The Court will however adjudicate on the effectiveness of such a measure in the present case."

Nor has the Court been informed that the tenants have voluntarily vacated the property since they now (as a result of the Constitutional Court judgment) no longer have title to it (in the absence of the relevant protection of law). It follows that the inaction of both parties has led to the status quo remaining that which existed on the date of the Constitutional Court judgment, more than three years ago. In this connection the Court makes reference to its case ‑ law to the effect that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction ( Musci v. Italy [GC], no. 64699/01, § 90 ECHR 2006 ‑ V (extracts)).

However, leaving that matter open, the Court notes that, unlike the situation in other similar cases against Malta where the interferences had been justified by the legitimate aim of providing social housing, in the present case the interference applied in favour of a commercial entity, namely a bank. Moreover, as the law stood at the time of the Constitutional Court proceedings, the bank would in any event lose the protection of the law and therefore would have to vacate the property when the lease comes to an end in 2028. It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, there seems to be no particular justification for delaying redress and continuing to perpetrate the violation established. Thus, in the absence of an award covering future rent until 2028, the Court considers that the only remedy capable of giving adequate and speedy redress to the applicants in the situation of the present case was for the Constitutional Court to order eviction – a course of action it failed to undertake, as is its normal practice (see paragraph 71 above)."

Such pecuniary awards are also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non-pecuniary damage and/or an order for the payment of the relevant costs (ibid. § 90 and Grech and Others, cited above, § 62).

As regards length-of-proceedings cases, the Court reiterates that a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 183, ECHR 2006 ‑ V). However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective. The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria are as follows:",
                "– an action for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time;",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable;",

                "– the rules regarding legal costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified;",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Valada Matos das Neves v. Portugal, no. 73798/13, § 73, 29 October 2015, and Brudan v. Romania, no. 75717/14, § 69, 10 April 2018 )."

                "83. On this last criterion, the Court indicated that, with regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine the existence and quantum. The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There is a strong, although rebuttable, presumption in favour of non-pecuniary damage being occasioned by the excessive length of proceedings. However, there may also be situations where no such damage, or only minimal damage, has been ascertained – for instance where an applicant ’ s conduct has entirely or partly caused the procrastination or where the delay has been caused by circumstances independent of the authorities (see Rutkowski and Others v. Poland, nos. 72287/10 and 2 others, § 182, 7 July 2015, and the case ‑ law cited therein )."

Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore that it has repeatedly found (in the context of cases relating to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) that compensation awards are reduced or even absorbed by an order for the payment of costs (see, as recent examples, Zammit and Vassallo v. Malta, no. 43675/16, § 42, 28 May 2019, and Portanier, cited above, § 55 ). The same occurred in the present case, where in proceedings where the applicants ’ claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 in connection with the length of proceedings were upheld, the Constitutional Court nevertheless ordered the applicants to pay 3/5 of the costs of the proceedings (see paragraph 25 above). Thus, while it has not been argued that such costs impede access to such a remedy, they, at the very least, often have an impact on the compensation awarded."

            [
                "87. The Court observes that there existed no limit on the amount of compensation which could be granted to an applicant in such proceedings. The redress to be awarded is based solely on the exercise by the domestic court judges ’ of their discretion as to what might constitute appropriate pecuniary redress in the circumstances of the particular case. The mere fact that an amount of compensation awarded is low, or that no amount is awarded at all, does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court ’ s assessment of the applicant ’ s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, and Śliwiński v. Poland, no. 40063/06, § 36, 5 January 2010 respectively). In the present case the Constitutional Court denied the applicants any compensation whatsoever without giving sufficient reasons ( see paragraph 47 - 48 above). Moreover, the two cases relied on by the applicants and one of the cases put forward by the Government, as well as the applicants ’ own case, suggest that the Maltese Constitutional Court far too often fails to award any compensation at all for such breaches. Even when they do make an award, the cases brought forward by the Government indicate that the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap Bologna, cited above, § 89, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases ). Indeed, the Court observes that in around two thirds of the cases relied on by the Government the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40 % of the amount), or even manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 2 and 5 % of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, or even no compensation at all, as happened in the present case."

Further, the Court recalls that a remedy which could last for several years through two jurisdictions would not be reconcilable with the requirement that the remedy for delay (even before a constitutional court) be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 123, 10 September 2010, and the case ‑ law cited therein ). In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that the parties have not elaborated on this matter.

Thus, in assessing the pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants, the Court has, as far as appropriate, considered the estimates provided and had regard to the information available to it on rental values on the Maltese property market during the relevant period. It has also considered the legitimate purpose of the restriction suffered, bearing in mind that legitimate objectives in the “public interest”, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see, inter alia, Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, § 18 and 20, 17 July 2008). In the present case however, the Court keeps in mind that the property was not used for securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (compare, Fleri Soler and Camilleri v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 35349/05, § 18, 17 July 2008). Thus, the situation in the present case might be said to involve a degree of public interest which is significantly less marked than in other cases and which does not justify such a substantial reduction compared with the free market rental value (see, Zammit and Attard, cited above, § 75)."

As noted above in the context of assemblies, or other activities that take place on the border of public and private, either physically or conceptually, it is important to bear in mind that private security providers have a very different mandate and set of priorities to the police. As such, the police should be called in whenever uncertainties exist with regard to private and public interests, especially concerning the use of force in such contexts.",

States must impose on private security providers and their personnel a duty of precaution concerning recruitment, training, equipment, planning, command and control, and reporting.

The use of means of physical coercion was neither envisaged nor implied in the loggers ’ duties, so any fight or altercation with third parties could not entail their employer ’ s liability. Domestic law provided for criminal liability for abuse of authority or office or for exceeding official powers. To be held liable for those offences, a person ’ s actions needed to relate to his or her official position or result from action taken in connection with his or her official powers but in excess of their scope or result from an intention to abuse an official power. Where this was not the case, different provisions of the law penalising offences committed by private individuals were applicable.

This is further illustrated by the fact that the company and its staff had been engaged to guard the construction site by a private entity, the Main Contractor, under a private-law contract (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above).

In that case the Court examined and rejected the Government ’ s arguments as to the lack of responsibility on the part of the respondent Government for the acts of that employee due to the fact that, in injuring the applicant, he had acted ultra vires and had been convicted for an offence committed in his private capacity rather than of official misconduct.

Moreover, the domestic authorities ’ assessment that it was the third applicant who had intentionally exposed himself to danger was consistent with the conduct of the protesters shown on videos of other incidents that had occurred in Gorky Park submitted by the applicants themselves: their tactic apparently consisted in interposing themselves between the workers with chainsaws and other tree ‑ felling equipment and the trees (see the evidence of events of 24, 25 and 27 May at paragraphs 34, 35 and 38 above).

In such circumstances the Court, having concluded that the relevant law lacked the requisite foreseeability, found that there was no need to verify whether the other two requirements of Article 11 § 2 had been complied with (see Vyerentsov, § 54-56, and Shmushkovych, § 41, both cited above)."

Ukraine ( no. 44529/09, § § 12 and 44, 6 March 2018) the Court was confronted with a situation where the demonstration organised by the applicant had been dispersed on the basis of an order from the domestic court, which had found that the demonstrators had breached particular requirements of substantive law and had encroached upon important legally protected rights and interests of others. They had unlawfully erected structures on the pavement, obstructed the passage of pedestrians, and offended and endangered road users. In that case, unlike in Vyerentsov and Shmushkovych, Article 185–1 of the Code of Administrative Offences was not applied. While criticising the shortcomings of the judicial procedure which had led to the dispersal of the applicant ’ s assembly, the Court nevertheless held that the imposition of restrictions on gatherings at which participants breached substantive law was not, as such, unforeseeable (see Chumak, cited above, § 44). In view of the shortcomings in the judicial procedure, which consisted, in particular, in the fact that the courts had taken the authorities ’ allegations of inappropriate conduct on the part of the protesters at face value and issued an overly broad order banning the applicant ’ s assembly, the Court expressed doubt as to whether the interference in that case met the lawfulness requirement. Nevertheless, it proceeded to examine whether the dispersal in that case met the other requirements of Article 11 § 2 ( ibid., § 48)."

Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 149, ECHR 2018 ). There is no evidence that the applicants raised this argument before the domestic courts or that those courts examined this matter.

Nevertheless, the Court has to address the applicants ’ argument, as it is central to their case, and notes that the constitutional provision on which it is based appears to provide for a regulatory scheme under which the procedure of judicial restrictions of assemblies is linked with a procedure for their advance notification (see paragraph 93 above), which allows the authorities to apply to a court with a request to impose certain restrictions on the planned assembly. This follows from a decision of the Constitutional Court, which provides the authoritative interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision (see paragraph 94 above). It is well illustrated by the provision in the Code of Administrative Justice, which requires the court to reject an action for a judicial order restricting an assembly if it has been lodged belatedly, that is on the planned date of the event or thereafter (see paragraph 100 above). This latter provision was subject to the Court ’ s examination in Chumak, where the Court, for precisely that reason, expressed a doubt as to whether the judicial procedure in question could properly be used to disband an ongoing assembly (cited above, § 42)."

By the time the applicants were arrested, substantial public attention had already been attracted to the problem (compare Cisse v.

There are reasons to doubt that the order, when repeated by the police, was immediately audible and clear to all protesters (see, for example, at paragraph 63 above the findings of the domestic court in the case of the eighth and tenth applicants who had been arrested at the same time as the first to sixth applicants and the proceedings against whom were discontinued). In any event, that repetition came only when the protesters were already restricted in their movement.

After all, the situation on 28 May 2010 has to be seen not in isolation but in the broader context of the events: by that date, it was public knowledge that a construction project was unfolding in the area where the applicants were present and the applicants, who by their own admission, participated in the protests from 20 May 2010, could not but have been aware that the police were likely to be deployed to stop them from interfering in the tree-felling and construction work (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above regarding the evidence concerning the events of 20 and 25 May, for example, and compare Pentikäinen v.

This allegation was made by the MG director to the prosecutor ’ s office (see paragraph 75 above) and was never denied or disproven at the domestic level.

The Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case those failings also have consequences for the respondent State ’ s compliance with its Article 11 obligations. The authorities ’ failure to take any demonstrable steps to investigate that alleged infiltration of the scene of protests by such unidentified and unauthorised persons form part of the respondent State ’ s failure to take reasonable steps to ensure the peaceful nature of the protests (see, mutatis mutandis, Identoba and Others v.

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion.

As regards the Government's reliance on an individual constitutional complaint, the Court first notes that in the context of Polish administrative procedure, two-tiered judicial review of second ‑ instance administrative decisions is available. Only a judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court is considered to constitute a final decision in connection with which a constitutional complaint is available. In the present case, the applicants, having obtained decisions of the second-instance administrative bodies essentially in their favour, in that they quashed the decisions refusing to allow their demonstrations, had no legal interest in bringing an appeal against these decisions to the administrative courts. Hence, the way to the Constitutional Court was not open to them."

Further, the Court accepts that the administrative authorities ultimately acknowledged that the first ‑ instance decisions given in the applicants'case had been given in breach of the applicable laws. However, the Court emphasises that they did so after the dates on which the applicants planned to hold the demonstrations. The Court notes that the present case is similar to that of Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria (nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, Commission decision of 29 June 1998, unreported), in which the former Commission held that “it [ was ] undisputed that had the applicants attempted [an appeal against the refusal of the district court to examine the appeal against the mayoral ban], the proceedings would have lasted for at least several months and any favourable outcome would have resulted long after the date of a planned meeting or manifestation”. In other words, bearing in mind that the timing of the rallies was crucial for their organisers and participants and that the organisers had given timely notice to the competent authorities, the Court considers that, in the circumstances, the notion of an effective remedy implied the possibility to obtain a ruling before the time of the planned events."

In this connection, the Court is of the view that such is the nature of democratic debate that the timing of public meetings held in order to voice certain opinions may be crucial for the political and social weight of such meetings. Hence, the State authorities may, in certain circumstances, refuse permission to hold a demonstration if such a refusal is compatible with the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention, but they cannot change the date on which the organisers plan to hold it. If a public assembly is organised after a given social issue loses its relevance or importance in a current social or political debate, the impact of the meeting may be seriously diminished. Freedom of assembly – if prevented from being exercised at a propitious time – can well be rendered meaningless."

The Court is therefore of the view that it is important for the effective enjoyment of freedom of assembly that the applicable laws provide for reasonable time-limits within which the State authorities, when giving relevant decisions, should act. The applicable laws provided for time ‑ limits for the applicants to submit their requests for permission. In contrast, the authorities were not obliged by any legally binding time ‑ frame to give their final decisions before the planned date of the demonstration. The Court is therefore not persuaded that the remedies available to the applicants in the present case, all of them being of a post ‑ hoc character, could provide adequate redress in respect of the alleged violations of the Convention."

However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36, and Daktaras v.

It is also true that the applicant could, as he did, challenge the initial refusal before the penitentiary court ( see paragraph 23 above ). However, the procedure lasted for nearly five months and no ruling on his appeal had yet been given until the prison authorities eventually changed their original decision and the appeal had become purposeless (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 19 above).

However, subsequently, in the case of Hamer v. the United Kingdom, (no. 7114/75, Commission ’ s report of 13 December 1979) where the Article 12 complaint was based on similar facts, the Commission altered its previous position and expressed an opinion that there was a breach of this provision, holding that “[t]he essence of the right to marry ... is the formation of a legally binding association between a man and a woman.

It was natural that, as the Court had held in many cases concerning the rights of prisoners, any measure depriving a person of liberty inevitably entailed limitations on the exercise of Convention rights, including a measure of control on prisoners ’ contacts with the outside world. In the context of the right to marry it could mean that the authorities, in exercising their power in this area, could monitor the wedding ceremony and limit, for instance, the number of participants. However, they should maintain a fair balance between the demands of security in prison and the prisoner ’ s right to marry. Their discretion should be limited to, and their decisions based on, concrete facts, not on prejudice. A refusal should be restricted to situations where the marriage ceremony would jeopardise the prison security – and not be merely difficult to organise. Moreover, rules regulating the authorities ’ discretion should be laid down in the national law. In particular, the law ought to list specific circumstances in which the authorities should not give leave to marry – for example, if it would affect the process of rehabilitation. In this context, it must be stressed that the issues involved were of a sensitive nature; thus, an unjustified refusal to grant leave to marry could be regarded as additional or disciplinary punishment."

Polish law did not require the civil status authorities to check whether an intended marriage was fictitious or “genuine” before its solemnisation. Since there was no difference in legal status between unmarried persons at liberty and unmarried persons in prison, imposing such a requirement on prisoners was tantamount to discrimination."

Furthermore, Polish legislation gave the authorities deciding on prisoners ’ request for leave to marry an unlimited discretion.

Both as to procedure and substance it is subject to the national laws of the Contracting States, but the limitations thereby introduced must not restrict or reduce the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see F. v. Switzerland, judgment of 18 December 1987, Series A no. 1 28, § 32; and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 29, ECHR 2002-VI).",

This would be tantamount to finding that the range of options open to a Contracting State included an effective bar on any exercise of the right to marry. The margin of appreciation cannot extend so far ( R. and F. v. the United Kingdom, ( dec.) no. 35748/05, 28 November 2006)."

The Convention institutions have accepted that limitations on the right to marry laid down in the national laws may comprise formal rules concerning such matters as publicity and the solemnisation of marriage. They may also include substantive provisions based on generally recognised considerations of public interest, in particular concerning capacity, consent, prohibited degrees of affinity or the prevention of bigamy. In the context of immigration laws and for justified reasons, the States may be entitled to prevent marriages of convenience, entered solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage. However, the relevant laws – which must also meet the standards of accessibility and clarity required by the Convention – may not otherwise deprive a person or a category of persons of full legal capacity of the right to marry with the partners of their choice (see Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Comm. Rep. 13 December 1979, D.R. 24, pp. 12 et seq., §§ 55 et seq.; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Comm. Rep., 10 July 1980, D.R. 24, § 49; Sanders v. France, no. 31401/96, Com.

In contrast to Article 8 of the Convention, which sets forth the right to respect for private and family life, and with which the right “to marry and to found a family” has a close affinity, Article 12 does not include any permissible grounds for an interference by the State that can be imposed under paragraph 2 of Article 8 “in accordance with the law” and as being “necessary in a democratic society”, for such purposes as, for instance, “the protection of health or morals” or “the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. Accordingly, in examining a case under Article 12 the Court would not apply the tests of “necessity” or “pressing social need” which are used in the context of Article 8 but would have to determine whether, regard being had to the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the impugned interference has been arbitrary or disproportionate (see paragraph 4 8 above, with references to the Court ’ s case-law )."

It solely concerned the refusal to grant him leave to marry in prison which, as he alleged, amounted to an arbitrary and disproportionate interference contrary to Article 12. In the Government ’ s view, it did not impair the essence of his right to marry as guaranteed by this provision ( see paragraphs 40-42 above)."

                "55. The Court would observe at the outset that a requirement for a person detained to obtain prior leave in order to have a marriage contracted in prison cannot by itself be regarded as contrary to Article 12 – as stated above, limitations on marital, private and family life are inherent in deprivation of liberty ( see paragraphs 51-52 above ). Also, in deciding whether or not such permission is to be granted, the authorities have a margin of discretion and must have regard not only to the personal interest pursued by the prisoner – however important it may be – but equally to such factors as the maintenance of good order, safety and security in prison. Furthermore, the aims of imprisonment, which are not limited to punitive and deterrent aspects of the penalty but necessarily encompass the rehabilitative elements, are considerations that are relevant in this context (see paragraph 53 above and Dickson cited above, § 75)."

                "56. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the authorities dealing with the applicant ’ s request for leave to marry justified their refusal by reference to grounds which were in no way linked to prison security or prevention of disorder but limited to their assessment of the nature and the quality of his relationship with M.H. First of all, they considered that since the applicant and M.H. could not “substantiate” their acquaintance as being prior to their stay in the same prison, such a relationship had, in their words, been “illegal” or “developed illegally”. This conclusion was based on the fact that the applicant and M.H. had apparently become acquainted with each other when she had been temporarily detained in the same establishment and that they had maintained contact through sending kites – a form of correspondence forbidden in prison ( see paragraphs 12, 15 and 16 above). Second, the authorities held that the circumstances in which the couple ’ s bond had originated – “ in prison ” and “certainly illegally” – meant that it was “very superficial” and “ unworthy ” from the point of view of the applicant ’ s social rehabilitation (see paragraphs 15-16 above)."

Whilst the above arguments clearly reflect the authorities ’ own highly subjective opinion on what kind of relationship should not deserve solemnisation through a marriage, they bear no relation whatsoever to the provisions of the Polish Family and Custody Code governing the exercise of the right to marry and enumerating the grounds on which an authority may refuse an adult person to enter into a marriage. Under Polish law this is for the civil status, not for any other, authorities to determine whether there are any legal obstacles to the parties ’ marriage, failing which they cannot be refused to marry each other at any given chosen time following the statutory waiting period of 1 month (see paragraphs 24-25)."

The Court accepts that the prison authorities were entitled to make their permission subject to conditions on which the applicant ’ s marriage was to take place, in particular having regard to the demands of security and prevention of disorder in prison (see paragraphs 53 and 55 above). However, it does not see any reason why they should – as they did in the present case – evaluate the depth of the applicant ’ s feelings, debate on the quality of his relationship and make remarks implicitly or explicitly criticising his decision to marry a particular person, based solely on the circumstances in which he found and chose his intended wife.",
                "Obviously, detention facilities are not typical places for bringing together future partners but the fact that the bond between a man and a woman developed when they both have been detained does not automatically render their relationship “illegal”, “superficial”, having no rehabilitative value or not deserving respect."

The choice of a partner and the decision to marry him or her, at liberty and in prison alike, is a strictly private and personal matter and there is no universal or commonly accepted pattern for such a choice or decision. Except for overriding security considerations and in order to ensure that the right to marry is exercised “in accordance with the national laws” – which, as said above, must themselves be compatible with the Convention – the authorities are not allowed under Article 12 to interfere with a prisoner ’ s decision to establish a marital relationship with a person of his choice, especially on the grounds that the relationship is not acceptable to them or deviates from prevailing social conventions and norms (see paragraphs 48-49 and 53 above ).",
                "Some administrative arrangements must of course be made by the prison authorities before a prisoner can marry. However, the same applies to other Convention rights, such as the right of access to a court, the right to vote and the right to respect for family life and correspondence, the exercise of which in prison requires, by the nature of things, a positive action on the part of the authorities to make the enjoyment of those right effective (see Hirst (no. 2) cited above, § 68; Draper cited above, § 55; and paragraphs 51-52 above)."

It is for them to decide whether they wish to enter such relationship in circumstances in which there are objective obstacles to their living together (see Hamer cited above and paragraph 48 above). In the present case the only reason why the applicant was unable to exercise his right to marry was not his ineligibility caused by the existence of any statutory obstacle listed in the Polish Family and Custody Code but the fact that the authorities disputed his decision to marry M.H. and refused him permission to have the necessary civil status celebration held in prison. In practice, the refusal had identical consequences as an effective legal bar on the exercise of his right guaranteed by Article 12. This, having regard to the scope of the State ’ s discretion accorded under this provision ( see paragraphs 48-50 above ), cannot be justified by any conceivable legitimate aim pursued by the authorities."

In their submission, these circumstances were relevant for the applicant ’ s status as a victim and for the assessment of the merits of his complaint under Article 12 ( see paragraphs 30 and 41-42 above ).",
                "The Court does not accept this argument. The Government seem to suggest that the fact that the applicant obtained the leave he sought some 5 months after he had made his request to the authorities (see paragraphs 11 and 19 above) or that he retained the possibility of marrying M.H. at some unspecified future stage could alleviate the consequences of the initial ban placed on the exercise of his right to marry. However, a delay imposed before entering into a marriage in respect of persons of full age and otherwise fulfilling the conditions for marriage under the national law, be it a civil sanction or the practical consequence of such a refusal as in the instant case, cannot be considered justified under Article 12 of the Convention (see F. v. Switzerland cited above, § 33-37). Consequently, the Court rejects the Government ’ s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of incompatibility ratione personae ( see paragraphs 32-33 above )."

It submitted that, as shown by the facts supplied by the applicant, the authorities ’ discretion in granting or refusing a detained person the right to marry is unlimited. There are no rules stating in which circumstances a request for leave to marry in a detention facility can be refused and no time-limits are set for handling such requests (see paragraphs 45-47 above)."

It is also true that no specific provision of the national law deals with marriage in detention but, in the Court ’ s view, Article 12 does not require the State to introduce separate laws or specific rules on marriage of prisoners; thus, as stated above, detention is not a legal obstacle to marry (see paragraphs 51-53 above ).

The discretion available in theory may be very wide, but the decisive element is how it is applied in practice. In the applicant ’ s case the Convention breach was caused by the authorities ’ failure to strike a fair balance of proportionality among various public and individual interests at stake in a manner compatible with the Convention, rather than by the absence of detailed rules on marriage in prison.

On 22 January 1960 Istanbul City Council (“the city council”) had been granted use of the land, which belonged to the Forestry Commission (and therefore to the Treasury), for a term of ninety-nine years. Situated on a slope overlooking a valley, the site spread out over a surface area of approximately 35 hectares and from 1972 onwards was used as a rubbish tip by the districts of Beykoz, Üsküdar, Kadıköy and Ümraniye under the authority and responsibility of the city council and, ultimately, the ministerial authorities.",

The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CH 4 in the air is between 5% and 15%. If the level rises above 15%, methane will catch fire but will not explode."

The Government argued that the Chamber’s conclusion that “all situations of unintentional death” came within the scope of Article 2 had given rise to an unprecedented extension of the positive obligations inherent in that provision. In their submission, the Chamber’s reasoning departed from the position adopted by the Court in recent cases on the subject, such as Mastromatteo v. Italy ([GC], no. 37703/99, ECHR 2002-VIII), and was not supported by the cases to which it had referred, in particular Osman v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII) and Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), in which no violation of Article 2 had been found."

Otherwise, it might be inferred that the mere fact of being near an airport, a nuclear power station or a munitions factory or of simply being exposed to chemicals could give rise to a potential violation of Article 2."

The Government’s main submission was that the decisive piece of evidence in the Chamber’s assessment had been an expert report drawn up on 7 May 1991, which had given rise to a dispute between the various councils and had never been treated as evidence under domestic law. The Chamber’s assessment, characterised by its failure to test the criteria of “immediacy” and “reality” in relation to the danger posed by the municipal rubbish tip, had not been sufficient to justify the finding of a violation, which had been based on the consideration that the authorities should have taken preventive measures or intervened immediately and appropriately.",

France (no. 44617/98, 16 January 2001) and Álvarez Ramón v. Spain (no. 51192/99, 3 July 2001), argued that the Court had always confined itself to ascertaining whether a regulatory framework had been in place and had been complied with, without conducting a detailed examination of whether there was a causal link between the death or deaths in question and any negligent conduct.

As they had done before the Chamber, they mentioned the efforts made by Ümraniye District Council through judicial, administrative and information channels, well before the submission of the expert report on 7 May 1991, to curb unauthorised housing, to encourage the Ümraniye slum inhabitants to find alternative accommodation and to avert the health risks in the area by constantly spraying chemicals over the municipal rubbish tip.

In such circumstances, the Court was not entitled to impose its own point of view as to what might have been the best policy to adopt in tackling the social and economic problems of the Ümraniye slums, including the inhabitants’ known resistance to any measure posing a potential threat to their everyday lives."

In the instant case, criminal proceedings had been instituted, and from the opening of the investigation to the end of the proceedings the Turkish criminal justice system had demonstrated great efficiency and diligence not open to criticism under Article 2 of the Convention. In this connection, the Government disputed any allegation that the mayors in question had been granted impunity. They argued that the fact that Article 230 of the Criminal Code had been the only provision applied in the mayors’ case had been due to the “specific nature of the offence defined in that Article”, which applied solely to public officials, and that the trial court had imposed the statutory minimum penalty because there were other presumed co-principals who had not been indicted."

Turkey (no. 21422/93, § 85, 16 November 2000).

The Environment Office had called for the tip to be brought into line with the standards laid down in regulations 24 to 27 of the Regulations on Solid-Waste Control, the last-mentioned of which explicitly required the installation of a “vertical and horizontal drainage system” allowing the controlled release into the atmosphere of the accumulated gas (see paragraph 56 above)."

In the specific circumstances of this case, neither the criminal-law process nor the administrative-law action had complied with the procedural obligations under Article 2 or proved capable of affording appropriate redress for the applicant’s complaints. In the first place, the criminal proceedings were conducted in such a way that the focus was shifted from the all-important life-endangering aspect of the case to a determination of whether or not the mayors could be held liable for “negligence in the performance of their duties”. Secondly, the compensation awarded to the applicant by the administrative court did not at all correspond to the applicant’s real loss.

Likewise, it did not fall to the Court in Strasbourg to question the verdict reached by a domestic court on the basis of the material before that court, unless it intended to go so far as to substitute what it considered to be a proper verdict. The Government observed that neither the Convention nor its case-law compelled the authorities to secure the conviction of a defendant. The Chamber’s suggestion that the verdict handed down against the mayors was tantamount to granting them almost total impunity had ignored both this point and the national authorities’ discretion to classify criminal charges in the light of the circumstances of a particular case, including situations like the one obtaining in the present case, where the applicant had never complained that the mayors were guilty of unlawful killing through negligence."

He had in fact capitalised on his new dwelling, firstly by renting it out for 48.46 United States dollars (USD) per month, compared with the USD 17.50 which he was paying back to the authorities, and then by agreeing to sell it for 20,000 German marks, a price which was far in excess of the house’s value when it was first allocated to him (TRL 125,000,000). The Government further contended that, contrary to the Chamber’s finding, the compensation claim had been determined within a reasonable time, and certainly within a much shorter time-frame than, for example, in Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), where the Court had found that the period of six years and three months taken to determine a civil claim for death by negligence could not be said to raise an issue under Article 2.

However, it is to be observed that those cases, arising out of the conflict in south-east Turkey in the 1990s, were characterised by the absence of any such investigations into the applicants’ complaints that a close relative had been unlawfully killed by members of the security forces or had died in suspicious circumstances.",

In that connection they submitted examples of advertisements for similar flats in that district at prices of, on average, between 11,000,000,000 and 19,000,000,000 Turkish Liras (TRL) (approximately EUR 7,900 and EUR 13,700 respectively).

                "169. As to the alleged loss resulting from the destruction of the applicant’s dwelling, the Court observes at the outset that, in the absence of any substantiation, the sum claimed would appear excessive. In this connection, it considers that the economic interest which the subsidised housing acquired by the applicant may have represented should be taken into account in the assessment of damage (see paragraph 156 above), although this task is complicated both by the constant fluctuation in the rates of exchange and inflation in Turkey and by the transactions carried out by the applicant in relation to his flat (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Chamber’s assessment was based on the assumption that the value of the applicant’s dwelling that was destroyed amounted to 50% of the cost of decent housing offered at the time by Istanbul City Council in the Çobançeşme area. The Grand Chamber notes in this connection that, according to a list drawn up on 20 March 2001 by the city council, the council was offering housing in the Çobançeşme area for approximately TRL 10,400,000,000, which on that date was equivalent to EUR 11,800.",
                "That information apart, the Court observes, again on the basis of its own – inevitably approximate – calculations, that on 13 November 1993, when the contract for the sale of the flat to the applicant was signed, the agreed price of TRL 125,000,000 was equivalent to approximately EUR 8,500, a quarter of which (EUR 2,125) was paid immediately. The remainder (equivalent to EUR 6,375) was to be paid in 120 monthly instalments of TRL 732,844. On 13 November 1993 the monthly instalments were equivalent to approximately EUR 53. However, on 24 March 1998, the date on which the applicant promised to sell his flat to E.B., the instalments corresponded to only EUR 3. According to calculations on the basis of the exchange rates in force between 13 November 1993 and 24 March 1998, the average value of the instalments was EUR 15. As there is no reason to believe that the applicant continued to pay the instalments after 24 March 1998, it can be presumed that by that date he must have paid, in addition to the down payment, the equivalent of approximately EUR 780 in monthly instalments towards the purchase of the flat, making a total of approximately EUR 3,000, which is significantly lower than the initial value of the flat.",
                "It should also be borne in mind that from at least February 1995 onwards, if not well before that date, the flat in question had been let to a certain H.Ö. for a monthly rent of TRL 2,000,000 (approximately EUR 41). In the thirty ‑ seven months during which the flat was leased, ending on 24 March 1998 when the undertaking to sell it was signed, the applicant must therefore have received a minimum of approximately EUR 1,500 in rent, whereas during the same period he had had to pay only EUR 550 in monthly instalments.",
                "Furthermore, on signing the undertaking to sell the flat, the applicant received 20,000 German marks from E.B.; that sum, equivalent at the time to EUR 10,226, is significantly higher than any amount the applicant would ultimately have had to spend on the purchase of his flat.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, assuming that the market value of the applicant’s slum dwelling may be estimated according to the criterion adopted by the Chamber and that he must have spent a certain amount on accommodation while his flat was being let out, there is still no reason for the Court to conclude that those circumstances resulted in a loss greater than the profit the applicant seems to have made from the transactions relating to his flat.",

In making that award, however, the court refused to take into account any electrical appliances allegedly owned by the applicant, on the ground that his dwelling did not have electricity (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the compensation awarded has never been paid to the applicant. The Court refers to its conclusions on these particular points (see paragraphs 152, 153 and 156 above) and considers that the outcome of the administrative proceedings cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention.",

By the beginning of February 2000 up to 25,000 persons were living there, including local residents and internally displaced persons from elsewhere in Chechnya. In the period leading up to 4 February 2000 the residents of Katyr-Yurt were not informed by the State authorities about the possible advance of illegal fighters into the village, even though such information was available to the military commanders. On 4 February 2000 the village was captured by a large group of Chechen fighters escaping from Grozny. The Russian military forces carried out an assault, using indiscriminate weapons such as heavy, free-falling aviation bombs, artillery, missiles and other weaponry. Although the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry, the residents of the village were provided neither with sufficient time to prepare to leave nor with safe exit routes to escape the fighting. The two exits from the village were controlled by the military by means of roadblocks. The residents were allowed to leave through the roadblock on the road leading towards the district centre of Achkhoy-Martan, but the other one, on the road leading towards Valerick, remained closed during most of the fighting.

According to the text, on the night of 3 to 4 February 2000 a group of between three and four thousand fighters under the command of field commander Gelayev had entered Katyr-Yurt (also spelled Katar-Yurt). They were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine guns, flame -throwers, portable anti-aircraft launchers and armoured vehicles. On 4 February 2000 the head of the operations centre (OC) of the Western Zone Alignment in Chechnya gave orders to block the village to carry out a special operation. By that time, most inhabitants had left the village and others were hiding in their houses. The decision to evacuate the civilians was taken between 7 and 11 a.m. on 4 February. The population had been informed of this possibility through the head of the administration and by means of a loudspeaker device mounted on a helicopter. Following skirmishes on the outskirts of Katyr-Yurt and casualties suffered by the security forces, at 9 a.m. artillery started to carry out pin-point strikes aimed at clusters of fighters in the centre and on the periphery of the village. After sustaining casualties, a reconnaissance group retreated from Katyr-Yurt on the morning on 4 February, following which attack aircraft were called in. Due to the fierce fighting and the artillery and air strikes upon the clusters of fighters, the residents started to leave, and by midday on 4 February “their outflow had become significant”. The extract stated that the special operation had continued for two days, although the strikes continued until 7 February. On the third night [presumably the night of 6 to 7 February] a significant proportion of the fighters, numbering about 800 in all, had left the village under cover of poor visibility and escaped into the mountains; 386 had been killed during the operation. The commanders of the special operation had taken measures to arrange the evacuation of civilians but their plans had been upset by the fighters, especially in the initial stages of the operation. Many residents trying to leave the village had been caught in the crossfire between the fighters and the security forces. Most residents had been killed or injured in the initial stages of the operation, in the central part of the village where the most intense fighting had taken place. No conclusive figure of injured or dead civilians, fighters or security forces was given in the extract."

After the defeat suffered in the plains of Chechnya and in Grozny, [ the illegal insurgents] attempted to move into harsh southern mountainous regions where they would be able to take rest and recover, in order to organise further military action. ... A very difficult situation developed in the area covered by the Western Zone Alignment. Their main task was to prevent the illegal insurgents from breaking through from the mountainous areas of Chechnya to the plains, to identify, disarm and detain members of the illegal armed groups, and to destroy them in the event of armed resistance ...",

In order to prevent any further gathering of the fighters, it was decided to surround the village and carry out a special operation there ... A plan for the special operation was worked out. The plan detailed the detachments responsible for blocking and searching, the order of fire contact in the event of armed resistance by the fighters, the location of the command headquarters and control points ... The artillery targets were established in advance along the lines of the fighters ’ possible escape routes from Katyr-Yurt and potential arrival of reinforcements, outside of the village. Two control points (roadblocks) were established at the two ends of the village to ensure the exit of civilians – one towards Achkhoy-Martan and the other towards Valerik. The civilians left the village through the two roadblocks, along ‘ humanitarian corridors ’.",
                "The head of Katyr-Yurt was informed of the decision to carry out a special operation. He requested postponement in order to ascertain the situation with his own resources and to drive the fighters out of the village. The special operation was postponed for one day. However, the following morning the fighters attacked OMON [special police forces] based in Katyr-Yurt and attempted to break through the lines of the security forces. The security forces sustained casualties. As became apparent during the clashes, the fighters were armed not only with firearms, but also with grenades and fire-launchers, large calibre machine guns, mine-launchers and anti-tank rocket launchers. The fighters were well prepared and were able to use artificial and natural hiding places in order to deliver combat in a populated area. The number of fighters greatly exceeded the security forces ( by 4-6 times).”"

As to the aircraft, they had used aviation bombs and unguided and guided missiles of undisclosed types. The number of aircraft involved and the number and timing of the mission sorties, as well as the number of missiles and bombs used, was not specified. As cited, the report established that during the mission sorties the pilots had received information from the forward controllers, because the missions were taking place in the vicinity of, or within, the populated area. The target selection was done using smoke pods or by reference to clearly identifiable topographical “ highpoints ”. There was no evidence of provocations by fighters or mistakes in selecting targets. The document went on to state that the identification of targets had occurred on the basis of information received prior to departure, from the forward air controllers during the flight, and from the observed activity. Since their use by illegal insurgents could not be verified, attacks on vehicles were ruled out unless very precise and distinguishable directions had been received from the ground. The aircraft attacked from a height of about two kilometres and from a distance of about two kilometres; from that distance details such as clothing and the presence of firearms could not be distinguished.

As to the number of fighters, the statement of appeal referred to various figures cited in the extract and emphasised the fact that the source of this information had not been identified. Likewise, there was a lack of clarity as to the number of fighters killed, nor were there any indications as to any names, identification procedures etc. The appeal statement also pointed out that the number of the security force personnel involved had not been given; it was therefore difficult to evaluate the numerical superiority of the fighters and the need to employ massive weapons. Furthermore, the victim challenged the statement that the administration and population of Katyr-Yurt had been informed about the operation in advance, pointing to the absence of any clear evidence in the case-file to that effect. Turning to the roadblocks set up by the security forces, the appeal statement pointed out that there were no grounds for concluding that this measure had facilitated the exit of civilians from Katyr-Yurt and reiterated the findings made in this respect by the Court in the judgments in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others cases (both cited above, § § 194 and 199, accordingly). As to the details of aircraft bombing, it was argued that the investigators had accepted two mutually incompatible versions and no steps had been taken in order to clarify whether the pilots, or the aviation controllers who had coordinated the fire, had been able to observe and distinguish legitimate targets (members of illegal armed groups) from civilians. It was also pointed out that the employment of unguided missiles and free-falling general purpose bombs in any event ruled out the possibility of limiting the impact to the selected targets."

                "55. The victim appealed. In her appeal of 23 December 2013 it was stressed that the breach of procedural obligations under Article 2 in this case had taken on a lasting character. Pointing to the relevant passages in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, both cited above, the appeal argued that the following fundamental defects of the investigation, as identified by the Court, had not been corrected in the new round of proceedings: there had been no independent evaluation of the proportionality and necessity of the lethal force used; no individual liability had been established for the aspects of the operation which had led to civilian losses, and these aspects had not been studied and evaluated by an independent body, preferably a judicial one. It was reiterated that the expert report of September 2012, as cited in the decision of 9 March 2013, had simply repeated the findings of two previous expert reports which had already been examined by the Court. Like the previous two, it had not been based on the pertinent facts of the case. Finally, the important question of the total number of victims had still not been resolved, as demonstrated by the failure to include some of the victims ’ deceased relatives in the total."

He concentrated on the relevant precepts of international humanitarian law and the practice of international criminal tribunals which, he argued, should have guided the investigator in his examination of the case. In his view, the decision of 9 March 201 3 had failed to take into account the relevant interpretation of these provisions in so far as it concerned the definition of victims as civilians, and the widespread, systematic, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on them."

The Plenary stressed that, in declaring a law enforcement authority ’ s specific action or failure to act unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to quash the impugned decision or to order the official responsible to revoke it and could only ask him or her to rectify the shortcomings indicated.

                "“ I. The need to combat impunity",
                "1. These guidelines address the problem of impunity in respect of serious human rights violations. Impunity arises where those responsible for acts that amount to serious human rights violations are not brought to account.",
                "2. When it occurs, impunity is caused or facilitated notably by the lack of diligent reaction of institutions or state agents to serious human rights violations. In these circumstances, faults might be observed within state institutions, as well as at each stage of the judicial or administrative proceedings.",
                "3. States are to combat impunity as a matter of justice for the victims, as a deterrent with respect to future human rights violations and in order to uphold the rule of law and public trust in the justice system.",
                "1. These guidelines deal with impunity for acts or omissions that amount to serious human rights violations and which occur within the jurisdiction of the state concerned.",
                "2. They are addressed to states, and cover the acts or omissions of states, including those carried out through their agents. They also cover states ’ obligations under the Convention to take positive action in respect of non-state actors.",
                "3. For the purposes of these guidelines, “serious human rights violations” concern those acts in respect of which states have an obligation under the Convention, and in the light of the Court ’ s case law, to enact criminal law provisions. Such obligations arise in the context of the right to life (Article 2 of the Convention), the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 3 of the Convention), the prohibition of forced labour and slavery (Article 4 of the Convention) and with regard to certain aspects of the right to liberty and security (Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Convention) and of the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 of the Convention). Not all violations of these articles will necessarily reach this threshold.",
                "4. In the guidelines, the term “perpetrators” refers to those responsible for acts or omissions amounting to serious human rights violations.",
                "5. In the guidelines, the term “victim” refers to a natural person who has suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering or economic loss, caused by a serious human rights violation. The term “victim” may also include, where appropriate, the immediate family or dependants of the direct victim. A person shall be considered a victim regardless of whether the perpetrator of the violation is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted, and regardless of the familial relationship between the perpetrator and the victim.",
                "6. These guidelines complement and do not replace other standards relating to impunity. In particular, they neither replicate nor qualify the obligations and responsibilities of states under international law, including international humanitarian law and international criminal law, nor are they intended to resolve questions as to the relationship between international human rights law and other rules of international law. Nothing in these guidelines prevents states from establishing or maintaining stronger or broader measures to fight impunity.",

These provisions should be applied by the appropriate executive and judicial authorities in a coherent and non-discriminatory manner.",
                "- States should provide for the possibility of disciplinary proceedings against state officials.",
                "- In the same manner, states should provide a mechanism involving criminal and disciplinary measures in order to sanction behaviour and practice within state authorities which lead to impunity for serious human rights violations.",

                "3. States should elaborate policies and take practical measures to prevent and combat an institutional culture within their authorities which promotes impunity. Such measures should include:",
                "- promoting a culture of respect for human rights and systematic work for the implementation of human rights at the national level;",
                "- establishing or reinforcing appropriate training and control mechanisms;",
                "- introducing anti-corruption policies;",
                "- making the relevant authorities aware of their obligations, including taking necessary measures, with regard to preventing impunity, and establishing appropriate sanctions for the failure to uphold those obligations;",
                "- conducting a policy of zero-tolerance of serious human rights violations;",
                "- providing information to the public concerning violations and the authorities ’ response to these violations;",
                "- preserving archives and facilitating appropriate access to them through applicable mechanisms.",
                "4. States should establish and publicise clear procedures for reporting allegations of serious human rights violations, both within their authorities and for the general public. States should ensure that such reports are received and effectively dealt with by the competent authorities.",
                "5. States should take measures to encourage reporting by those who are aware of serious human rights violations. They should, where appropriate, take measures to ensure that those who report such violations are protected from any harassment and reprisals.",
                "6. States should establish plans and policies to counter discrimination that may lead to serious human rights violations and to impunity for such acts and their recurrence.",
                "7. States should also establish mechanisms to ensure the integrity and accountability of their agents. States should remove from office individuals who have been found, by a competent authority, to be responsible for serious human rights violations or for furthering or tolerating impunity, or adopt other appropriate disciplinary measures. States should notably develop and institutionalise codes of conduct.",
                "1. Combating impunity requires that there be an effective investigation in cases of serious human rights violations. This duty has an absolute character.",
                "The right to life (Article 2 of the Convention)",
                "The obligation to protect the right to life requires, inter alia, that there should be an effective investigation when individuals have been killed, whether by state agents or private persons, and in all cases of suspicious death. This duty also arises in situations in which it is uncertain whether or not the victim has died, and there is reason to believe the circumstances are suspicious, such as in the case of enforced disappearances.",
                "4. A decision either to refuse to initiate or to terminate investigations may be taken only by an independent and competent authority in accordance with the criteria of an effective investigation as set out in guideline VI. It should be duly reasoned.",
                "5. Such decisions must be subject to appropriate scrutiny and be generally challengeable by means of a judicial process.",
                "VI. Criteria for an effective investigation",
                "In order for an investigation to be effective, it should respect the following essential requirements:",
                "The investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This does not create an obligation on states to ensure that the investigation leads to a particular result, but the authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident.",
                "The investigation should be comprehensive in scope and address all of the relevant background circumstances, including any racist or other discriminatory motivation. It should be capable of identifying any systematic failures that led to the violation. This requires the taking of all reasonable steps to secure relevant evidence, such as identifying and interviewing the alleged victims, suspects and eyewitnesses; examination of the scene of the alleged violation for material evidence; and the gathering of forensic and medical evidence by competent specialists. The evidence should be assessed in a thorough, consistent and objective manner.",
                "Persons responsible for carrying out the investigation must be impartial and independent from those implicated in the events. This requires that the authorities who are implicated in the events can neither lead the taking of evidence nor the preliminary investigation; in particular, the investigators cannot be part of the same unit as the officials who are the subject of the investigation.",
                "The investigation must be commenced with sufficient promptness in order to obtain the best possible amount and quality of evidence available. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. The investigation must be completed within a reasonable time and, in all cases, be conducted with all necessary diligence.",
                "There should be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability, to maintain public confidence in the authorities ’ adherence to the rule of law and to prevent any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Public scrutiny should not endanger the aims of the investigation and the fundamental rights of the parties.",
                "VII. Involvement of victims in the investigation",
                "1. States should ensure that victims may participate in the investigation and the proceedings to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests through relevant procedures under national law.",
                "2. States have to ensure that victims may, to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests, receive information regarding the progress, follow-up and outcome of their complaints, the progress of the investigation and the prosecution, the execution of judicial decisions and all measures taken concerning reparation for damage caused to the victims.",
                "5. Where participation in proceedings as parties is provided for in domestic law, states should ensure that appropriate public legal assistance and advice be provided to victims, as far as necessary for their participation in the proceedings.",
                "1. States have a duty to prosecute where the outcome of an investigation warrants this. Although there is no right guaranteeing the prosecution or conviction of a particular person, prosecuting authorities must, where the facts warrant this, take the necessary steps to bring those who have committed serious human rights violations to justice.",
                "2. The essential requirements for an effective investigation as set out in guidelines V and VI also apply at the prosecution stage.",
                "States should also consider establishing non-judicial mechanisms, such as parliamentary or other public inquiries, ombudspersons, independent commissions and mediation, as useful complementary procedures to the domestic judicial remedies guaranteed under the Convention.",
                "States should take all appropriate measures to establish accessible and effective mechanisms which ensure that victims of serious human rights violations receive prompt and adequate reparation for the harm suffered. This may include measures of rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction, restitution and guarantees of non-repetition.”",

Firstly, crucial facts pertinent to the events of 4-7 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt had not been established. These included the total number and the names of civilians, illegal fighters and servicemen who had died or been injured; the number of illegal fighters and the number of security forces involved; the time when and the manner in which the population had been informed of the operation and the possibility to leave the village; the instructions given to the personnel manning the roadblocks; the selection of targets and ammunition used; the establishment of individual responsibility for the deaths and injuries of the civilians. Secondly, the investigation had failed to resolve a number of important, paradoxical contradictions contained in the case-file, such as the intelligence behind the choice of targets in the village for the aircraft and artillery. Finally, the investigators had declined to evaluate the legitimacy of the commanders ’ actions, relying instead on the military experts ’ conclusions as to the compliance of their actions with the military manuals.

They referred to the conclusions of the criminal investigation that the use of lethal force had been prompted by the active resistance of the illegal armed groups, whose actions had posed a real threat to the life and health of servicemen and civilians, as well as to the general interests of society and the State.

Pinpoint attacks by artillery and aviation had been directed against specific targets.

Given the context of the conflict in Chechnya at the relevant time, such measures could presumably include the deployment of army units equipped with combat weapons, including military aviation and artillery. The presence of a very large group of armed fighters in Katyr ‑ Yurt and their active resistance to law-enforcement bodies, which is not disputed by the parties, may have justified the use of lethal force by agents of the State, thus bringing the situation within paragraph 2 of Article 2 ( see Isayeva, § 180 and Abuyeva and Others, § 197, both cited above )."

The two roads out of the village were controlled by Russian military roadblocks. At one of the roadblocks civilians were prevented from leaving the scene of the fighting, on the orders of the operation ’ s commanders. No effort was made by the military to respect the “safe” exit announced to the civilians and the attack on the village continued with the same intensity despite the presence of the large numbers of people who were trying to leave."

It held that the use of artillery and aviation bombs in a populated area, outside wartime and without the prior evacuation of civilians, was impossible to reconcile with the degree of caution expected from a law-enforcement body in a democratic society. Even when faced with a situation where, as the Government submitted, the population of the village had been held hostage by a large group of well-equipped and well ‑ trained fighters, the primary aim of the operation should have been to protect lives from unlawful violence. The massive use of indiscriminate weapons stood in flagrant contrast to this aim and could not be considered compatible with the standard of care prerequisite to an operation of this kind involving the use of lethal force by State agents. The Court also found that in view of the level of danger to which they were exposed, there was no difference between the situation of the applicants and their relatives who had been killed (ibid., § 197 and § 200, respectively )."

In particular, the Court could find no basis for the statements of the military experts that the commanding officers had organised and carried out the evacuation of the population and had chosen a localised method of fire.

In particular, the Court noted that these documents, although fundamental to the investigation ’ s conclusions, had neither been communicated to the victims nor submitted to the Court in full. As far as could be judged from other documents, the reports appeared to endorse the conclusions concerning the proper organisation of the civilians ’ evacuation, the correct choice of weapons and the responsibility of the fighters for the failures of the “humanitarian corridor”, but these conclusions were not supported by the documents made available to the Court. Moreover, the witness statements reviewed by it stood in direct opposition to these conclusions. In view of these findings, the Court judged the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution in June 2007 on the same grounds as those stated in 2002 to be “at the very least, surprising” (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 201)."

                "“ 207. The Court notes that in the Isayeva judgment it concluded that the domestic investigation had been inefficient. It criticised a delay of seven months before the opening of the investigation. Once commenced, the investigator was unable or unwilling to compile crucial information about the “safe passage” announced to the civilians and the observance of it by the military. No one responsible for the declaration or the observance of the safety of the evacuation had been identified among the civilian or military authorities. The Court also found that the investigation did not examine the allegation that the inhabitants of Katyr-Yurt had been “punished” for what was perceived as a lack of cooperation with the military, as transpired from statements made by certain high-ranking servicemen. No questions had been put to the soldiers who had manned the roadblocks as to the nature of the instructions that they had received. The head of the civilian administration of Katyr-Yurt had not been properly questioned about these events. Further, the Court criticised the failure of the investigation to draw a comprehensive picture of the human losses and to identify all the victims of the attack. Communication with those who had victim status in the criminal proceedings had been poor and they had not been notified of the most important procedural decision taken in the proceedings. Lastly, the Court found that the expert report of February 2002 – on the basis of which the investigation had been closed – did not appear to tally with the documents contained in the case file (ibid., §§ 217-23).",

Turning to the period which had elapsed since the adoption of the above-mentioned judgment [in the Isayeva case], the Court notes that a new investigation had taken place between 14 November 2005 and 14 June 2007. During this time, a number of additional witnesses were interviewed, including ten of the applicants and some of their relatives. Several people were granted victim status in the proceedings (see paragraph 158 above). The Government argued that these measures, along with the second report by the military experts, had constituted steps sufficient to comply with the requirements of an effective investigation.",
                "209. In relation to the second report by the military experts, the Court has already stated that it has not been provided with a copy of the report and that, in any event, it could not discern any factual basis for the findings therein (as they are noted in the decision of 14 June 2007: see paragraph 202 above).",
                "210. On the basis of the documents reviewed, the Court concludes that all the major flaws of the investigation indicated in 2005 persisted throughout the second set of proceedings, which ended in June 2007. Most notably, it cannot discern any steps taken to clarify the crucial issues of responsibility for the safety of the civilians ’ evacuation and of the “reprisal” character of the operation against the population of Katyr-Yurt. It does not appear that any additional questions about these aspects of the operation were posed to the military or civilian authorities or to the servicemen involved at ground level. No one was charged with any crime.",
                "211. As the Court has stated on many previous occasions, the essential purposes of a criminal investigation into the loss of life are the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and ensuring the accountability of State agents for deaths occurring under their responsibility. Such an investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in the case at hand was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, § 87, Reports 1998 ‑ I) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, § 88, ECHR 1999 ‑ III). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that these tasks could not be achieved without identifying the individual agents in the military and, possibly, civilian administration, who had borne responsibility for the taking and implementation of the decisions which had entailed such a heavy toll on the civilian population.",
                "212. Furthermore, the Court considers that the decisions to terminate the proceedings – taken by the military prosecutor ’ s office on the basis of the expert reports prepared by army officers – raise serious doubts about the independence of the investigation from those implicated in the events at issue (see Güleç v. Turkey, 27 July 1998, §§ 81-82, Reports 1998-IV, and Oğur, cited above, §§ 91-92). While it is certainly for the competent domestic authorities to determine issues of the guilt and/or innocence of individuals involved, as well as the applicable provisions of national legislation, the Court finds that the matter at issue in the present case, in view of its extreme seriousness, should have been assessed by the courts, which are the ultimate guardians of the laws laid down to protect the lives of persons. The approach of the military prosecutor ’ s office to the investigation into dozens of deaths and injuries suffered by civilians has made it clearly inadequate to fulfil the role of maintaining public confidence in the authorities ’ adherence to the rule of law and to prevent any appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 321, ECHR 2007-..., and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 140, ECHR 2002-IV).",
                "213. Next, the Court notes that, surprisingly, over the seven years after the attack had taken place the investigation failed to compile an exhaustive list of victims. The situation of the twenty-fourth applicant, Mrs Bela Orsamikova, and the deaths of her four relatives had not been taken into account by the time the proceedings were terminated in June 2007, which is even more striking given that her complaint about the present matter had been accepted by the military court in March 2006.",
                "214. Finally, in relation to the need to ensure public scrutiny of the investigation, the Court notes that it does not appear that any substantive information about the proceedings has been communicated to the applicants. The military prosecutor ’ s office failed to inform them about the most important procedural steps taken, in breach of the relevant domestic legislation. The Government did not provide any explanation of this deficiency. The Court considers that this failure constituted a particularly grave breach of the requirement to effectively investigate the use of lethal force by State agents, all the more so given that exactly the same finding was already made by the Court in 2005.",
                "215. To sum up, having examined the investigation carried out after the adoption of the Isayeva judgment, the Court finds that it has suffered from exactly the same defects as those identified in respect of the first set of proceedings which had been terminated in 2002. The Court considers that, aside from the issues under Article 2, this raises a matter under Article 46 of the Convention, which it will discuss below. ”"

As a result of the use of force by State agents, the applicant lost her entire family – both parents and three siblings – at the age of eight, and suffered serious injuries resulting in months, if not years, of treatment. She not only suffered from the direct consequences of the tragic events, consisting of the loss of her family members and her own injuries, but was left without parental care and was therefore clearly identifiable as a particularly vulnerable victim (see Recommendation Rec(2006)8, paragraph 6 8 above). Her situation could not have been entirely unknown to the authorities, given that she and at least one of her siblings, who later died, had been admitted to a municipal hospital. The discharge papers issued by the Nazran hospital referred to the “ direct hit on the [ family ] car”; death certificates for the family members issued by the relevant civil registration office cited splinter wounds and burns as the cause of death (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Finally, in 2001 a witness informed an investigator from the military prosecutor ’ s office of the deaths of six individuals in a Volga car on 4 February 2000 (see paragraph 30 above). Despite that, nothing has been done by the law-enforcement authorities to acknowledge the applicant ’ s situation and to take measures in order to ensure the effective protection of her rights in the course of proceedings. The fate of the applicant ’ s family did not become the subject of investigation until 2007."

The applicant, still a minor, and clearly a particularly vulnerable victim, was not accorded any special protection or the assistance that was due to her. In fact, it appears that she was forgotten about, and in June 2007 – due to mistake, as the Government submitted in 2010 (see paragraph 34 above) – she was not informed of the decision to terminate proceedings. This mistake has been perpetuated over the years, and the decision of March 2013 still failed to name the applicant ’ s deceased relatives among those who had died in Katyr-Yurt on 4-7 February 2000.

                "110. In the Abuyeva and Others judgment cited above, the Court concluded under Article 46 :",
                "“ 236. The Court points out that, in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and to make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore, to the fullest extent possible, the situation existing before the breach. If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to make all feasible reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore, as far as possible, the situation existing before the breach (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 198, ECHR 2004-II; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 47, ECHR 2004-I; and Viaşu v. Romania, no. 75951/01, § 79, 9 December 2008). As the Court ’ s judgments are essentially declaratory, the respondent State remains free, subject to the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII).",
                "237. However, exceptionally, with a view to helping the respondent State to fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court will seek to indicate the type of general measure that might be taken in order to put an end to a situation it has found to exist (see, for example, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 194, ECHR 2004 ‑ V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 141, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). In other exceptional cases, where the very nature of the violation found is such as to leave no real choice between measures capable of remedying it, the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure (see Abbasov v. Azerbaijan, no. 24271/05, § 37, 17 January 2008, and Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 239, 22 December 2008).",
                "238. Turning to the present case, the Court notes, with great dismay, that following the adoption of the Isayeva judgment which found a violation of both substantive and procedural aspects of Article 2, the Committee of Ministers opened a procedure aimed at furthering the execution of the judgment. An information document ( CM/Inf/DH(2006)32 dated 12 June 2007) was prepared to assist the Committee of Ministers in its supervision of the execution by the Russian Federation of the judgments of the European Court relating to the actions of security forces in the Chechen Republic, including the Isayeva case. In respect of the latter case, the document relied on information submitted by the Government that a new investigation had been ordered with a view to examining the proportionality of the lethal force used during the military operation and determining whether measures had been taken to ensure civilians ’ safety. Subsequent documents issued by the Committee of Ministers in respect of this type of case concerned general, as opposed to individual, measures, as those were considered to be a matter of priority (see, for example, the latest document CM/Inf/DH(2010)26 of 27 May 2010).",
                "239. However, as the Court has found in paragraphs 204 and 210-16 above, the second set of proceedings was plagued by exactly the same defects as those observed in the Isayeva judgment. As a result, the Court was once again bound to conclude that no effective investigation capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used had or had not been justified in the circumstances and to the identification and punishment of those responsible had occurred.",
                "240. The Court does not consider it necessary to indicate general measures required at national level for the execution of this judgment. As regards individual measures, the Court observes that it has so far refused to give any specific indications to a Government that they should, in response to a finding of a procedural breach of Article 2, hold a new investigation (see Ülkü Ekinci v. Turkey, no. 27602/95, § 179, 16 July 2002; Finucane v. the United Kingdom, no. 29178/95, § 89, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; Varnava and Others, cited above, § 222; Kukayev v. Russia, no. 29361/02, §§ 133 ‑ 34, 15 November 2007; and Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, §§ 142-43, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts)). In taking this approach, the Court has relied on the general principle that the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment. The Court has also noted the practical difficulties arising out of conducting investigations into events that have occurred many years ago which would almost certainly render such investigations unsatisfactory or inconclusive. It has based its approach on the fact that initial failings of an investigation to take essential measures often make it highly doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could ever be restored (see Finucane, cited above, § 89, and Kukayev, cited above, § 134).",
                "241. In the Court ’ s view, the present case is distinguished by two important features. Firstly, in terms of general principles, the Court notes that the respondent Government manifestly disregarded the specific findings of a binding judgment concerning the ineffectiveness of the investigation. The Court emphasises in this respect that any measures adopted within the execution process must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment (see Assanidze, cited above, § 202, with further references).",
                "242. Secondly, in practical terms, the Court notes that the investigation in the present case has compiled a large amount of data about the events that took place in Katyr-Yurt between 4 and 7 February 2000. On the basis of the existing documents, individual omissions appear to be easily rectifiable. As proof of this, the Court notes that the Government did not dispute the circumstances of the deaths and injuries alleged by those applicants who had not been granted victim status in the criminal investigation but who could submit death certificates and corresponding testimonies. However, to this day no independent study of the proportionality and necessity of the use of lethal force has been carried out, nor has there been any attribution of individual responsibility for the aspects of the operation which had caused loss of life and the evaluation of such aspects by an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature.",
                "243. In view of the above, the Court finds that in the context of the present case it falls to the Committee of Ministers, acting under Article 46 of the Convention, to address the issue of what – in practical terms – may be required of the respondent Government by way of compliance. However, it considers it inevitable that a new, independent, investigation should take place. Within these proceedings, the specific measures required of the Russian Federation in order to discharge its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention must be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in this case, and with due regard to the above conclusions in respect of the failures of the investigation carried out to date. ”"
            ],
            [
                "111. Turning to the new round of proceedings which have taken place since the Abuyeva and Others judgment, the Court has concluded that no previously identified defect of the investigation has been resolved (see paragraph 9 5 above ). The criminal investigation has thus still not succeeded in establishing the relevant factual circumstances concerning the events, including a complete list and causes of the deaths and injuries, or carrying out – on the basis of these factual findings – an independent expert report of the compatibility of the lethal force used with the principle of “absolute necessity”, or attributing individual responsibility between the commanders and the civilian authorities for the aspects of the operation which led to the breach of Article 2. This situation gives rise to particular concerns about the continued impunity of the perpetrators of a serious human rights violation (see the Committee of Ministers Guidelines of 30 March 2011, and paragraphs 6 9 – 70 above). The Committee of Ministers is still awaiting information about the individual measures (see paragraphs 6 5 ‑ 6 7 above). Accordingly, the obligation to abide by the Court ’ s judgments under Article 46 § 1 means that all previous directions concerning the investigation, its scope and focus, remain valid."
            ],
            [
                "112. The Court also notes that the previously ordered individual measures associated with the criminal investigation have so far failed to bring about the required result of redressing the violations found. As a result, yet another breach of Articles 2 and 13 arises from the same set of facts, albeit for a different affected applicant. This situation raises great concern about impunity with respect to a serious human rights violation (see paragraphs 6 9 - 70 above) and thus demands actions over and above those set out in the Abuyeva and Others judgment, cited above (§ 240). In the Court ’ s view, such concerns should be addressed by a variety of both individual and general measures consisting of appropriate reactions from the State institutions, aimed at drawing lessons from the past, raising awareness of the applicable legal and operational standards and at deterring new violations of a similar nature. Such measures could include recourse to non-judicial means of collecting information and establishing the truth about these tragic events; public acknowledgement and condemnation of a serious violation of the right to life in the course of security operation; assessing the adequacy of the national legal instruments pertaining to large-scale security operations and the mechanisms governing military-civilian cooperation in such situations; and greater dissemination of information and better training for both military and security personnel in order to ensure strict compliance with the relevant legal standards, including human rights and international humanitarian law. At the same time, and in line with the findings of paragraph 11 1 above in fine, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings require that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective and that impunity for those responsible for gross human rights violations would not be compatible with the States ’ obligations under the Convention (see Marguš v. Croatia [GC], no. 4455/10, § 127, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."
            ],
            [
                "113. Next, the Court notes that the case at hand provides a compelling example of the need to ensure proper protection of the interests of victims, particularly vulnerable victims. The Russian Federation should take all steps necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the applicant, starting by taking into account in all future proceedings the information concerning her family members ’ deaths, and ensuring that she is fully informed of all relevant procedural steps and is provided with the necessary information and legal advice in sufficiently good time to be able to effectively participate in these proceedings, including commissioning any further expert reports. Independent of the outcome of the criminal investigation, it appears desirable as a matter of urgency to set up and implement an accessible and effective mechanism for the purposes of seeking adequate reparation for the harm suffered by the applicant and other victims in the present case."

                "114. To sum up, the Court finds that in the context of the present case it is incumbent on the Committee of Ministers, acting under Article 46 of the Convention, to continue to address the issue of what may be required of the respondent Government by way of compliance, through both individual and general measures (see also McCaughey and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 43098/09, § 145, ECHR 2013). Within these proceedings, the specific measures required of the Russian Federation in order to discharge its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention must be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgments, and with due regard to the above -mentioned conclusions in respect of the failures of the investigation carried out to date. In the light of the Court ’ s findings, these measures should focus on the continued criminal investigation, but also on non-judicial mechanisms aimed at learning lessons and ensuring the non-repetition of similar occurrences in the future, and ensuring adequate protection of the applicant ’ s rights in any new proceedings, including access to measures for obtaining reparation for the harm suffered.",

At the present time, the proceedings have not yet been terminated in the Belchev, Hamanov, Nedyalkov, Valkov, Kamburov, Kavalovi and Merdzhanov cases. Information is still awaited also on the state of progress in the proceedings in the Kolev and Sidjimov cases.",
                "1) Measures aimed at reducing the length of proceedings",
                "In 2007 a new Code of Civil Procedure (“ CCvP ”) was adopted. The adoption of that code, which came into force on 1 March 2008, forms part of the overall reform of the civil justice system in Bulgaria designed in particular to speed up judicial proceedings. The new code seeks inter alia to concentrate decisions relating to the judicial investigation in the proceedings at first instance and to limit appeal and cassation proceedings.",
                "The most important provisions of the new CCvP provide for:",
                "– the express obligation on civil courts to examine cases within a reasonable time (Article 13);",
                "– the “concentration principle” whereby evidence is brought together in the first instance proceedings; according to this principle, the parties may submit evidence or ask for evidence to be taken no later than the first hearing (Articles 127, 133, 143 and 146); after the first hearing, the parties may only request the taking of evidence which could not be adduced earlier; by way of comparison, the 1952 [C] ode allowed evidence to be submitted throughout the judicial investigation, including elements which could have been submitted earlier, subject to payment of procedural costs;",
                "– the change of second instance from a “second first instance” to an appeal instance, examining only the points raised in the appeal (Article 269), at which the parties may no longer submit evidence and arguments which they could have raised in the court of first instance (Article 266);",
                "– limitation of the grounds for lodging an appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court; henceforth, there are only three categories of judgments handed down by the second-instance courts which can be subject to appeal in cassation (those which are at variance with the case ‑ law of the Supreme Court of Cassation, those relating to a question on which courts deciding on the merits have handed down contradictory judgments, and those relating to a question considered important for the development of law or for the precise application of the law); under the previous cassation system, the Supreme Court of Cassation was competent to judge the lawfulness and validity of the great majority of judicial decisions taken at second instance;",
                "– simplification of summons arrangements, with the possibility of serving a summons by delivering it to the letter-box of the person concerned or affixing it to his/her front door.",
                "The authorities consider that a longer period of time will be needed for the real impact of the new CCvP on length of proceedings to be assessed.",
                "– Administrative measures designed to improve the organisation and management of the courts",
                "Among other reforms designed to improve the efficiency of the Bulgarian judicial system, should be mentioned the creation in 2007 of an electronic commercial register managed by an administrative agency (see the commercial register law in force since 1 July 2007). Thus the regional courts which were responsible for registering commercial companies in the past have been absolved of that responsibility.",
                "Furthermore, following the adoption of the new Code of Administrative Procedure in 2006, 28 administrative courts were set up in 2007. These new administrative courts have powers previously exercised by the regional courts. In addition, as an ad hoc measure aimed at lightening the workload of the Supreme Court of Cassation, labour disputes pending before it when the 2007 CCvP came into force have been transferred to the appeal courts.",
                "It should also be pointed out that the judicial authorities now have access to the national database containing the population register, which should overcome certain delays arising from requests for information needed to take judicial proceedings forward.",
                "Finally, Bulgaria has achieved a high level of computerisation designed to assist both judges and other personnel (for further details, see the 2010 report of the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice – CEPEJ). Moreover, the courts are continuing their efforts to improve their IT equipment in order to communicate with parties. Those efforts were recently rewarded by the award of the 2010 “Crystal Scales of Justice” prize to the Yambol administrative court for the work it has done to improve users ’ understanding of judicial procedure.",
                "– Mechanisms for periodic assessment and monitoring of the work of the courts",
                "Two bodies – the Supreme Judicial Council Inspectorate and the Ministry of Justice Inspectorate – have the main responsibility for monitoring and assessing the work of the courts, prosecution services and investigating magistrates.",
                "The Supreme Judicial Council Inspectorate, established in 2007, comprises an inspector ‑ general and ten inspectors elected by Parliament for terms of five and four years respectively (Article 132a of the Constitution). It oversees the administrative organisation of the courts, prosecution services and bodies in charge of preliminary investigations, together with the proper organisation of preliminary investigations and cases pending before prosecutors and courts. In particular, the inspectorate oversees compliance with the time-limits laid down by law for dealing with cases. It carries out its tasks (a) through planned regional inspections and (b) through inspections focussing on particular questions. It may also conduct inspections in response to reported irregularities ( [sections] 54 and 56 of the [2007 Judiciary Act] ).",
                "Following inspections, it makes recommendations, particularly concerning compliance with the time ‑ limits laid down by law for dealing with cases. Implementation of its recommendations is monitored in the course of follow ‑ up inspections. The inspectorate may also make proposals to courts ’ administrative authorities and to the Judicial Service Commission for the imposition of disciplinary penalties on judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates (see “Disciplinary measures” below). The work of the inspectorate is covered in the progress report of the Supreme Judicial Council.",
                "The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate oversees, among other things, the manner in which case registration and handling are managed, as well as closure of cases within the legal time-limits. This inspectorate organises thematic controls in accordance with a programme approved by the Ministry of Justice. It may make recommendations and supervises their implementation in the course of subsequent inspections.",
                "The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate is also responsible for overseeing application of the new CCvP and CCrP. During inspections already carried out, it has observed some of the causes of procedural delays and made recommendations in this regard.",
                "Furthermore, the presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court are required to present annual reports on the functioning of trial and appeal courts, in addition to annual reports on their own activities ( [sections 114 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and 122 ( 1 ) and ( 2 )] of the [2007 Judiciary Act] ). Lastly, each year the Supreme Judicial Council centralises and analyses the statistics on the work of all the country ’ s courts (cf. Appendix II).",
                "Under the [2007 Judiciary Act], systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down in procedural laws, and action or inaction such as to delay proceedings in an unjustified manner, are disciplinary offences ( [section] 307 § 4). The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ( [section] 311).",
                "The authorities have stated that during the period 2007 ‑ 2009 the number of disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council rose steadily (13 in 2007, 28 in 2008 and 83 in 2009). By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year.",
                "The Bulgarian authorities have adopted several strategies on judicial reforms. For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 2010 ‑ 2014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above).",
                "Further, in 2009 the government adopted a plan to eradicate the causes of violations of the Convention found by the European Court in its judgments concerning Bulgaria. That plan was drawn up by a working party which included representatives of the Ministry of Justice as well as human rights activists. Among the tangible results obtained on the basis of this plan, should be mentioned the working party set up to introduce an application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below). In June 2010 the government adopted the strategy on continued judicial reforms in Bulgaria following its accession to the European Union.",
                "2) Measures relating to the effectiveness of remedies",
                "– Remedy concerning speeding up of civil proceedings",
                "A remedy allowing to question the length of civil proceedings was introduced into Bulgarian law as long ago as 1999 (Article 217a of the former CCvP ). The provisions governing this remedy were maintained to a great extent in the new CCvP of 2007. Articles 255 to 257 thereof stipulate that, if a court fails to take a procedural step in time, the parties may at any time request the superior court to set a deadline for taking the procedural step in question. The request is lodged through the court seized of the case, which must send it to the superior court together with its own opinion. If the court seized of the case takes the requested steps immediately, the request is deemed to be withdrawn unless the party concerned states that it wishes to maintain the request. In cases where the request is transmitted to the superior court, it must be examined within one week by a judge of that court. If he finds that there has been unjustified delay, the superior court sets a deadline by which the procedural step must be taken. The order of the superior court is final.",
                "According to the data supplied by the authorities, the regional courts examined 242 applications for speeding up of civil proceedings in 2007. 110 applications were examined in 2008 and 142 in 2009. Also in 2009, the appeal courts examined 78 applications for the speeding up of proceedings.",
                "The European Court has accepted that the remedy provided for in Article 217a of the former CCvP is effective in principle (see Simizov against Bulgaria, No. 59523/00, § 56, 18 October 2007, Jeliazkov and others against Bulgaria, No. 9143/02, § 48, 3 April 2008, and Stefanova against Bulgaria, No. 58828/00, § 69, 11 January 2007). It has however stated that account must be taken of the circumstances of each case ( Stefanova, cited above, § 69) and of the effect which such application might have on the overall length of the proceedings in question ( Simizov, cited above, §§ 54-56). In several cases the Court has found that the application in question has not or could not have prevented certain delays by reason of their specific causes, such as for example inactivity on the part of the prosecution, inability of the domestic authorities to ensure that one party to the proceedings is properly summonsed, or errors in the application of the law ( Stefanova, cited above, §§ 70 and 71, Mincheva against Bulgaria, No. 21558/03, § 105, 2 September 2010, Maria Ivanova against Bulgaria, No. 10905/04, § 35, 18 March 2010).",
                "Furthermore, the European Court observed that it was unclear whether this remedy was available before the Supreme Court of Cassation, in so far as there was no higher court.",
                "The authorities have indicated that these shortcomings will be taken into account when defining a new application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below).",
                "The European Court has consistently pointed to the absence in Bulgarian law of a remedy enabling compensation to be obtained for excessive length of judicial proceedings (see, for example, the Mincheva against Bulgaria judgment cited above, § 107).",
                "In this connection the Government has indicated that, in the context of implementing a plan to eradicate the causes of the violations found by the European Court in judgments concerning Bulgaria, it has set up a working party to prepare a bill amending the law on the responsibility of the state and municipalities for prejudice caused to individuals. This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities.",
                "As regards criminal proceedings, it should also be noted that certain forms of non ‑ pecuniary redress exist in cases of excessive length of proceedings, such as the possibility of reducing the penalties. This form of redress has been recognised by the European Court as an effective remedy in certain circumstances ( Bochev against Bulgaria judgment of 13 November 2008, § 83).”"

The remedy ’ s shortcomings had been exposed in a number of judgments of the Court. Its successor, the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” under Articles 255 ‑ 57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, was irrelevant because it had been introduced after the end of the proceedings at issue in the present case and because it reproduced the shortcomings of the “complaint about delays”. As evident from examples provided by the Government, the national courts routinely failed to deal with such complaints or requests within the statutory time ‑ limits. The failure of a lower court to comply with a time ‑ limit fixed by the higher court pursuant to such a request could not have any consequences. Moreover, in contrast to previous cases against Portugal and Austria, the statistics supplied by the Government did not show in how many cases the complaints or requests had been allowed, whether any instructions given as a result of them had been complied with, and whether that had in fact led to the acceleration of the proceedings in connection with which they had been made."

The second element contained in the new criterion is intended as a safeguard clause (see the Explanatory Report, § 81) compelling the Court to continue the examination of the application, even in the absence of any significant disadvantage suffered by the applicant, if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto so requires. That wording is drawn from the second sentence of Article 37 § 1 of the Convention, where it fulfils a similar function in the context of decisions to strike applications out of the Court ’ s list of cases. It is also used in Article 38 § 1 as a basis for securing a friendly settlement between the parties. The Court and the former Commission have consistently interpreted those provisions as compelling them to continue the examination of a case when that is necessary because the case raises questions of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention. Such questions would arise, for example, where there is a need to induce the respondent State to resolve a structural deficiency affecting other persons in the same position as the applicant (see Korolev, cited above). As noted in paragraph 39 of the Explanatory Report (cited above), the application of the new admissibility requirement should ensure avoiding the rejection of cases which, notwithstanding their trivial nature, raise serious questions affecting the application or the interpretation of the Convention or important questions concerning national law."

That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach. The only remedies which Article 35 § 1 requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breach alleged and are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these conditions are satisfied (see McFarlane, cited above, § 107, with further references)."

A comprehensive restatement of the relevant principles, as established in Kudła and its progeny, may be found in the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Sürmeli v. Germany ( [GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references) :",
                "(a) Under Article 1 of the Convention, which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (on that point, see also Mifsud v. France ( dec .) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII );",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (on that point, see also Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 186, ECHR 2006 ‑ V );",
                "(e) Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing a claim against the State, such a claim must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, and its sufficiency may be affected by excessive delays and depend on the level of compensation.",

Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, § 52, 8 July 2004; Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no. 47829/99, § 78, 23 September 2004; Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, §§ 66, 67 and 100, 23 September 2004; Todorov v.

However, in one of those cases the Court noted that the applicants had successfully used a “complaint about delays” to prompt a court to give its judgment faster, which indicated that the remedy could be effective in certain circumstances (see Jeliazkov and Others, cited above, §§ 17, 19, 27, 28 and 48)."

After examining the wording of Article 217a of the 1952 Code, it found that the complaint could in principle be an effective remedy, but that regard had to be had to the particular circumstances (see Stefanova v. Bulgaria, no. 58828/00, §§ 68 and 69, 11 January 2007 ). On the facts of Stefanova it was found ineffective, because the delays there had occurred as a result of the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to provide relevant documents and the courts ’ failure duly to notify a party about the delivery of judgment – issues that could not be resolved through a “complaint about delays” (ibid., §§ 70 and 71). In later judgments the Court identified further situations in which that remedy was unlikely to accelerate proceedings. It could not speed up civil proceedings stayed to await the outcome of criminal ones (see Djangozov, § 53, and Todorov, § 61, both cited above). It could not reduce delays due to problems with the service of summons on the defendant (see Simizov, cited above, § 55), or delays due to unjustified remittals of cases to the lower courts (see Givezov, cited above, § 38; Tzvyatkov v. Bulgaria, no. 2380/03, § 31, 22 October 2009; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 42; Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 in fine; and Rosen Petkov, cited above, §§ 34 ‑ 36). It did not seem to apply to proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see Pavlova v. Bulgaria, no. 39855/03, § 31, 14 January 2010; Maria Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 10905/04, § 35, 18 March 2010; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 41; and Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 ). It could not provide effective redress in respect of delays due to the failure of the courts to organise the proper examination of the case, or in situations in which the proceedings had lasted too long without there being identifiable periods of inactivity (see Deyanov v. Bulgaria, no. 2930/04, §§ 69 ‑ 70, 30 September 2010).

Secondly, the major source of delay was not so much the courts ’ failure to schedule hearings at reasonable intervals, but the fact that they did not organise the examination of the case properly, dealt with it over a considerable number of hearings, and failed to gather evidence in a more efficient manner.

In the instant case, there were just four properties to be divided, and just two co ‑ owners (see paragraph 7 above). There were no other disputed points – such as kinship, unjust enrichment, invalidation of will clauses – as is the case in many proceedings relating to the division of the estates of deceased persons (see Hadjibakalov, cited above, § 51). It seems that the only truly contentious point was the divisibility of one of those properties – the house in Sofia. The case could not therefore be regarded as particularly complex."

                "102. Although the parties ’ conduct was at the source of the adjournment of certain hearings and some other delays (see paragraphs 10, 12, 26, 27, 30, 33 and 34 above), the Court considers that the bulk of the delay occurred as a result of the manner in which the domestic courts handled the case. During the first phase of the proceedings, which did not involve any complex issues, the Sofia District Court held no fewer than nine hearings. Four of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities : a failure of the local authorities to provide the parties with plans of the properties, delay in the drawing up of the report of a court ‑ appointed expert, and a failure duly to summon the applicant. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 9 ‑ 13 above). During the second phase the Sofia City Court held ten hearings. Three of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities – delays in the drawing up of the reports of court ‑ appointed experts. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted about four years (see paragraphs 20 ‑ 28 above). It is true that at that stage the issues to be resolved were more complex. However, it does not seem that the delay could be explained by that factor alone. It was due chiefly to the courts ’ manner of proceeding. Much of it could have been avoided if the courts had, from the outset, tried to identify the controversial points and gather evidence in relation to them in a more efficient manner (see, mutatis mutandis, Kiurkchian v. Bulgaria, no. 44626/98, § 69, 24 March 2005, and Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 59913/00, § 94, 2 February 2006 ). Instead, they spread out the examination of the case over a large number of hearings and gathered evidence in a somewhat haphazard manner, acceding indiscriminately to all evidentiary requests of the parties and ordering additional expert reports without a reasonable need to do so. Moreover, some of the intervals between hearings were indeed excessive: more than seven months between those on 20 March and 6 November 2002, more than six months between those on 6 November 2002 and 29 May 2003, and more than eight months between those on 29 May 2003 and 12 February 2004 (see paragraphs 24 ‑ 27 above). The combination of a large number of hearings and excessive intervals between some of those hearings resulted in unreasonably lengthy proceedings."

The bulk of the breaches found by the Court related to the period preceding the adoption of that Code, and were due to a number of legal, organisational and logistic problems causing delay in the examination of civil cases. Some of those had been addressed in the new Code. The principal novelties in the Code were improvements in the rules governing service of process; increased focus on first ‑ instance proceedings and written submissions; limitations on the ability of parties to adduce evidence at later stages of the proceedings; the introduction of judgments by default; the scrapping of the possibility of full rehearing of cases on appeal; the introduction of limitations on the possibilities of appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation; the introduction of simplified procedures for dealing with some categories of straightforward cases; and improvements to the acceleratory remedy existing in the old Code.

This was a pragmatic solution, aiming to avert delays in the quickest possible way rather than discrediting the judge dealing with the case before his or her hierarchical superiors. In the Government ’ s view, that remedy fully complied with the Convention requirements. In 2007 the regional courts had dealt with 242 such requests, in 2008 with 110, and in 2009 with 142. In 2009 the courts of appeal had dealt with 78 such requests."

The number of cases completed in 2009 had increased by 15.46 % in relation to those completed in 2008; that figure was chiefly due to the number coming from the district courts, where the increase had been upwards of 20 %. The number of cases processed in less than three months had also increased in 2009, being 22.62 % higher than in 2008. In 2009, the number of cases resulting in a judicial decision had increased by 19 %.

Despite that, the Bulgarian State had not done enough to tackle the problem. Legislative reforms had been somewhat chaotic, as evidenced by the changes in policy in that domain from one government to the next. The statistics provided by the Government were incomplete, did not show whether undue delays had occurred, and could not serve as a basis to conclude that the problem had been resolved. The reform of the rules of civil procedure was not sufficient because it could not remedy past delays. Moreover, it was too early to say whether that reform would indeed have a positive effect on the length of civil proceedings. Nor could it be accepted that the inspectorates of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Judicial Council would provide a solution to the problem. The Government had not pointed to specific examples of cases in which interventions by those bodies had led to an acceleration of the proceedings.

As for the existing acceleratory remedy, the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay ”, it was too similar to its predecessor to be considered effective. That was fully confirmed by the analysis of the eight examples provided by the Government. In addition, it was unclear what the consequences of the lower court ’ s failure to heed instructions given by the higher court in such a procedure would be. The higher court did not have the power to order the completion of the entire proceedings within a certain time. The statistics provided by the Government showed neither how many of the requests had been granted by the national courts nor whether the requests had actually led to an acceleration of the proceedings. In those circumstances, the remedy under Articles 255-57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure could not be regarded as effective, and there was a clear need for the Court to address the issue in a pilot judgment."

Forty ‑ three cases concerning such complaints have resulted in friendly settlements or have been struck out of the Court ’ s list on the basis of unilateral declarations by the Government (see Annex 2). According to the information in the Court ’ s case management database, there are at present approximately five hundred cases against Bulgaria awaiting first examination which contain a complaint concerning the length of civil proceedings. The above numbers show the existence of a systemic problem (see, among other authorities, Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Lukenda v.

Since the statistics on which the Government relied before the Court to prove that the problem of the excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria has been resolved are largely identical to those that they provided to the Committee of Ministers, the Court sees no reason to come to a conclusion that differs from that of the Committee. It also considers that it is too early to find that the measures taken by the Bulgarian State to prevent unreasonably lengthy proceedings, while certainly to be encouraged, have produced tangible results. Indeed, the statistics supplied by the Government contain no data about the average duration of civil proceedings in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 58 and 107 above)."

The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their judicial systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see König v. Germany, 28 June 1978, § 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, §§ 83 and 84, 16 November 2010 ). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both legal and logistical character. Some of those – such as an insufficient number of judges or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management – may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others – such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence – may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), §§ 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, § 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 40450/04, §§ 90 ‑ 92, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts) ). Indeed, as evident from its Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 and the first Appendix to it, the Committee is already doing so and will continue, in cooperation with the national authorities (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). By way of example, the Court would point to the recent adoption of statutory provisions proclaiming the right to a “ hearing within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 37 above) and the obligation for the courts to “ examine and decide cases within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 45 above)."

Austria ( dec .), no. 70579/01, 15 September 2003). The new Bulgarian remedy seems to suffer from the same shortcomings. According to the prevailing legal opinion, it is – like its predecessor – not applicable to delays in proceedings before the two supreme courts (see paragraph 55 above), and there are no reported examples of its being used in relation to such proceedings.

More importantly, even if it is accepted that the remedy operates effectively, it cannot, by itself and in the absence of a concurrent remedy providing compensation for undue delays in proceedings that have already been completed, solve the problem of unreasonably lengthy proceedings. Indeed, in Scordino (no. 1) ( cited above, § 186) the Court observed that “some States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation”. It also stated that it is clear that for countries where length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings – although desirable for the future – may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., § 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see Žunič v. Slovenia ( dec .), no. 24342/04, 18 October 2007; Tomažič v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, § 37 in fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, § 36, 21 July 2009). In view of what has been said above, Bulgaria can be considered as a country in which length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist. The present case – where the proceedings had lasted three years by the time the “complaint for delays” became available and came to a close before the introduction of the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” (see paragraphs 8, 34, 43 and 49 above) – is a good illustration of that. There is thus a clear need for the introduction of a remedy allowing redress to be made available for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities “ to complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings ” (see paragraph 56 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 57 and 109 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court ’ s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system (see Kudła, § 155, and Scordino (no. 1), § 188, both cited above )."

                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (on this point, see also Magura v. Slovakia, no. 44068/02, § 34, 13 June 2006; Rišková v. Slovakia, no. 58174/00, § 89, 22 August 2006; Šidlová v. Slovakia, no. 50224/99, § 58, 26 September 2006; and Simaldone, cited above, § 30 ). In relation to this criterion, it should be noted that the domestic authorities or courts are clearly in a better position than the Court to determine the existence and quantum of pecuniary damage. In relation to non ‑ pecuniary damage, there exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively lengthy proceedings will cause such damage. Although in some cases the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all, the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to justify its decision to award lower or no compensation by giving sufficient reasons, in line with the criteria set out in this Court ’ s case ‑ law. In this context, it should additionally be pointed out that the presumption that excessively lengthy proceedings will cause non ‑ pecuniary damage applies to both individuals and legal persons ( on this last point, see Provide S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 62155/00, §§ 10, 12, 18 and 24, ECHR 2007 ‑ VIII (extracts) );",

The Court would further emphasise that, to be truly effective and compliant with the principle of subsidiarity, a compensatory remedy needs to operate retrospectively and provide redress in respect of delays which predate its introduction, both in proceedings which are still pending and in proceedings which have been concluded but in which the litigants have already applied to the Court or may do so (see Brusco v. Italy ( dec .), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Nogolica v. Croatia ( dec .), no. 77784/01, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Charzyński v.
