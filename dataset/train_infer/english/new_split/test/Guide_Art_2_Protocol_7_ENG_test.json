According to this procedure, the prosecutor could lodge an extraordinary appeal ( protest ) against the court decision. The applicant successfully used this procedure by lodging a complaint with the Prosecutor's Office, which in turn lodged a protest against the decision of 1 December 1998 which was examined by the HCARC."

The Court recalls that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in determining how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. In certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on that right of review must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 96, ECHR 2001 ‑ II ). The Court also recalls that, to be effective, a remedy must be independent of any discretionary action by the authorities and must be directly available to those concerned (see Kucherenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999 )."

It could only be initiated by a prosecutor or by a motion of the president of the higher court (see paragraphs 30-32 above ). Given that this procedure was not directly accessible to a party to the proceedings and did not depend on his or her motion and arguments, the Court considers that it was not a sufficiently effective remedy for Convention purposes."

As to the Government's argument that the decision ordering the applicant's administrative arrest and detention was actually reviewed by a higher court, the Court finds no evidence that the extraordinary appeal lodged by the Prosecutor's Office was initiated upon the applicant's own motion. Moreover, this appeal reflected the position of the Prosecutor's Office, and not of the applicant. During these proceedings the applicant was not given an opportunity to present any arguments, and the issue under consideration was the dispute between the Prosecutor's Office and the court over the competence to impose a sanction on the applicant. The Court considers that the mere fact that the review initiated by the Prosecutor's Office had some positive, albeit temporary, impact on the applicant's situation, namely the suspension of his sentence, was not in itself sufficient to conclude that the extraordinary appeal was an effective remedy which could have satisfied the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7."

The domestic judicial authorities had refused to examine his appeal under the pretext that the judgment delivered in absentia had not been amenable to appeal and that a retrial had been possible only if the applicant had appeared in person before the court. They had further reasoned that his conviction in absentia could have been re-examined by way of a cassation review. On the contrary, in the Government’s view, the applicant had had an opportunity to appeal against his conviction as provided for by the applicable rules of criminal procedure. As to the application for a cassation review lodged by the lawyer K., the applicant submitted that at the relevant time he had not retained K.’s services or asked him to apply for a cassation review."

Even after his application for restoration of the time-limit for appealing had been dismissed without consideration, he could have reapplied had he considered that the dismissal had been unlawful. The fact that the applicant’s lawyer had applied for a cassation review of the applicant’s conviction confirmed that the applicant had waived his right to appeal, having opted for another type of review."

                "40. The Court reiterates that the Contracting States in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. Thus, the review by a higher court of a conviction or sentence may concern both points of fact and points of law, or be confined solely to points of law. Furthermore, in certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 96, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; and, mutatis mutandis, Naït-Liman v. Switzerland [GC], no. 51357/07, §§ 114-15, 15 March 2018; and Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase v.

                "41. The Court further reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. Unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, the Court’s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of the interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 149, 20 March 2018, and Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], no. 20452/14, § 149, 19 December 2018). However, the authorities should respect and apply domestic legislation in a foreseeable and consistent manner (see Jovanović v. Serbia, no. 32299/08, § 50, 2 October 2012). In cases concerning access to court, it may fall to the Court to determine, in particular, whether the applicant was able to count on a coherent system that struck a fair balance between the authorities’ interests and his own interests (see De Geouffre de la Pradelle v. France, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 253 ‑ B, and Maširević v. Serbia, no. 30671/08, § 48, 11 February 2014)."

                "42. As regards Russian national law (see paragraphs 25-28 above), the Court notes that it provides a defendant convicted in absentia with three avenues, as regards a possibility to challenge a conviction. As a general rule, it is possible to lodge an appeal against a conviction within ten days of the delivery of the judgment by the court at first level of jurisdiction. Furthermore, once the ten-day limit has passed and the judgment has become final, the defendant may either present him- or herself physically before the competent court asking for his conviction to be quashed, by way of cassation appeal, and a retrial, or ask for reinstatement of the time-limit for appeal should he or she consider such reinstatement justified. In this last case the law does not require that the defendant present him- or herself in person to lodge such application. The competent court is to hold a hearing on the issue and to deliver a reasoned decision which itself is amenable to appeal."

He chose to apply for the reinstatement of the time-limit for appeal without presenting himself physically before the court. In response, the District Court’s President refused to entertain the applicant’s request noting, in a non-procedural letter, that conviction in absentia was not amenable to appeal. There was no hearing held. Nor did the President issue a reasoned decision on the matter, as required by law."

France, 23 November 1993, § 35, Series A no. 277 ‑ A). Nevertheless, it does not lose sight that the domestic legislation clearly provides for the right to apply for reinstatement of the time-limit for appeal against conviction in absentia and does not require the applicant’s physical presence for the examination of such request, irrespective of the obligation of the defendant to be eventually physically present at the trial on the merits of the charges brought against him or her once the time-limit for appeal has been reinstated."
