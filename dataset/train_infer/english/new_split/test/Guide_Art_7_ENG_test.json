Consequently, the issue that the Court needs to determine in the present case is what the “penalty” of life imprisonment actually entailed under the domestic law at the material time. The Court must, in particular, ascertain whether the text of the law, read in the light of the accompanying interpretative case-law, satisfied the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability. In doing so it must have regard to the domestic law as a whole and the way it was applied at the material time."

                "146. Although at the time the applicant committed the offence it was clearly provided by the Criminal Code that the offence of premeditated murder carried the penalty of life imprisonment, it is equally clear that at that time both the executive and the administrative authorities were working on the premise that this penalty was tantamount to twenty years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 6 5 above). The prison authorities were applying the Prison Regulations, made on the basis of the Prison Discipline Law (Cap. 286), under which all prisoners, including life prisoners, were eligible for remission of their sentence on the grounds of good conduct and industry. For these purposes, Regulation 2 defined life imprisonment as meaning imprisonment for twenty years (see paragraph 4 2 above). As admitted by the Government, this was understood at the time by the executive and the administrative authorities, including the prison service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment ( see paragraph 6 5 above ). The prison authorities were therefore assessing the remission of the life sentences of prisoners on the basis of twenty years ’ imprisonment. This also transpires from the letter sent by the then Attorney-General of the Republic to the President at that time (see paragraph 5 3 above)."

We completely agree with this judgment to which we refer. Concerning the validity of the Regulations, the Attorney-General of the Republic could probably have looked for other mechanisms for deciding the matter at the time when the competent authorities attempted to implement the specific regulation. We do not make mention here of the constitutional right of the President to grant pardon. With regard to the court ’ s observation that the repercussions of such regulations, if it is assumed of course that they are valid, are not taken into account, we refer in addition to the decision in Anthony Maguire Frederick George Charles Enos 40 Cr.

                "“ ... What is of importance in the present case is the principle set out in the case of Hogben and not the differences in the details of the facts. The principle then that has been laid down in the case of Hogben is that Article 7 applies only to the sentence that is imposed and not to the manner of serving the sentence. Therefore Article 7 does not prohibit a retrospective change in the law or in practice concerning release or conditional release from prison of a prisoner.",
                "I am therefore of the view that the principle set out in Hogben can be applied in the present case. Everything that the learned counsel of the applicant has pleaded has to do with the practice of release from prison. In the instant case the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant and explained to him at the same time that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. What the prison authorities then did, with the F5 form, constitutes an action concerning the execution of the sentence. After the case of Hadjisavvas the Regulations on the basis of which the prison authorities gave the applicant the F5 form, have ceased to apply, with the result that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the applicant by the Assize Court is applicable. What happened was a change in the legal situation concerning the time of the applicant ’ s release. As in the Hogben case, Article 7 § 1 of the Convention is not applicable.",
                "I endorse the principle set out in Hogben. I consider that the applicant cannot derive a right to judicial review on the basis of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention because of the alleged change in the date of his release from prison which does not change the legal basis for his detention. It should be emphasised that his detention is founded on the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him by the Assize Court and this had been explained to him as ‘ imprisonment for the remainder of his life ’. It follows that the relevant suggestion by Mr Demetriades does not stand and is dismissed.",
                "On this occasion, I should add that the decision of the Commission on the issue of interpretation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium ( ‘ Vagrancy ’ cases ) 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12 ) ...",
                "The fact that Hogben is a decision of the Commission does not render it less persuasive. It constitutes a decision of a specialised organ with vast experience in interpreting the Convention. It therefore constitutes an authority of great persuasiveness. I am satisfied about the correctness of the Commission ’ s decision in Hogben, which I have endorsed.",
                "It was further the suggestion of Mr Demetriades that ‘ this kind of sentence imposed on the applicant without the possibility of examination by a Parole Board does not conform with Article 3 of the Convention ’.",
                "I endorse the above approach [in Hogben ]. Its essence is that the change in release policy does not constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. The existence or not of a Parole Board does not form part of the ratio of the decision. This answers the suggestion of Mr Demetriades concerning the absence of a Parole Board in Cyprus. Consequently, his suggestion based on Article 3 of the Convention does not stand and is dismissed.",
                "Finally, I must note that the applicant has sought his release from prison through an order of habeas corpus. As stated, however, in the case of Doros Georgiades (Civil Appeal no. 11355, 3 October 2002), adopting the relevant position of English jurisprudence (see Halsbury ’ s Laws of England, 4th edition, Volume 11, §§ 1472 and 1473):",
                "‘ In general the writ of habeas corpus will not be granted to persons convicted or in execution under legal process, including persons in execution of a legal sentence after conviction on indictment. The writ of habeas corpus will not be granted where the effect of it would be to review the judgment of one of the superior courts which might have been reviewed on appeal or to question the decision of an inferior court or tribunal on a matter within its jurisdiction; or where it would falsify the record of a court which shows jurisdiction on the face of it. ’",

Furthermore, he does not suggest or attempt a review of the Assize Court ’ s judgment, as was wrongly perceived at first instance. We are not going against, as he explained, the Assize Court ’ s judgment but the Republic as a whole. The Regulations were then applicable at that time and since the Assize Court had not annulled them for being unconstitutional, we must conclude that it considered them valid. And since the law does not provide a definition of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’, it was an element of the regulation of the sentence provided. As Mr Demetriades put it, the overall legal situation at the time of the imposition of the sentence, indicated that life imprisonment meant in essence twenty years ’ imprisonment. In addition, even if there was doubt, this had to be taken to the applicant ’ s benefit. Hence, in view of this fact, there was no reason to lodge an appeal against the Assize Court ’ s judgment especially since the applicant had been served with the F5 notice.",

However, as has been decided (see Georgios Mavrogenis v. the House of Representatives and Others (1996) 1 A.A.D. 315, at 341 and Alekos N. Clerides v. the Republic of Cyprus, 20 October 2000), judicial assessment necessarily adjudicates retrospectively on the law or regulation and, as the principle of separation of powers dictates, it does not entail a legislative development. It is a fact, however, that this question, both at first instance and before us, has not been touched upon from this point of view so as to raise the issue of Law no. 62(1)/96.",
                "In any event the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant, expressly specifying that this meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. This was the reason for which it did not examine the question of possible consecutiveness and the appellant ’ s perception that it is inferred that the Assize Court recognised the Regulations as valid is wrong. The Assize Court essentially considered that the Regulations were not connected with the issue of the sentence envisaged for it did not consider that the then existent Regulations changed the fact that in accordance with the law, imprisonment for the remainder of the appellant ’ s life was imposed.",
                "Was this approach wrong? Did in reality the law, viewed as a whole, even in the light of the interpretation suggested by the appellant comparing Article 7 § 1 of the Convention with Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution, envisage imprisonment for only twenty years? We would say that the first- instance judgment was not wrong in finding that this situation corresponded to the one in the case of Hogben. The principle applied, namely that Article 7 § 1 of the Convention does not concern the enforcement of the sentence, which remains one of life imprisonment, is not in question. The Regulations were made on the basis of and for the purposes of the Prison (Discipline) Law, whereas it is the Criminal Code that determines the sentence, in this case mandatory life imprisonment and no other.",

Obviously the constitutional legislation singled out the crimes listed in Article 7 § 2 for exceptional treatment in view of their gravity and their repercussions on the well- being of society.

                "“ The accused has been sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of premeditated murder. This sentence is imposed by the Court mandatorily; since it is the only one provided by the Criminal Code, Cap. 154, as amended by Law no. 86/83, which also amends section 29 of the Criminal Code, the Court cannot impose another sentence for the crime of premeditated murder. After the abolition by this Law of the death penalty, the legislature provided for the above sentence so it would be in agreement with Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. This Article provides for the commutation of a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment, in the event that the President of the Republic exercises his right of pardon on the basis of § 1 of that Article.",

                "... In contrast, Mr Kyprianou argued that the Court must order that the sentence imposed should be served after the one already being served by the accused because, on the basis of the Regulations of 1987 (Official Gazette of the Republic, Annex 3, Part 1 of 13/3/87), which were made by the Council of Ministers and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic after being put before Parliament, the interpretation of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’ is given as meaning ‘ imprisonment for twenty years ’. Regulation 93 of these Regulations provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment may be granted remission of his sentence on the ground of good conduct and industry, not exceeding in total one - quarter of this sentence. Therefore, Mr Kyprianou continued, the sentence of life imprisonment has been determined at a period of twenty years, or fifteen if the convicted person demonstrates good conduct. Consequently, what Lord Parker said in the case of R v. Foy, on which counsel for the accused relied, does not apply. Mr Kyprianou also showed his concern, as Senior Counsel of the Republic, about the possible cases, such as the present one, where one person commits many murders but is only given one sentence of imprisonment for fifteen or twenty years.",
                "Our opinion is that neither Mr Kyprianou nor Mr Clerides is treating the legal issue correctly.",
                "On the basis of everything said by Lord Parker [in the case of R v. Foy (1962) 2 All E.R. 246], life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the time for which the applicant is alive. Accordingly, and since a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed on the accused, no other such sentence can follow. Mr Clerides suggests, however, that the court must issue this order, for he is also basing himself on the Regulations of 1987 and is concerned that, since these Regulations are in force, the accused may possibly be released in fifteen years and thus is not facing the danger of serving another prison sentence of fifteen or twenty years, if the second sentence follows the first one.",
                "Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution provides that a court may not impose a longer sentence than that provided for by the law at the time of the commission of the offence. The Criminal Code indeed provides that the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory and the only sentence following conviction for premeditated murder. In our judgment, the sentence ‘ imprisonment for life ’ means exactly what is stated by the simple Greek words, that is, imprisonment for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person. This interpretation was also given by the Court of Appeal of England in the case of R v. Foy ... As we have already stated, section 203 (2) of the Criminal Code is the only provision prescribing the sentence of life imprisonment as mandatory, and this in the light of the provisions of Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. The Regulations of 1987 were drawn up on the basis of the Prison (Discipline) Law (Cap. 286), which still applies on the basis of the provisions of the Constitution even though it was enacted just when Cyprus became an English colony. The provisions of this law, however, have to be applied in such a way that they comply with the express provisions of the Constitution. We wonder whether these Regulations are not unconstitutional and whether the interpretation of the term ‘ imprisonment for life ’, which is encountered in the Constitution and the Criminal Code, so as to mean ‘ twenty years ’, is arbitrary. We say ‘ we wonder ’ since such an issue has not been raised before us and thus we have no right in this procedure to convey an opinion on this. Another observation that can be made, however, is the following: it appears that the drafters of the Regulations, even if they are valid, did not notice the special provision of section 11 of the above Law (Cap. 286) which concerns life prisoners and provides that they may be released on licence by a decision of the ‘ Governor ’, which may be revoked. The life sentence is specifically provided for in the above Law to last for life, along the lines of the English legal system. This is why Lord Parker stated what we quoted above. Another issue that is raised, even for the purposes of academic debate, is to what extent a law or regulation can provide for the remission, suspension or commutation of a convicted person ’ s sentence in view of the express provision of Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution which bestows this privilege on the President of the Republic with the concurrence of the Attorney-General.",
                "It has been established by judicial precedent that when the court imposes a sentence, it does not take into account regulations, even if they are applicable, that allow for the remission of the sentence when a convicted person displays good conduct. The Regulations of 1987 were made in order to serve the purposes to which the court does not refer when passing the sentence, which is determined on the basis of the applicable legislation and the Constitution. It is therefore up to the competent authorities, when and if the matter is raised at the appropriate time, to take into account what we have mentioned above in the form of legal observations. We have already imposed on the accused the sentence that the law envisages, that is, life imprisonment, and we have nothing else to add .”"

He had submitted a habeas corpus application to the Supreme Court when he was not released on the date that had been given to him as a release date by the prison authorities.

R. 116 and was held to be correct in the light of the provisions of Articles 7 § 2 and 12 § 3 of the Constitution.

This would anyhow be contrary to the provisions of these two sections of the Criminal Code since life imprisonment is mandatory for the crime of premeditated murder whereas for the purposes of section 29, where life imprisonment is a discretionary measure, the courts have the discretion to impose a sentence of a shorter period. A prison sentence for a period shorter than life imprisonment may comprise a sentence longer than imprisonment for twenty years with which life imprisonment is equated on the basis of Regulation 2 of the Prison Regulations. In the case of Georghios Aristidou v.

This adjustment, as we have pointed out, is within the competence of the judiciary (see, inter alia, Diagoras Development v National Bank (1985) 1 C.L.R. 581, and United Pibles Societies (Gulf) v. Hadjikakou (Civil Appeal 7413, decided on 28 May 1990).",
                "The adjustment of the provisions of Cap. 286 ensures that its provisions are compatible with the principle of the separation of powers, which constitutes the judiciary as the sole judge of the punishment of offenders (see, inter alia, Politis (cited above) and The District Officer of Nicosia v. Hadjiyiannis, R.S.C.C. 79; The District Officer of Famagusta v. Demetra Panayiotou Antoni, 1 R.S.C.C. 84; The Superintendent Gendarmerie of Lefka v. Christodoulos Antoni Hadjiyianni, 2 R.S.C.C. 21; Morphou Gendarmerie v. Andreas Demetri Englezos, 3 R.S.C.C. 7; The District Officer of Nicosia v. Michael Ktori Palis, 3 R.S.C.C. 27; The District Officer of Famagusta v. Michael Themistocli and Another, 3 R.S.C.C. 47; Nicosia Police v. Djemal Ahmet, 3 R.S.C.C. 50; The District Officer of Kyrenia v. Adem Salih, 3 R.S.C.C. 69; Miliotis v. The Police (1975) 7 J.S.C. 933).",
                "Consequently, to the degree and extent that section 4, in conjunction with section 9, of Cap. 286 confers power for the determination of the duration of a sentence of imprisonment on an authority other than a judicial one, it is contrary to the Constitution and has ceased to be in force following the proclamation of the Republic. Besides, the granting of power to the Director of Prisons to remit the sentence because of good conduct and industry, under the provisions of Regulation 93, is contrary to the principle of the separation of powers, which precludes the involvement of an executive or administrative organ in the determination of the punishment of an offender. The only authority on whom power is conferred by the Constitution to remit, suspend or commute a prison sentence is the President of the Republic, acting with the concurrence of the Attorney General. The examination of the power to make secondary legislation conferred by sections 4 and 9 of Cap. 286 is not directly required in this case, since neither of the two provisions concerns the serving of a sentence of life imprisonment. The serving of life imprisonment is regulated specifically by the provisions of section 11 of Cap. 286, from which it emerges that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person, subject to the right granted to the President of the Republic to suspend the sentence for such period of time as may be fixed on the release of the convicted person on licence. Section 11 of Cap. 286 is in harmony with the Constitution and has maintained its force after the proclamation of the Republic inasmuch as it is consistent with the powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution .”"

Any prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment after the above Regulations came into force would, in practice, have had a period of five years automatically deducted from the time to be served in prison by way of remission pursuant to Regulation 93. Thereafter, days of remission could be deducted from this five- year period as a consequence of misconduct by the prisoner. It was understood by the Republic ’ s executive and administrative authorities, including the Prison Service, that a life prisoner ’ s misconduct could not result in him being detained beyond the twenty- year point. In fact, because of the very limited number of life prisoners in Cyprus and the dates of their respective convictions, no life prisoner had ever reached the point in his sentence when these provisions were applied directly so as to lead to his release. The release of the nine life prisoners in 1993 had been pursuant to Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in the light of how the Regulations would have operated in their cases."

In its judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, the Supreme Court declared Regulation 93 to be unconstitutional and ultra vires in relation to the enabling primary legislation, namely the Prison Discipline Law. Under Cypriot domestic law, the position was that in proceedings where the constitutionality of subsidiary legislation was raised by a party by way of collateral challenge, the court ’ s judgment only took effect in relation to the particular subject matter of the proceedings. Thus, the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, in which the constitutionality of Regulation 93 had been raised as a collateral issue to Mr Hadjisavvas ’ s habeas corpus application, was only operative so as to determine the ongoing legality of his detention. It also followed from Article 144 § 3 of the Constitution that the above judgment did not operate so as to render Regulation 93 unconstitutional and invalid as against persons other than the parties to that case. In other words, it did not result in Regulation 93 being rendered invalid vis-à-vis other individuals."

Nonetheless, the judgment could not be understood as having retrospective effect such as to impugn the validity of Regulation 93 as it had been applied to other individuals affected by that Regulation. Therefore, the fact that Regulation 93 was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court in 1992 did not have retrospective effect such as to render the Regulation void ab initio for all purposes. It did not, for example, render unlawful any action taken pursuant to Regulation 93 between the date of its enactment and the judgment in Hadjisavvas. Accordingly, at the time of the applicant ’ s offence in July 1987 or at the time he was sentenced in March 1989, Regulation 93 could not have been void or without legal effect in respect of the applicant. After the Hadjisavvas judgment, however, the administrative and executive authorities of the Republic could not lawfully take action, in reliance on Regulation 93, treating it as reducing a life sentence imposed by a court to a maximum of twenty years ’ imprisonment since this would have been inconsistent with the Constitution as authoritatively interpreted by the Supreme Court in that judgment.",

Secondly, he complained that the unexpected reversal of his legitimate expectations for release and his continuous detention beyond the date which had been set for his release by the prison authorities had left him in a state of distress and uncertainty over his future for a significant period of time.

At the outset, the applicant accepted that the imposition on 10 March 1989, the date of his conviction, of a mandatory life sentence, defined by the Regulations as amounting in essence to twenty years, did not constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant drew a distinction between the time the sentence had been imposed in 1989 and after 1996, when the twenty- year definition of a life sentence had been abolished. On the F5 form, which the applicant had received when he had been admitted to prison, it had been clearly marked “twenty years” under the heading “ Sentence ”. He had then been informed that he would be released on 16 July 200 2 subject to his good conduct. Following the commission of a disciplinary offence his release date was delayed until 2 November 2002. However, further to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 19, 5 0 and 5 1 above), in which it had been declared that the Regulations were unconstitutional, and the subsequent repeal of those Regulations in 1996 excluding any possibility of remission for life prisoners, the imposition of mandatory imprisonment had become imprisonment for the rest of one ’ s life."

The applicant stressed that under the legislative scheme currently in force in Cyprus there was no parole board system and no provision was made for the granting of parole to prisoners or for the protection of their rights during the execution of their sentence and their readmission to society. Thus, the principal purpose of the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Cypriot courts and subsequently enforced by the relevant authorities was punitive. This, in the applicant ’ s view, coupled with the mandatory nature of the sentence, was contrary to Article 3 of the Convention ( relying, inter alia, on Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 72, ECHR 2002- VIII). The procedure currently in place granted unfettered discretion to the President and was arbitrary in its nature. In this context the applicant referred to the ex officio report of 26 May 2004 by the Cypriot Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) on the penitentiary system of Cyprus and the conditions of detention in the Central Prisons (see paragraph 6 3 above)."

Although prisoners fell within a specific category of right-holders, they nevertheless had rights that ought to be protected by the authorities ( here the applicant relied on Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61 ). Cypriot law imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in all cases of murder, depriving the courts of the vital discretion which judges should be allowed, having regard to the rights of the convicted person in imposing a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed. In this connection the applicant referred to Recommendation R (92) 17 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States concerning consistency in sentencing, adopted by the Ministers ’ Deputies on 19 October 1991, according to which “whatever rationales for sentencing are declared, disproportionality between the seriousness of the offence and the sentences should be avoided ”.

In this connection the applicant stated that in both France and Italy it had been explicitly recognised that an offender sentenced to life imprisonment had a fundamental right to be considered for release. In addition, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had recognised that a life sentence that had been fully implemented invariably entailed the loss of human dignity and the denial of the controversial right to rehabilitation. A release mechanism had been set up in Germany to ensure that life sentences were not implemented in a way that undermined human dignity by suppressing all hopes of release. Furthermore, it was a general requirement of international human rights law that a convicted person should not be deprived of a second opportunity to return to society, following a non-problematic serving of his punishment and sentence and the completion of a rehabilitation procedure."

As a result, since 2002, he had been subjected to continuing feelings of anguish and uncertainty.

Notwithstanding the gravity of his crime, like all life prisoners, he had sufficient hope for release under domestic law for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention. First of all, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic could, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by a court in the Republic. Secondly, under section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996, the President could, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, order the conditional release of a prisoner, including a prisoner serving a life sentence, at any time. Prisoners were free to apply to the President and the Attorney-General whenever they wished for release under the above provisions. Although release was a matter within the exclusive authority of the President, his decision involved the advice and required the agreement of the Attorney-General, who acted as an independent officer and not as part of the Republic ’ s executive authorities. Consequently, his participation added an element of independence to the process."

In this connection, the Government noted that an expression of genuine remorse on the part of a lifer would be an important consideration though not decisive. The President further determined whether the continued detention of the prisoner was necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence or for protecting the public from risk of serious harm."

                "89. The Government observed that, from an examination of the Commission ’ s and Court ’ s case-law on Article 3, the appropriate test to apply was whether an applicant had been deprived of “all hope of obtaining an adjustment of his sentence” : a test which entailed asking whether the sentence was reducible de jure and de facto. If a sentence of life imprisonment was reducible de jure, the mere fact that the prospects of early release were limited or that the decision about whether to grant early release depended on the discretion of the executive, even if that discretion was not subject to the review of the domestic courts, did not violate Article 3, provided that de facto there was a realistic possibility of that discretion being exercised in the future. A life prisoner would have to show either that early release was a legal impossibility or that there was no realistic prospect of early release in practice. In this connection, the Government relied on the Court ’ s decision in Einhorn v. France (( dec. ), no. 71555/01, ECHR 2001- XI) and argued that there were clear parallels between the situation in Cyprus and that in Pennsylvania."

There was no reason to think that these provisions would never be exercised de facto. In practice, life prisoners had been released. Subsequent to the nine life prisoners released in 1993, two other life prisoners had been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in 1997 and 2005. There was no evidence in the present case indicating that in a change of circumstances in which the applicant displayed significant remorse for his crimes, which he had not done so far, and was no longer considered to represent any significant danger to society, he could not be released under the above provisions."

In particular, they noted that, at present, firstly, there was no published procedure or criteria governing the operation of Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution or section 14(1) of the Prison Law of 1996; secondly, there was no obligation to disclose to a prisoner the opinion of the Attorney-General on his application; thirdly, there was no requirement for the President to give reasons for refusing an application for early release, nor was this the practice; and, finally, refusal to order early release was not amenable to judicial review in the courts."

                "92. Furthermore, although there was no clear consensus among member States with regard to early release for lifers and the criteria to be applied in this respect, there was an increasing emphasis in the practice of some member States, in the statements issued by Council of Europe institutions and in the Court ’ s jurisprudence, on the need for fair, consistent and transparent procedures in the administration of provisions governing early release for those serving life sentences. With all the above in mind and before the present application had been lodged, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order had initiated a review of the procedures in Cyprus with a view to improving the rights of life prisoners. The Government noted that the proposals for legislative reform would be put forward at some time during 2007. They submitted a draft bill that had been prepared for the purposes of amending section 14 of the Prison Law. The proposals for amendment involved, inter alia, the fixing of a minimum period to be served to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence before a prisoner could be considered eligible for parole on licence under section 14 of the Prison Law and the establishment of an independent parole board with responsibility for assessing the risk to the public once the relevant part of the sentence had been served and with the power to direct a prisoner ’ s release on licence where the evidence indicated an acceptable level of risk. The provisions of the bill set out in detail the procedure to be followed by the board and the rights of prisoners in this matter. Nonetheless, the Government stressed that the fact that they were considering reform of the present system did not entail an acceptance that there had been a violation of the applicant ’ s Convention rights."

This was particularly so given that, in sentencing the applicant, the Limassol Assize Court had adopted the earlier judgment of the Nicosia Assize Court in the case of The Republic of Cyprus v. Yiouroukkis, casting doubts on the compatibility of the Regulations both with the Constitution and section 1 1 of the Prison Discipline Law. The Limassol Assize Court had rejected the possibility of imposing three consecutive terms and had concluded that imprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused ’ s life. The applicant had also been present at the sentencing hearing. Consequently, the applicant ’ s expectation about his future release must have been significantly qualified by that court ’ s judgment, notwithstanding the administrative form given to him shortly thereafter upon his admission to prison."

In addition, three and a half years after the applicant had been sentenced, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, thus definitively resolving the issue. So for the past fourteen years the position in domestic law had been quite clear. It could not therefore be said that the applicant had been in a state of uncertainty throughout his sentence."

The imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment on an adult offender is not in itself prohibited by or incompatible with Article 3 or any other Article of the Convention (see, inter alia, among many authorities, Kotälla v. the Netherlands, no. 79 94/77, Commission decision of 6 May 1978, Decisions and Reports ( DR ) 14, p. 238; Bamber v. the United Kingdom, no. 13183 /87, Commission decision of 14 December 1988, DR 59, p. 235; and Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 63716/00, ECHR 2001- VI ). At the same time, however, the Court has also held that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence on an adult may raise an issue under Article 3 (see, inter alia, Nivette v.

                "98. In determining whether a life sentence in a given case can be regarded as irreducible, the Court has sought to ascertain whether a life prisoner can be said to have any prospect of release. An analysis of the Court ’ s case-law on the subject discloses that where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3. The Court has held, for instance, in a number of cases that, where detention was subject to review for the purposes of parole after the expiry of the minimum term for serving the life sentence, it could not be said that the life prisoners in question had been deprived of any hope of release (see, for example, Stanford, cited above; Hill v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 19365/02, 18 March 2003; and Wynne, cited above ). The Court has found that this is the case even in the absence of a minimum term of unconditional imprisonment and even when the possibility of parole for prisoners serving a life sentence is limited ( see, for example, Einhorn, cited above, §§ 27- 28 ). It follows that a life sentence does not become “irreducible” by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible."

Norway, no. 14610/89, Commission decision of 9 July 1991, DR 71, p. 168), it is clear from the relevant case-law that the existence of a system providing for consideration of the possibility of release is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the compatibility of a particular life sentence with Article 3. In this context, however, it should be observed that a State ’ s choice of a specific criminal- justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

At the outset the Court notes that in Cyprus the offence of premeditated murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraphs 3 1 -3 3 above), which under the Criminal Code, as confirmed by the domestic courts, is tantamount to imprisonment for the rest of the convicted person ’ s life. Furthermore, it observes that Cypriot law does not provide for a minimum term for serving a life sentence or for the possibility of its remission on the basis of good conduct and industry. However, the adjustment of such a sentence is possible at any stage irrespective of the time served in prison. In particular, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution as it has been applied since 1963, the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, may suspend, remit or commute any sentence passed by a court (see paragraphs 3 6 - 3 7 above). The President can therefore at any point in time commute a life sentence to another one of a shorter duration and then remit it, affording the possibility of immediate release. Moreover, section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996 provides for the conditional release of prisoners, including life prisoners (see paragraph 59 above). In line with this provision, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the President, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, can order by decree the conditional release of a prisoner at any time."

Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Government, there are certain shortcomings in the current procedure (see paragraph 91 above). Notwithstanding, the Court does not find that life sentences in Cyprus are irreducible with no possibility of release; on the contrary, it is clear that in Cyprus such sentences are both de jure and de facto reducible. In this connection, the Court notes that from the parties ’ submissions it transpires that life prisoners have been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution. In particular, nine life prisoners were released in 1993 and another two in 1997 and 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 5 2 and 90 above and paragraph 158 below ). All of these prisoners, apart from one, had been serving mandatory life sentences. In addition, a life prisoner can benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment. Consequently, it cannot be inferred that the applicant has no possibility of release and he has not adduced evidence to warrant such an inference."

However, the Court reiterates that matters relating to early release policies including the manner of their implementation fall within the power member States have in the sphere of criminal justice and penal policy (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour, cited above, § 44 ). In this connection, the Court observes that at the present time there is not yet a clear and commonly accepted standard amongst the member States of the Council of Europe concerning life sentences and, in particular, their review and method of adjustment. Moreover, no clear tendency can be ascertained with regard to the system and procedures implemented in respect of early release."

Bearing in mind the chronology of events and, in particular, the lapse of time between them, it cannot be said that the applicant could justifiably harbour genuine expectations that he would be released in November 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that apart from the clear sentence passed by the Assize Court in 1989 the relevant changes in the domestic law happened within a period of approximately four years, that is, between 1992 and 1996, thus about six years before the release date given by the prison authorities to the applicant came around. Therefore, any feelings of hope on the part of the applicant linked to the prospect of early release must have diminished as it became clear with the changes in domestic law that he would be serving the life sentence passed on him by the Assize Court."

It had simply proceeded to impose the sentence. He had then served his sentence but had not been released when his sentence had expired on 2 November 2002.

This was irrespective of the fact that a life prisoner might, in practice, be released under the Constitution or the Prison Law of 1996. Likewise, in the case of Hadjisavvas, the Supreme Court had held that the legislature did not equate the sentence of life imprisonment to imprisonment for any time- span, either where this was imposed as a mandatory measure of punishment under section 203(2) of the Criminal Code, or where it was imposed as a discretionary measure under section 23 of the Code."

Finally, the Government noted that in the event the Court were to conclude that at the time of the commission of the offence the Regulations had operated in domestic law in such a way as to limit the maximum penalty for the offence to twenty years (as distinct from governing the manner of implementation of a penalty of life imprisonment), then the repeal of those Regulations had resulted in a retrospective increase in that maximum. It would then also be necessary to consider whether the maximum penalty prescribed by the regulations was fifteen years or twenty years. If the latter was the case then the applicant would not have been entitled to release pursuant to the requirements of Article 7 until July 2007. It had been clear under the Regulations that the maximum period a life prisoner could be required to serve was twenty years and the earliest date of release was after serving fifteen years of his sentence. Although it was administrative practice to deduct the five years at the outset of the sentence, so as to identify the earliest possible date of release, this practice was not required by the Regulations or by the enabling legislation. An administrative practice of such nature could not in the Government ’ s view constitute a substantive restriction on the maximum length of the sentence imposed by the court. The Government, however, emphasised that this was not the correct interpretation of domestic law and that the interpretation given by the Supreme Court should be followed and adopted by the Court."

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Achour, cited above, § 41). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act committed and/or omission (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, ibid., § 35, and Achour, cited above, § 54 )."

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times ( no. 1 ), § 49, and Kokkinakis, § 40, both cited above ). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni, cited above). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, and Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317-B ). The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28, and Jamil, cited above, § 31). To this end, both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a “penalty” and a measure that concerns the “execution” or “enforcement” of the “penalty”. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 (see, inter alia, Hogben, cited above; Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996, unreported; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Uttley, cited above).

The subsequent repeal of the Prison Regulations and the retroactive application of the Prison Law of 1996 brought about both an unforeseeable prolongation of his term of imprisonment to an indefinite term for the remainder of his life and a change in the conditions of his detention. On the other hand the Government submit that section 203(2) of the Criminal Code was, and still remains, the only substantive provision of domestic law prescribing the penalty of a life sentence to be imposed by the courts for premeditated murder. This was the penalty imposed by the Limassol Assize Court on the applicant.

The prison authorities were applying the Prison Regulations, made on the basis of the Prison Discipline Law (Cap. 286), under which all prisoners, including life prisoners, were eligible for remission of their sentence on the grounds of good conduct and industry. For these purposes, Regulation 2 defined life imprisonment as meaning imprisonment for twenty years (see paragraph 4 2 above). As admitted by the Government, this was understood at the time by the executive and the administrative authorities, including the prison service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment ( see paragraph 6 5 above ). The prison authorities were therefore assessing the remission of the life sentences of prisoners on the basis of twenty years ’ imprisonment.

Subsequently, on 10 March 1989 the Limassol Assize Court, when passing sentence on the applicant, relied on the findings of the Nicosia Assize Court in the above case. It accordingly sentenced the applicant to “life imprisonment” for the remainder of his life. In spite of this, when the applicant was admitted to prison to serve his sentence, he was given a written notice by the prison authorities with a conditional release date, the remission of his life sentence having been assessed on the basis that it amounted to imprisonment for a term of twenty years. It was not until 9 October 1992 in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus ( see paragraphs 19 and 50 above) that the Regulations were declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 50-51 above).

The first clarification by a domestic court in this respect was given in the Yiouroukkis case subsequent to the commission of the offence by the applicant that led to his prosecution and conviction.

The other nine prisoners had all been sentenced prior to the judgment in the case of Yiouroukkis, in which these matters of interpretation of the life sentence and validity of the Regulations had first been raised.

It added that under Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 a prisoner who had served two days of his sentence was irrevocably considered to have served three days.

                "39. In judgment no. 197/2006 of 28 February 2006 the Supreme Court set a precedent known as the “Parot doctrine”. The case concerned a terrorist member of ETA (H. Parot) who had been convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973. The plenary Criminal Division of the Supreme Court ruled that the remissions of sentence granted to prisoners were henceforth to be applied to each of the sentences imposed and not to the maximum term of thirty years provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The court’s ruling was based in particular on a literal interpretation of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 according to which that maximum term of imprisonment was not to be treated as a new sentence distinct from those imposed, or a distinct sentence resulting from those imposed, but rather as the maximum term a convicted person should spend in prison. This reasoning made a distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena ); the former referred to the sentences imposed taken individually, to which remissions of sentence should be applied, while the latter referred to the maximum term of imprisonment to be served. The Supreme Court also used a teleological argument. The relevant parts of its reasoning read as follows:",
                "“... the joint interpretation of rules one and two of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 leads us to consider that the thirty-year limit does not become a new sentence, distinct from those successively imposed on the convict, or another sentence resulting from all the previous ones, but is the maximum term of imprisonment [ máximo de cumplimiento ] a prisoner should serve in prison. The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are: (a) first, a literal analysis of the relevant provisions leads us to conclude that the Criminal Code by no means considers the maximum term of thirty years to amount to a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply, for the simple reason that it says no such thing; (b) on the contrary, the sentence [ pena ] and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served [ condena ] are two different things; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the ‘term to be served’ [ condena ], and fixes the different lengths of that maximum ‘term to be served’ [ condena ] in relation to the ‘sentences’ imposed. According to the first rule, that maximum is arrived at in one of two ways: the different sentences are served in descending order of severity until one of the two limits set by the system is attained (three times the length of the heaviest sentence imposed or, in any event, no more than thirty years); (c) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the Code, since after having served the successive sentences as mentioned, the prisoner will no longer have to discharge [i.e. serve] the remaining ones [in the prescribed order] once the sentences already served reach the maximum length, which may not exceed thirty years ...; (e) and from a teleological point of view, it would not be rational for the combination of sentences to reduce a long string of convictions to a single new sentence of thirty years, with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence would be treated, without any justification, in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences, as in the present case. Indeed, there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing one murder is punished in the same way as committing two hundred murders; (f) were application for a pardon to be made, it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served [ condena ], but rather to one, several or all of the different sentences imposed; in such a case it is for the sentencing court to decide, and not the judicial body responsible for setting the limit (the last one), which shows that the sentences are not combined into one. Besides, the first rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 explains how, in such a case, the sentences must be served successively ‘the convicted person going on to serve the next sentence when the previous one has been extinguished by pardon’; (g) lastly, from a procedural point of view section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act clearly states that it is a matter of setting the maximum limit of the sentences imposed (in the plural, in keeping with the wording of the law), ‘ fixing the maximum term to be served in respect of all the sentences ’ (the wording is very clear).",
                "Which is why the term ‘combination [ refundición ] of the sentences to be served [ condenas ]’ is very misleading and inappropriate. There is no merging of sentences into a single sentence, but the number of years an individual can be expected to serve in respect of multiple sentences is limited by law. This means that the prisoner serves the different sentences, with their respective specificities and with all the corresponding entitlements. That being so, the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 may be applied to the sentences successively served by the prisoner.",
                "The total term to be served [ condena ] is thus served in the following manner: the prisoner begins by serving the heaviest sentences imposed. The relevant adjustments [ beneficios ] and remissions are applied to each of the sentences the prisoner serves. When the first [sentence] has been completed, the prisoner begins to serve the next one, and so on until the limits provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 have been reached, at which point all of the sentences comprised in the total term to be served [ condena ] will have been extinguished.",
                "Take, for example, the case of an individual given three prison sentences: thirty years, fifteen years and ten years. The second rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... limits the maximum term to be served to three times the most serious sentence or thirty years’ imprisonment. In this case the actual term to be served would be thirty years. The prisoner would begin serving the successive sentences (the total term to be served), starting with the longest sentence (thirty years in this case). If he were granted a ten-year remission for whatever reason, he would have served that sentence after twenty years’ imprisonment, and the sentence would be extinguished; next, the prisoner would start to serve the next longest sentence (fifteen years). With five years’ remission that sentence will have been served after ten years. 20 + 10 = 30. [The prisoner] would not have to serve any other sentence, any remaining sentences ceasing to have effect, as provided for in the applicable Criminal Code, once this maximum term, which may not exceed thirty years, is attained. ”"

In the above-mentioned judgment the Supreme Court considered that there was no well-established case-law on the specific question of the interpretation of Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 in conjunction with Article 70.2.

However, the Supreme Court departed from that interpretation, pointing out that that decision was an isolated one and could therefore not be relied on as a precedent in so far as it had never been applied in a consistent manner.",

The three dissenting judges appended an opinion stating that the sentences imposed successively were transformed or joined together into another sentence, similar in nature but different in so far as it combined the various sentences into one. That sentence, which they called “the sentence to be served”, was the one resulting from the application of the limit fixed in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, which effectively extinguished the sentences that went beyond that limit. This new “unit of punishment” was the term the prisoner had to serve, to which remission for work done in detention was to be applied. Remissions would therefore affect the sentences imposed, but only once the rules on the consecutive serving of sentences had been applied to them “for the purposes of their completion”. The dissenting judges also pointed out that for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, all Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court (agreements adopted by the plenary Criminal Division on 18 July 1996 and 12 February 1999), had agreed to the principle that reductions of sentence should be applied to the sentence resulting from the application of Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (the thirty-year limit).

This new interpretation to the convicted person’s detriment was based on a policy of full execution of sentences which was alien to the Criminal Code of 1973, could be a source of inequalities and was contrary to the settled case-law of the Supreme Court (judgments of 8 March 1994, 15 September 2005 and 14 October 2005).

It explained that remissions of sentence which had already been approved had to be taken into account by the trial court required to rule on the discharge ( liquidación ) of the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), and that remissions already accrued in application of the law could not subsequently be revoked to correct any errors or permit the application of a new interpretation.

In two of those judgments (nos. 39/2012 and 57/2012), the Constitutional Court allowed the appeals, holding that there had been a violation of the right to effective judicial protection (Article 24 § 1 of the Constitution) and of the right to liberty (Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution). It considered that the new method of applying remissions of sentence as a result of the Supreme Court’s departure from its case-law in 2006 had challenged final judicial decisions concerning the interested parties. It noted that the Audiencia Nacional which had adopted the decisions in question had considered that the Criminal Code of 1973 (which provided for a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years) was more favourable to the persons concerned than the Criminal Code of 1995 (where the limit was twenty-five years) because they would have lost the right to remissions of sentence from the time the Criminal Code of 1995 entered into force had it been applied to them. Observing that the Audiencia Nacional had based its finding on the principle that the remissions of sentence provided for under the old Code should be deducted from the legal maximum term of imprisonment (namely thirty years), it held that final judicial decisions could not be altered by a new judicial decision applying another method. It concluded that there had been a violation of the right to effective judicial protection, and more specifically of the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled (the “intangibility” of final judicial decisions, or the principle of res judicata ). Concerning the right to liberty, it considered that, regard being had to the Criminal Code of 1973 and the method of applying remissions of sentence adopted in the judicial decisions cited above, the prisoners concerned had completed their sentences, which meant that their continued detention after the release date proposed by the prison authorities (in conformity with the formerly applicable rules) had no legal basis. In both decisions it referred to the Court’s judgment in Grava v. Italy (no. 43522/98, §§ 44-45, 10 July 2003)."

The Constitutional Court referred to the Court’s case-law establishing a distinction between measures constituting a “penalty” and those relating to the “execution” of a sentence for the purposes of Article 7 of the Convention ( Hogben v. the United Kingdom, no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 231; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Gurguchiani v.

                "52. In the parts of its judgment no. 39/2012 concerning the principle of legality, for example, the Constitutional Court stated:",
                "“3. ... It must first be observed that the question under examination does not fall within the scope of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution – namely the interpretation and application of criminal charges, the classification of the facts established in respect of the offences concerned and the application of the corresponding penalties ... – but rather concerns the execution of custodial sentences, that is to say the application of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, and the interpretation we are required to examine cannot lead to the serving of sentences heavier than those provided for in respect of the criminal offences concerned, or to imprisonment in excess of the legal limit. In a similar manner, contrary to what the prosecution have argued, the European Court of Human Rights also considers that, even when they have an impact on the right to liberty, measures concerning the execution of the sentence – rather than the sentence itself – do not fall within the scope of the principle of no punishment without law enshrined in Article 7 § 1 of the Convention provided that they do not result in the imposition of a penalty harsher than that provided for by law. In its judgment in the case of Grava v. Italy (§ 51) of 10 July 2003, the European Court of Human Rights reached this conclusion in a case concerning remission of sentence, citing mutatis mutandis Hogben v. the United Kingdom (no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 46, pp. 231, 242, relating to release on licence). More recently, in its judgment of 15 December 2009 in the case of Gurguchiani v. Spain (§ 31), the Court stated: ‘both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a ‘penalty’ and a measure that concerns the ‘execution’ or ‘enforcement’ of the ‘penalty’. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relate to a remission of sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the ‘penalty’ within the meaning of Article 7.’",
                "The court must also reject the complaint concerning the alleged violation of the principle of no punishment without law (Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution) as a result of the retroactive application of Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995 (in its initial wording and as amended by Organic Law no. 7/2003), authorising the sentencing judge or court to order that ‘decisions concerning adjustments of sentence, day-release permits, pre-release classification and the calculation of the time remaining to be served prior to release on licence should take into account all of the sentences imposed’ in certain situations where sentences were grouped together (Article 78 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The law obliges the courts to take into account all the sentences in cases where particularly heavy multiple sentences were imposed. There are certain exceptions to this obligation, however (Article 78 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code currently in force). That said, the impugned decisions and the Supreme Court decision cited in them did not involve any retroactive application of that rule (which in any event is not applicable to remissions of sentence for work done in detention, as the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with such remissions). They simply applied the provisions that were in force at the time the offences of which the applicant was convicted were committed (Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), but with a new interpretation which, although based on the method of calculation expressly provided for in Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995, was possible, they explained, in view of the wording of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. That being so, if one follows the reasoning of the judicial bodies and the applicable rules, the appellant’s complaint lacks any factual basis as the principle of the non-retroactive application of a harsher criminal law enshrined in Article 25 § 1 of the Constitution is breached only where a criminal law has been applied retroactively to acts committed before its entry into force ...”",
                "Concerning the right to liberty, the Constitutional Court held:",
                "“4. ... In our case-law remissions of sentence for work done in detention directly affect the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution, as the duration of the term of imprisonment depends inter alia on how they are applied, regard being had to Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 ... That provision states that ‘the prisoner shall be entitled, with the approval of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, to one day’s remission for every two days worked’, as calculated periodically by the judges responsible for the execution of sentences, based on proposals made by the prison authorities, said remission then being taken into account, for the purposes of the term of imprisonment to be served, by the sentencing court ...",
                "We have also held that remissions of sentence for work done in detention are in the spirit of Article 25 § 2 of the Constitution and the rehabilitational purpose of custodial sentences ... While it is true that Article 25 § 2 embodies no fundamental right protected by the amparo remedy, it does establish a penal and prison policy guideline for the legislature, as well as a principle regarding the interpretation of the rules on the imposition and execution of prison sentences, and both the guideline and the principle are enshrined in the Constitution ...",
                "Also, having noted that the right guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution authorises deprivation of liberty only ‘in the cases and in the manner prescribed by law’, we have found that it cannot be ruled out that the manner in which the sentence to be served is calculated may undermine that right in the event of failure to comply with the legal provisions relating to the consecutive or concurrent serving of different sentences that might have given rise to a reduction of the duration of the detention, where failure to apply the rules concerned leads to the unlawful extension of the detention and, consequently, of the deprivation of liberty ... In a similar vein the European Court of Human Rights has also found a violation of the right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5 of the Convention in a case where a prisoner served a longer sentence ‘than the sentence [he] should have served under the domestic law, taking into account the remission to which he was entitled. The additional time spent in prison accordingly amounted to unlawful detention within the meaning of the Convention’ ( Grava v. Italy, ECHR, 10 July 2003, § 45).”",
                "After having found a violation of the right to effective judicial protection, the Constitutional Court had the following to say concerning the consequences of that violation as regards the right to liberty:",
                "“8. However, we cannot limit ourselves to the mere finding of a violation [of Article 24 § 1 of the Constitution] arrived at above. We must also consider the consequences of that violation in terms of the right to liberty (Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution).",
                "Bearing in mind the binding nature of the order of 28 May 1997 adopted by the court responsible for the execution of sentences (whose role it was to determine how the sentence should be served and when it should end) and the legal situation created by the aforesaid decision in respect of the calculation of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the sentence was served for years as prescribed in the order in question: application of the former Criminal Code and the rules governing remissions of sentence for work done in detention, according to which the prisoner was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days worked, and deduction of the resulting remission, as periods of sentence discharged, from the maximum actual term of thirty years to be served following the combination of the sentences. That was confirmed by unequivocal acts by the prison authorities, who drew up charts showing provisional lengths of sentence taking into account remission for work done in detention, approved periodically by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences further to proposals by the prison authorities, and in particular one chart of 25 January 2006 which served as a basis for the proposal to release the prisoner on 29 March 2006, submitted to the judge by the prison governor.",
                "It follows that, under the legislation in force at the time of the offence, and taking into account the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as calculated according to the firm and binding criteria established by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, the appellant had already discharged the sentence he was given. That being so, and although the appellant was deprived of his liberty in a lawful manner, his deprivation of liberty fell outside the cases provided for by law once he had finished serving his sentence in the conditions outlined above, as the legal basis for his continuing detention had ceased to exist. It follows that the additional time the appellant served in prison amounted to unlawful deprivation of liberty in breach of the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 17 § 1 of the Constitution (see Grava v. Italy, ECHR 10 July 2003, §§ 44 and 45).",
                "In a State where the rule of law prevails it is unacceptable to extend a prisoner’s incarceration once he has served his sentence. The courts should accordingly take the necessary steps, as soon as possible, to put a stop to the violation of the fundamental right to liberty and arrange for the appellant’s immediate release.”"

                "53. The judgments of the Constitutional Court prompted separate opinions – concurring or dissenting – from certain judges. In the dissenting opinion she appended to judgment no. 40/2012, Judge A. Asua Batarrita stated that the fact that the new interpretation of the rule for calculating the term of imprisonment to be served had been applied while the sentence was already under way shed doubt on an established legal situation and distorted projections based on the consistent interpretation of the applicable rules. She described the arrangements for remissions of sentence introduced by the Criminal Code of 1973 and the distinction traditionally made between the “nominal duration” and the “actual duration” of the sentence, which the courts took into account when fixing sentences. She pointed out that remissions of sentence for work done in detention differed from other measures entailing adjustment of sentences, such as release on licence, and that the granting of such remissions was not left to the discretion of the courts, which were not bound by criteria such as the prisoner’s good conduct or how dangerous he or she was considered to be. The judge concluded that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were mandatory by law. She stated that, under the Criminal Code of 1973, the principle of legality should apply not only to offences but also to the punitive consequences of their commission, that is to say the nominal limit of the prison sentences and their actual limit after deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. Noting that the limits set under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the remissions of sentence for work done in detention, had effectively reduced the maximum nominal sentence (thirty years) to a shorter actual term of imprisonment (twenty years), except in the event of misconduct or attempted escape, she expressed the view that the “Parot doctrine” had established an artificial distinction between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term of imprisonment to be served” ( condena ) that had no basis in the Criminal Code, and had subjected the application of the thirty-year limit to a new condition – not provided for by Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 – according to which, during that period, the sentence was to be served “in a prison”, thereby preventing the application of the rules on remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In her view that was tantamount to imposing a nominal maximum term of forty-five years (that is, thirty years’ actual imprisonment plus fifteen years corresponding to work done in detention).",
                "She considered that neither the teleological arguments nor the criminal policy considerations underlying the “Parot doctrine” could justify such a departure from the case-law concerning the interpretation of a law – the Criminal Code of 1973 – that had been repealed over ten years earlier. In view of all these considerations she concluded that the interpretation by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 2006 had not been foreseeable and that there had been a violation of Article 25 § 1 (principle of legality), Article 17 § 1 (right to liberty) and Article 24 § 1 (right to effective judicial protection) of the Constitution."

He specified that this requirement should apply to the real and effective duration of the deprivation of liberty. Having noted that the legislation interpreted by the Supreme Court – the Criminal Code of 1973 – was no longer in force in 2006 and could therefore be brought into play only if it worked in the convicted person’s favour, he concluded that a sudden, unforeseeable departure from the case-law was incompatible with the right to liberty. He also doubted that legislation that made no explicit provision for the means of calculating remissions of sentence, and could be interpreted in two radically different ways, met the required standard of quality of the law."

It concluded that at the time when the offences had been committed and at the time when the decision to combine the sentences had been adopted (on 30 November 2000), the relevant Spanish law, taken as a whole, including the case-law, had been formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to discern to a reasonable degree the scope of the penalty imposed and the manner of its execution (see paragraph 55 of the Chamber judgment, with a reference, by contrast, to Kafkaris v.

It emphasised that the domestic courts must not, retroactively and to the detriment of the individual concerned, apply the criminal policy behind legislative changes brought in after the offence was committed (see paragraph 62 of the Chamber judgment). It concluded that it had been difficult, or even impossible, for the applicant to imagine, at the material time and also at the time when all the sentences were combined and a maximum term of imprisonment fixed, that the Supreme Court would depart from its previous case-law in 2006 and change the way remissions of sentence were applied, that this departure from case-law would be applied to her case and that the duration of her incarceration would be substantially lengthened as a result (see paragraph 63 of the Chamber judgment).",

As a result of this change of approach the thirty-year term fixed by the decision of 30 November 2000, of which she had been notified the same day, had ceased to be treated as a new, independent and/or final sentence and the various sentences imposed on her between 1988 and 2000 (totalling over 3,000 years’ imprisonment) in eight trials had, in a manner of speaking, been restored. The applicant submitted that by applying the remissions of sentence to each of her sentences individually the Spanish courts had deprived her of the remissions of sentence she had earned and added nine years to her imprisonment.

In the applicant’s submission, the Criminal Code of 1973 was ambiguous in that it did not specify whether the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment was a new, independent sentence, whether the individual sentences continued to exist once they had been combined together, and to which sentence the remissions of sentence for work done should be applied. Judgment no. 197/2006 had not clarified the question of sentencing as the Supreme Court had not expressly set aside its order of 25 May 1990 according to which the combining of sentences provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 was the means of determining the sentence.",

The present case should be distinguished from cases concerning discretionary measures of early release or measures that did not result in a redefinition of the penalty (the applicant referred to Hogben, cited above, Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996; Grava, cited above; and Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005).

The sole purpose of combining and placing an upper limit on the sentences had been to fix the duration of the actual term to be served as a result of all the sentences imposed in the different sets of proceedings.

While it was true that prior to the adoption by the Supreme Court of judgment no. 197/2006 the Spanish prisons and courts had tended, in practice, to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention to the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment, that practice did not concern the determination of the penalty, but rather its execution. Furthermore, that practice had no basis in the case-law of the Supreme Court in the absence of any established principle as to the manner of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. The sole judgment delivered on this issue by the Supreme Court in 1994 did not suffice to set an authoritative precedent under Spanish law. The Supreme Court’s case-law in the matter had not been settled until its Criminal Division had adopted judgment no. 197/2006. What is more, the Government argued, that case-law had been endorsed by the full Constitutional Court in several judgments delivered on 29 March 2012, containing numerous references to the Court’s case-law concerning the distinction between a “penalty” and its “execution”."

In the Government’s submission, the Chamber had mistakenly considered that the application of the “Parot doctrine” had deprived of all purpose the remissions of sentence for work done in detention granted to convicted prisoners under the Criminal Code of 1973. Remissions of sentence continued to be applied, but to each of the sentences individually, until the maximum term had been reached. Only in the case of the most serious crimes, such as those committed by the applicant, would the thirty-year limit be reached before the remissions of sentence granted for work done in detention had significantly reduced the sentences imposed. Similarly, the Chamber had mistakenly considered that the Supreme Court had retroactively applied the policy behind the legislative reforms of 1995 and 2003. It was plain to see that the reforms in question made no mention of the means of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the Criminal Code of 1995 having done away with them. Had the criminal policy behind the 2003 law been applied retroactively, the applicant would have been liable to a maximum term of imprisonment of forty years."

In its judgment the Chamber had departed from the Court’s case-law concerning the distinction between measures that amounted to a “penalty” and those relating to the “execution” of a penalty. Under that case-law a measure concerning remission of sentence or a change in the system of release on licence was not an integral part of the “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 (the Government referred to Grava, § 51; Uttley; Kafkaris, § 142; and Hogben, all cited above). In Kafkaris, the Court had acknowledged that a prison-law reform which was applied retroactively, excluding prisoners serving life sentences from earning remissions of sentence for work done in detention, concerned the execution of the sentence as opposed to the “penalty” imposed (§ 151). In the present case the Government submitted that there had been no change in prison law. The only effect of Supreme Court judgment no. 197/2006 concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention had been to prevent the date of the applicant’s release being brought forward nine years, not to increase the penalty imposed on her."

Germany, all cited above). The disputed measure concerned remissions of sentence or “early release”, not the maximum term that could be served in respect of the sentences imposed, which had not changed. Remissions of sentence for work done in detention did not pursue the same aims as the penalty as such, but were measures relating to its execution in so far as they allowed prisoners to be released before all their sentences had been served, provided that they demonstrated a willingness to return to the social mainstream through work or other paid activities. That being so, remissions of sentence for work done in detention could not be likened to measures imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”; instead, they were measures relating to the prisoner’s conduct while serving the sentence. In any event there was no question of any “severity” as they always benefited the prisoner concerned by bringing forward the date of release."

The Government further submitted that the Chamber judgment was inconsistent with the Court’s case-law on the question of to what extent a person should be able, when committing an offence, to predict the exact term of imprisonment he or she would incur. As remissions of sentence for work done in detention were purely a prison matter, the Supreme Court could not be criticised for having departed from previous practice with regard to the application of remissions of sentence, as the change had had no effect on the rights enshrined in Article 7. The Court had never held that the foreseeability requirement extended to the exact length of the sentence to be served taking into account sentence adjustments, remissions, pardons or any other factors affecting the execution of the sentence. Such factors were impossible to foresee and to calculate ex ante."

Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). The Chamber had considered that a single judgment given in 1994 – faulty, albeit confirmed by administrative practice – should prevail over case-law established by the Supreme Court and endorsed by the Constitutional Court, even though the latter case-law was more in keeping with the wording of the law in force at the material time.

It submitted that, in conformity with that principle, and with the aim and purpose of Article 7 prohibiting any arbitrariness in the application of the law, the autonomous concepts of “law” and “penalty” must be interpreted sufficiently broadly to preclude the surreptitious retroactive application of a criminal law or a penalty to the detriment of a convicted person. It argued that where changes to the law or the interpretation of the law affected a sentence or remission of sentence in such a way as to seriously alter the sentence in a way that was not foreseeable at the time when it was initially imposed, to the detriment of the convicted person and his or her Convention rights, those changes, by their very nature, concerned the substance of the sentence and not the procedure or arrangements for executing it, and accordingly fell within the scope of the prohibition of retroactivity. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that certain legal provisions classified at domestic level as rules governing criminal procedure or the execution of sentences had serious, unforeseeable effects detrimental to individual rights, and were by nature comparable or equivalent to a criminal law or a penalty with retroactive effect.

When that happens, the Court considers that the measures concerned should fall within the scope of the prohibition of the retroactive application of penalties enshrined in Article 7 § 1 in fine of the Convention. Otherwise, States would be free – by amending the law or reinterpreting the established regulations, for example – to adopt measures which retroactively redefined the scope of the penalty imposed, to the convicted person’s detriment, when the latter could not have imagined such a development at the time when the offence was committed or the sentence was imposed. In such conditions Article 7 § 1 would be deprived of any useful effect for convicted persons, the scope of whose sentences was changed ex post facto to their disadvantage.

There thus seems to have been a distinction between the concept of the “term to be served” ( condena ) and the individual sentences ( penas ) actually pronounced or imposed in the various judgments convicting the applicant. At the same time, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973, on remission of sentence for work done, established that in discharging the “sentence imposed” the detainee was entitled to one day’s remission for every two days’ work done (see paragraph 24 above). However, that Article contained no specific guidance on how to apply remissions of sentence when multiple sentences were combined as provided for under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code and a maximum total term of imprisonment was fixed, as in the applicant’s case, where sentences totalling 3,000 years’ imprisonment were reduced to thirty years in application of that provision. The Court observes that it was not until Article 78 of the new Criminal Code of 1995 was introduced that the law expressly stated, with regard to the application of sentence adjustments, that in exceptional cases the total duration of the sentences imposed could be taken into account, rather than the maximum term provided for by law (see paragraph 32 above)."

The prison and judicial authorities thus took into account the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment when applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In a judgment of 8 March 1994 (its first ruling on this question – see paragraph 36 above), the Supreme Court referred to the maximum legal term of thirty years’ imprisonment as a “new, independent sentence” to which the possibilities of adjustment provided for by law, such as release on licence and remission of sentence, should be applied. The Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court, took the same approach when comparing the sentences to be served respectively under the Criminal Code of 1995 and the previous Code, taking into account any remissions of sentence already granted under the previous Code, in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law (see paragraphs 37, 41 and 48 above). Lastly, until the Supreme Court’s judgment no. 197/2006 this approach was applied to numerous prisoners convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973, whose remissions for work done in detention were deducted from the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 41 above)."

Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that in spite of the ambiguity of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973 and the fact that the Supreme Court did not set about clarifying them until 1994, it was clearly the practice of the Spanish prison and judicial authorities to treat the term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ), that is to say the thirty-year maximum term of imprisonment provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, as a new, independent sentence to which certain adjustments, such as remissions of sentence for work done in detention, should be applied."

That being so, while she was serving her prison sentence – and in particular after the Audiencia Nacional decided on 30 November 2000 to combine her sentences and fix a maximum term of imprisonment – the applicant had every reason to believe that the penalty imposed was the thirty-year maximum term, from which any remissions of sentence for work done in detention would be deducted. Indeed, in its last judgment convicting the applicant, on 8 May 2000, delivered before the decision to combine the sentences was taken, the Audiencia Nacional took into account the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the same Code, in determining which Criminal Code – the one in force at the material time or the Criminal Code of 1995 – was the more favourable to the applicant (see paragraph 11 above). In these circumstances, contrary to what the Government have suggested, the fact that the applicant did not challenge the decision of the Audiencia Nacional of 15 February 2001 fixing the date on which she would have finished serving her sentence ( liquidación de condena ) at 27 June 2017 is not decisive, as that decision did not take into account the remissions of sentence already earned and was therefore unrelated to the question of how remissions of sentence should be applied."

                "101. The Court further notes that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were expressly provided for by statutory law (Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), and not by regulations (compare Kafkaris, cited above). Moreover, it was in the same Code that the sentences were prescribed and the remissions of sentence were provided for. The Court also notes that such remissions of sentence gave rise to substantial reductions of the term to be served – up to a third of the total sentence – unlike release on licence, which simply provided for improved or more lenient conditions of execution of the sentence (see, for example, Hogben and Uttley, both cited above; see also the dissenting opinion of Judge A. Asua Batarrita appended to judgment no. 40/2012 of the Constitutional Court, paragraph 53 above). After deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention periodically approved by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( Juez de Vigilancia Penitenciaria ), the sentence was fully and finally discharged on the date of release approved by the sentencing court. Furthermore, unlike other measures that affected the execution of the sentence, the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not subject to the discretion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences: the latter’s task was to fix the remissions of sentence by simply applying the law, on the basis of proposals made by the prison authorities, without considering such criteria as how dangerous the prisoner was considered to be, or his or her prospects of reintegration (see paragraph 53 above; compare Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, §§ 98-99, ECHR 2012, and Macedo da Costa v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 26619/07, 5 June 2012). It should be noted in this connection that Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 provided for the automatic reduction of the term of imprisonment for work done in detention, except in two specific cases: when the prisoner escaped or attempted to escape, and when the prisoner misbehaved (which, according to Article 65 of the 1956 Prison Regulations, meant committing two or more serious or very serious breaches of discipline; see paragraph 26 above). Even in these two cases, remissions of sentence already allowed by the judge could not be taken away retroactively, as days of remission of sentence already granted were deemed to have been served and formed part of the prisoner’s legally acquired rights (see paragraphs 26 and 45 above). The present case should be distinguished in this respect from Kafkaris, where the five years’ remission of sentence granted to life prisoners at the beginning of their incarceration was conditional on their good conduct (see Kafkaris, cited above, §§ 16 and 65)."

The Court also considers it significant that, although the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with remissions of sentence for work done in detention for people convicted in the future, its transitional provisions authorised prisoners convicted under the old Criminal Code of 1973 – like the applicant – to continue to enjoy the benefits of the scheme if it was to their advantage (see paragraph 30 above). Law no. 7/2003, on the other hand, introduced harsher conditions of release on licence, even for prisoners convicted before its entry into force (see paragraph 34 above). The Court infers from this that in opting, as a transitional measure, to maintain the effects of the rules concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention and for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law, the Spanish legislature considered those rules to be part of substantive criminal law, that is to say of the provisions which affected the actual fixing of the sentence, not just its execution."

Relying on the “Parot doctrine” established in judgment no. 197/2006, given by the Supreme Court on 28 February 2006 – well after the offences had been committed, the sentences combined and a maximum term of imprisonment fixed – the Audiencia Nacional moved the date back to 27 June 2017 (see paragraph 20 above). The Court notes that in judgment no. 197/2006, the Supreme Court departed from the interpretation it had adopted in a previous judgment of 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The majority of the Supreme Court considered that the new rule by which remissions of sentence for work done in detention were to be applied to each of the individual sentences – rather than to the thirty-year maximum term as previously – was more in conformity with the actual wording of the provisions of the 1973 Criminal Code, which distinguished between the “sentence” ( pena ) and the “term to be served” ( condena )."

As determined by the prison authorities, the duration of these remissions of sentence – 3,282 days in all – was accepted by all the courts which handled the case. For example, in its decision applying the Supreme Court’s “Parot doctrine”, the Audiencia Nacional did not change the quantum of the remissions of sentence granted to the applicant for work done in detention. The decision did not concern whether she deserved the remissions, for example in view of her conduct or circumstances relating to the execution of her sentence. The aim of the decision was to determine the element of the penalty to which the remissions of sentence should be applied."

In other words, the applicant was initially sentenced to a number of lengthy terms of imprisonment, which were combined and limited to an effective term of thirty years, on which the remissions of sentence to which she was meant to be entitled had no effect whatsoever.

This measure taken by the court that convicted the applicant also led to the redefinition of the scope of the “penalty” imposed. As a result of the “Parot doctrine”, the maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment ceased to be an independent sentence to which remissions of sentence for work done in detention were applied, and instead became a thirty-year sentence to which no such remissions would effectively be applied."

            [
                "112. This change in the system for applying remissions of sentence was the result of the Supreme Court’s departure from previous case-law, as opposed to a change in legislation. That being so, it remains to be determined whether the new interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973, long after the offences were committed and the applicant convicted – and even after the decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – was reasonably foreseeable for the applicant, that is to say whether it could be considered to reflect a perceptible line of case-law development (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, § 43, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, § 41, both cited above). To establish that, the Court must examine whether the applicant could have foreseen at the time of her conviction, and also when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment – if need be, after taking appropriate legal advice – that the penalty imposed might turn into thirty years of actual imprisonment, with no reduction for the remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973.",
                "In so doing it must have regard to the law applicable at the time, and in particular the judicial and administrative practice prior to the “Parot doctrine” introduced by the Supreme Court’s judgment of 28 February 2006. The Court observes in this connection that the only relevant precedent cited in that judgment was a judgment of 8 March 1994 in which the Supreme Court had taken the opposite approach, namely that the maximum prison term of thirty years was a “new, independent sentence” to which all the remissions of sentence provided for by law were to be applied (see paragraph 36 above). In the Court’s view, the fact that a single judgment does not serve as an authority under Spanish law (see paragraph 40 above) cannot be decisive. What is more, as the dissenting judges observed in the judgment of 28 February 2006, an agreement adopted by the plenary Supreme Court on 18 July 1996 had established that remissions of sentence granted under the Criminal Code of 1973 were to be taken into account when comparing the sentences to be served under the new and the old Criminal Codes respectively (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above). Following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, the Spanish courts were required to use this criterion, on a case-by-case basis, to determine which Criminal Code was the more lenient, taking into account the effects on sentencing of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention."

In acting thus the Supreme Court gave a new interpretation of the provisions of a law that was no longer in force, namely the Criminal Code of 1973, which had been superseded by the Criminal Code of 1995. In addition, as indicated above (see paragraph 102), the transitional provisions of the Criminal Code of 1995 were intended to maintain the effects of the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention set in place by the Criminal Code of 1973 in respect of people convicted under that Code – like the applicant – precisely so as to comply with the rules prohibiting retroactive application of the more stringent criminal law. However, the Supreme Court’s new interpretation, which rendered ineffective any remissions of sentence already granted, led in practice to the applicant and other people in similar situations being deprived of the benefits of the remission system."

Moreover, the Court cannot accept the Government’s argument that the Supreme Court’s interpretation was foreseeable because it was more in keeping with the letter of the Criminal Code of 1973. The Court reiterates that its task is not to determine how the provisions of that Code should be interpreted in the domestic law, but rather to examine whether the new interpretation was reasonably foreseeable for the applicant under the “law” applicable at the material time. That “law” – in the substantive sense in which the term is used in the Convention, which includes unwritten law or case-law – had been applied consistently by the prison and judicial authorities for many years, until the “Parot doctrine” set a new course. Unlike the judicial interpretations involved in S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom (both cited above), the departure from case-law in the present case did not amount to an interpretation of criminal law pursuing a perceptible line of case-law development."

While the Court accepts that the Supreme Court did not retroactively apply Law no. 7/2003 amending the Criminal Code of 1995, it is clear from the reasoning given by the Supreme Court that its aim was the same as that of the above-mentioned law, namely to guarantee the full and effective execution of the maximum legal term of imprisonment by people serving several long sentences (see paragraph 33 above). In this connection, while the Court accepts that the States are free to determine their own criminal policy, for example by increasing the penalties applicable to criminal offences (see Achour, cited above, § 44), they must comply with the requirements of Article 7 in doing so ( Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 75, ECHR 2013).

Germany, cited above, § 86). Article 5 § 1 (a) permits “the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court”. Having regard to the French text, the word “conviction”, for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (a), has to be understood as signifying both a finding of guilt after it has been established in accordance with the law that there has been an offence (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, § 100, Series A no. 39), and the imposition of a penalty or other measure involving deprivation of liberty (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24 June 1982, § 35, Series A no. 50)."

            [
                "124. Furthermore, the word “after” in sub-paragraph (a) does not simply mean that the detention must follow the “conviction” in point of time: in addition, the “detention” must result from, “follow and depend upon” or occur “by virtue of” the “conviction”. In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the two (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Kafkaris, cited above, § 117; and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 88). However, with the passage of time the link between the initial conviction and the extension of the deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, § 40). The causal link required under sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release, or to redetain a person, was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court, or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. Where that was the case a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (see Weeks, cited above, § 49, and Grosskopf v. Germany, no. 24478/03, § 44, 21 October 2010)."

It is well established in the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 that all deprivation of liberty must not only be based on one of the exceptions listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) but must also be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 116, and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90). The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III; M. v. Germany, cited above, § 90; and Oshurko v. Ukraine, no. 33108/05, § 98, 8 September 2011).

In application of the Criminal Code in force at the time when the offences were committed, the applicant was given prison sentences totalling over 3,000 years (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In most of those judgments, as well as in its decision of 30 November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, the Audiencia Nacional indicated that the applicant was to serve a maximum term of thirty years’ imprisonment in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The Court notes that the applicant’s detention has not yet attained that maximum term. There is clearly a causal link between the applicant’s convictions and her continuing detention after 2 July 2008, which resulted respectively from the guilty verdicts and the maximum thirty-year term of imprisonment fixed on 30 November 2000 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris, § 120)."

Compliance with the foreseeability requirement must be examined with regard to the “law” in force at the time of the initial conviction and throughout the subsequent period of detention. In the light of the considerations that led it to find a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, the Court considers that at the time when the applicant was convicted, when she worked in detention and when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, she could not have foreseen to a reasonable degree that the method used to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention would change as a result of a departure from case-law by the Supreme Court in 2006, and that the new approach would be applied to her."

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, § 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.

Thus, had it not been for the amendment of Article 67d of the Criminal Code in 1998 (see paragraph 25 above), which was declared applicable also to preventive detention orders which had been made – as had the order against the applicant – prior to the entry into force of that amended provision (section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code; see paragraph 25 above), the applicant would have been released when ten years of preventive detention had expired, irrespective of whether he was still considered dangerous to the public."

The applicant's potential further offences were not sufficiently concrete and specific, as required by the Court's case-law, as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims, and do not, therefore, fall within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c) (compare, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Germany, cited above, § 102). Nor is the Court satisfied that the domestic courts, which were called upon to determine whether the applicant was liable to reoffend owing to his criminal tendencies, based their decision to retain the applicant in preventive detention, executed in prison, on the ground that he suffered from a serious mental disorder and was thus “of unsound mind” within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1."

The Court is aware of the fact that the domestic courts ordered the applicant's preventive detention beyond a period of ten years because they considered that there was still a risk that the applicant might commit serious sexual offences, in particular rape, if released. They thus acted in order to protect potential victims from physical and psychological harm amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment which might be caused by the applicant. Under the Court's well-established case-law, States are indeed required under Article 3 to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI; M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, § § 149 -150, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII; and Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 159, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... ). These measures should provide effective protection and include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see, inter alia, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 109, 10 October 2002; compare also, in the context of Article 2, Mastromatteo v.

In other words, the Convention obliges State authorities to take reasonable steps within the scope of their powers to prevent ill ‑ treatment of which they had or ought to have had knowledge, but it does not permit a State to protect individuals from criminal acts of a person by measures which are in breach of that person's Convention rights, in particular the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article 5 § 1."

                "“118. Article 7 embodies, inter alia, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused's disadvantage (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260 ‑ A ) or extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy (see Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005, and Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ). ...",
                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ).

At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 24 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 25 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant's continued preventive detention beyond the ten ‑ year point.

                "17. On the last point, the Constitutional Court observed that citizenship could be granted by way of exception only to persons who had never been Lithuanian citizens. It noted in that connection that J. B. , a Russian citizen by birth from a Soviet military family, had acquired Lithuanian citizenship under the Citizenship Act of 3 November 1989, by which citizenship could be granted, inter alia, to persons who on that date had had their permanent residence and permanent place of work or source of income in Lithuania. In 1994 the Constitutional Court had ruled that “soldiers of the Soviet Union who previously served in the Soviet occupying military forces unlawfully stationed in the territory of Lithuania [ could ] not be regarded as permanently residing and working in Lithuania ”. On 4 November 1999 the Citizenship Commission (established in 1998 under section 4 of the 1995 Implementing Act for the Citizenship Act) had found that J. B .'s status was unlawful, since he had served in the Soviet armed forces. It had nevertheless recommended that his status be regularised in accordance with the above - mentioned section 4, by which exceptions could be made for persons who had acquired citizenship in good faith before 31 December 1993 on that unlawful ground. On 11 November 1999 the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had followed that recommendation. However, in 2000 J. B. had applied for Russian citizenship, which he had been granted in June 2002; on 18 March 2003 he had been issued with a Russian passport, thereby losing his Lithuanian citizenship. The Constitutional Court observed that the applicant had signed Decree no. 40 on 11 April 2003 even though the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior had reminded him the day before that J. B. had previously lost his Lithuanian citizenship."

The Constitutional Court held that, as a result, Decree no. 40 was also in breach of Article 84 § 21 of the Constitution – which provides that the President is to grant citizenship in accordance with the procedure established by law – and the constitutional principle of the rule of law."

            [
                "19. The Constitutional Court went on to note that, although the Lithuanian authorities had already made an exception in his favour by regularising his status in 1999, J. B. had acquired Russian citizenship in 2000. This showed that “citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania was of less value to [J.B.] than citizenship of the Russian Federation ”. The Constitutional Court further noted that the Director of the State Security Department had informed the applicant, prior to 11 April 2003, that an investigation was being carried out into J. B .'s activities as director of an aviation company and, on 17 March 2003, that J. B. had threatened to disseminate information discrediting the applicant if the latter failed to keep his promise to appoint him as an adviser. In the Constitutional Court's view, the applicant had knowingly ignored these circumstances, although they were of crucial importance in deciding whether or not to grant citizenship to J. B. by way of exception. Having regard also to the fact that J. B. had made a significant financial contribution to the applicant's election campaign, it concluded that the decision to grant him citizenship had been “ determined not by any merit rendering [J. B. ] worthy of becoming a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania, but by his significant assistance by financial and other means to [the applicant's ] election campaign in 2002 ”. Thus, “the granting of citizenship to [J. B. ] by way of exception was nothing but a reward by the President of the Republic R. Paksas to [J. B. ] for the aforesaid support ”; consequently, in issuing Decree no. 40, the President had heeded “ neither the Constitution ... nor the law, nor the interests of the people and the State, but purely his own interests ”. The court therefore concluded that the applicant had “ afforded [J. B. ] exceptional treatment and knowingly disregarded the fundamental principles enshrined in Article 29 § 1 and Article 82 § 1 of the Constitution respectively, whereby all persons are equal before State institutions or officials, and the President of the Republic must be equally just to all”."

Had his candidacy been refused, it would have been open to him to apply to the administrative courts, which could then have requested the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of the Seimas Elections Act as amended on 15 July 2004. The Government further noted that, as President of Lithuania, the applicant could have applied to the Constitutional Court, under section 61 of the Constitutional Court Act, for an interpretation of its ruling of 11 May 1999, in which it had held that the constitutional sanction imposed in the context of impeachment proceedings was “ of an irreversible nature ”, and asked it to clarify whether this meant lifelong disqualification from standing for election. He would then have had the option of resigning in order to avoid that outcome.

He added that an application to the Constitutional Court under section 61 of the Constitutional Court Act for an interpretation of the ruling of 11 May 1999 would have been ineffective, seeing that the meaning of the phrase “of an irreversible nature” was not open to doubt.

The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 35 § 1 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to it. Thus, the complaint to be submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. Nevertheless, the only remedies that must be exhausted are those that are effective and capable of redressing the alleged violation ( see, among many other authorities, Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports 1996 ‑ II ). More specifically, the only remedies which Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient; the existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness ( see, for example, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 75, ECHR 1999-V). It falls to the respondent State, if it pleads non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, to establish that these various conditions are satisfied ( see, among other authorities, Johnston and Others v.

It follows from Article 107 of the Lithuanian Constitution that decisions of the Constitutional Court have statutory force and are final. Furthermore, as the Government pointed out in their written observations, the Constitutional Court itself is bound by its own precedents. An appeal against a refusal to register the applicant as a candidate for election to the Seimas would therefore have been bound to fail. Indeed, the Supreme Administrative Court's decision of 28 May 2004 provides an illustration of this point, since it attached decisive weight to the Constitutional Court's conclusions of 25 May 2004 in dismissing the applicant's complaint against the refusal of the Central Electoral Committee to register him as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election."

Such a request could not, however, have prompted an examination of the applicant's particular situation for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It would also have required him to resign voluntarily as President and thereby to accept such a restrictive condition that the remedy in question could not in any event be regarded as “accessible”.

Admittedly, it might at first sight have appeared conceivable for the applicant to attempt to register as a candidate in parliamentary elections after his removal from office and, once his registration was refused, to apply to the administrative courts on the basis of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. However, as noted above, in view of the Constitutional Court's ruling of 25 May 2004, such a remedy would have been ineffective in the present case, and an applicant cannot be required to avail himself of a remedy lacking effectiveness ( see paragraph 7 6 above )."

It therefore appears that the applicant's complaint does not concern an act occurring at a given point in time or even the enduring effects of such an act, but rather the Constitutional Court's ruling of 25 May 2004 that a person removed from office as President for a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath can never again be elected as a member of the Seimas ( among other positions ), and the Act of 15 July 2004 amending the Seimas Elections Act accordingly. He is therefore complaining of provisions giving rise to a continuing state of affairs, against which no domestic remedy is in fact available to him. However, as the European Commission of Human Rights noted in the De Becker v. Belgium decision (9 June 1958, no. 214/56, Yearbook 2), the existence of the six-month period specified in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question. Although this represents a “legitimate concern for order, stability and peace”, it cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the consideration of a permanent state of affairs which is not a thing of the past but still continues without any domestic remedy being available to the applicant; since there is no justification for the application of the rule, there can be no question of his being debarred by lapse of time. The Commission added that accordingly, “when [it] receives an application concerning a legal provision which gives rise to a permanent state of affairs for which there is no domestic remedy, the problem of the six months period specified in Article 26 [ of the Convention ( current Article 35 § 1)] can arise only after this state of affairs has ceased to exist; ... in the circumstances, it is exactly as though the alleged violation was being repeated daily, thus preventing the running of the six months period”. The Court itself has subsequently applied this principle. Thus, it has considered the merits of a number of applications which concerned statutory provisions that had not given rise to individual decisions against the applicants but had produced a permanent state of affairs, and which had been lodged more than six months after the entry into force of the provisions in question ( see, for example, Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005-IX, and Sejdić and Finci v.

It based that conclusion on the observation that the main content and general tenor of the applicant's book, and thus its aim, were markedly revisionist and therefore ran counter to the fundamental values of the Convention and of democracy, namely justice and peace, and inferred from that observation that he had attempted to deflect Article 10 from its real purpose by using his right to freedom of expression for ends which were contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention ( see also Witzsch v. Germany (dec.), no. 4785/03, 13 December 2005 ). The Court reached the same conclusion in, for example, Norwood ( (dec.), cited above ) and Pavel Ivanov v. Russia ( ( dec .), no. 35222/04, 20 February 2007 ), which concerned the use of freedom of expression for Islamophobic and anti-Semitic purposes respectively. In Orban and Others v. France (no. 20985/05, § 35, 15 January 2005 ) it noted that statements pursuing the unequivocal aim of justifying war crimes such as torture or summary executions likewise amounted to deflecting Article 10 from its real purpose. In the same vein, the Court has held that Article 17 of the Convention prevented the founders of an association whose memorandum of association had anti-Semitic connotations from relying on the right to freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention to challenge its prohibition, noting in particular that the applicants were essentially seeking to employ that Article as a basis under the Convention for a right to engage in activities contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention ( see W.P. and Others, cited above )."

They also emphasised that the conclusions reached by the Constitutional Court in the present case had not been unforeseeable, in particular given that, in a ruling of 11 March 1999 ( see paragraph 50 above ), that court had stressed that the constitutional sanction resulting from removal from office was irreversible; its ruling of 25 May 2004 had thus been consistent with its previous case-law."

Furthermore, relying on Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC] (no. 58278/00, §§ 100 and 103, ECHR 2006-IV), they highlighted the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in this sphere and also, referring to the concept of a “ democracy capable of defending itself”, the need to take account of the evolution of the political context in which the measure in issue had been taken; features unacceptable in the context of one country's system could be justified in another system. On that point, they stressed that Lithuania had been a democracy only between 1918 and 1940 and after 1990; accordingly, it did not have a long -standing democratic tradition, society had not completely rid itself of the “remnants of the totalitarian occupying regime” – including corruption and a lack of public trust in State institutions – and there were numerous examples of inappropriate and unethical conduct in politics. Lithuania's political, historical, cultural and constitutional situation therefore justified the measure in question, even though it might appear excessive in a well-established democracy. That position was all the more compelling in this instance since the head of State was the institution to which the nation had entrusted the duties of protecting and defending the constitutional order and democracy. Lastly, the lack of a European consensus in this area served to confirm that in deciding that persons dismissed following impeachment proceedings should be permanently disqualified from elected office, Lithuania remained within its margin of appreciation."

They noted in that connection that two institutions were involved in impeachment proceedings, namely the Seimas and the Constitutional Court; only the former could initiate them, and only the latter could rule on whether there had been a violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath. Only if the Constitutional Court had established such a violation could the Seimas remove the person concerned from office ( and, moreover, this required a three-fifths majority of all members of the Seimas ). They also pointed out that impeachment proceedings were judicial in nature, that the rules of criminal procedure applied, that in such proceedings the Seimas was presided over not by one of its members but by a member of the Supreme Court, and that the decision included reasons and was taken following an objective public investigation into the circumstances of the case. In the instant case, moreover, the applicant had had the opportunity to escape “full” constitutional liability by resigning after the Constitutional Court's opinion of 31 March 2004; he would thereby have avoided being removed from office and the resulting disqualification from standing for election."

Noting in that connection that in the Ždanoka case the Chamber (judgment of 17 June 2004) had found a violation of that Article for that reason, he argued that since the authoritative nature of the Constitutional Court's rulings meant that his disqualification was permanent, a finding along similar lines was all the more compelling in his case. Although he nonetheless conceded that the European Commission of Human Rights had reached the opposite conclusion in several cases, he pointed out that all those cases had concerned persons found guilty of particularly serious offences such as war crimes or acts of high treason, whereas he had not been convicted of any criminal offence on account of the acts forming the basis of his disqualification from standing for election.",

The margin in this area is wide, seeing that there are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision ( see Hirst, cited above, § 61, and Ždanoka, loc. cit. ).",

Proceeding in the same manner in the instant case, the Court notes at the outset that the applicant, as a former President of Lithuania removed from office following impeachment proceedings, belongs to a category of persons directly affected by the rule set forth in the Constitutional Court's ruling of 25 May 2004 and the Act of 15 July 2004. Since he has thereby been deprived of any possibility of running as a parliamentary candidate, he is entitled to claim that there has been interference with the exercise of his right to stand for election."

It reiterates, however, that under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 it is only required to examine the applicant's inability to stand for election to the Seimas. In any event, in so far as the rule in question entails ineligibility for parliamentary office, it was not applied retrospectively in the applicant's case. In fact, the first parliamentary elections in which he was barred from standing were held in October 2004, long after the above-mentioned ruling and legislative enactment."

As to the aim pursued, given that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not contain a list of “legitimate aims” capable of justifying restrictions on the exercise of the rights it guarantees and does not refer to those enumerated in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, the Contracting States are free to rely on an aim not mentioned in those Articles, provided that it is compatible with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention ( see, for example, Ždanoka, cited above, § 115).",
                "The Court accepts that this is the position in the present case. The prohibition imposed on the applicant is the consequence of his removal from office following impeachment proceedings, the purpose of which, according to the Statute of the Seimas, is to determine the constitutional liability of the highest- ranking State officials for acts carried out while in office which undermine the authorities'credibility. The measure thus forms part, according to the reasons given in the Constitutional Court's ruling of 24 May 2004, of a self-protection mechanism for democracy through “ public and democratic scrutiny ” of those holding public office, and pursues the aim of excluding from the legislature any senior officials who, in particular, have committed gross violations of the Constitution or breached their constitutional oath. As the Government submitted, the measure is thus intended to preserve the democratic order, which constitutes a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 ( see, for example, Ždanoka, cited above, § 118)."

                "101. In assessing the proportionality of the interference, it should above all be emphasised that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not exclude the possibility of imposing restrictions on the electoral rights of a person who has, for example, seriously abused a public position or whose conduct has threatened to undermine the rule of law or democratic foundations ( see, for example, Ždanoka, cited above, § 110). The present case concerns circumstances of this kind. In the context of impeachment proceedings, the Constitutional Court held that by having, while in office as President, unlawfully and for his own personal ends granted Lithuanian citizenship to J.B., disclosed a State secret to the latter by informing him that he was under investigation by the secret services, and exploited his own status to exert undue influence on a private company for the benefit of close acquaintances, the applicant had committed a gross violation of the Constitution and breached his constitutional oath. On the basis of that finding, the Seimas removed the applicant from office, his inability to serve as a member of parliament being a consequence of that decision."

Furthermore, as the Court observed above, the categories of persons affected by the disqualification are very clearly defined in law, and as a former President removed from office following impeachment proceedings for a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath, there is no doubt whatsoever that the applicant belongs to that group. Indeed, that has never been in dispute. There is therefore a clear link between the applicant's disqualification from elected office and his conduct and situation. As a result, the fact that his disqualification was not based on a specific court decision following a review of its proportionality in the individual circumstances of his case is not decisive ( see, for example, Hirst, cited above, § 71; Ždanoka, cited above, §§ 113 ‑ 14, 115 ( d) and 128; and Ādamsons, cited above, §§ 124-25 ), especially since the finding that he had committed a violation of the Constitution and breached his constitutional oath was made by the Constitutional Court, which offers the guarantees of a judicial body.",
                "More broadly, the Court observes that in the context of impeachment proceedings, following which a senior State official may be removed from office and barred from standing for election, domestic law provides for a number of safeguards protecting the persons concerned from arbitrary treatment. Firstly, it appears from the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Statute of the Seimas that the rules of criminal procedure and fair- trial principles apply in impeachment proceedings (see paragraphs 46 and 50 above). In addition, while the decision to initiate such proceedings on account of a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath and the final decision to remove a senior official from office are the prerogative of a political body, namely the Seimas, it is the task of a judicial body, namely the Constitutional Court, to rule on whether there has been a violation of the Constitution; if the court finds no such violation, the Seimas cannot remove the official from office. Furthermore, when sitting in impeachment proceedings the Seimas is presided over not by one of its members but by a judge of the Supreme Court, and it cannot remove a person from office other than by a three-fifths majority of its members in a reasoned decision. Lastly, in the specific circumstances of the present case the Court observes that the applicant, assisted by counsel, gave evidence to the Seimas and the Constitutional Court at public hearings."

Be that as it may, the Court, while not wishing either to underplay the seriousness of the applicant's alleged conduct in relation to his constitutional obligations or to question the principle of his removal from office as President, notes the extent of the consequences of his removal for the exercise of his rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1; as positive constitutional law currently stands, he is permanently and irreversibly deprived of the opportunity to stand for election to Parliament. This appears all the more severe since removal from office has the effect of barring the applicant not only from being a member of parliament but also from holding any other office for which it is necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution ( see paragraph 34 above )."

                "104. Admittedly, the Government contended that in assessing proportionality in the present case, regard should be had to the evolution of the local political context in which the principle of disqualification from elected office was applied. The Court does not disagree. It takes note in this connection of the Government's argument that, in a recent democracy such as (according to the Government) Lithuania, it is not unreasonable that the State should consider it necessary to reinforce the scrutiny carried out by the electorate through strict legal principles, such as the one in issue here, namely permanent and irreversible disqualification from standing in parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, the decision to bar a senior official who has proved unfit for office from ever being a member of parliament in future is above all a matter for voters, who have the opportunity to choose at the polls whether to renew their trust in the person concerned. Indeed, this is apparent from the wording of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which refers to “ the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.",
                "Still, as the Government suggested, the particular responsibilities of the President of Lithuania should not be overlooked. An “ institution ” in himself and the “personification” of the State, the President carries the burden of being expected to set an example, and his place in the Lithuanian institutional system is far from merely symbolic. In particular, he enjoys significant prerogatives in the legislative process since he has the right to initiate legislation (Article 68 of the Constitution) and the possibility, when a law is submitted to him for signature and promulgation, of sending it back to the Seimas for reconsideration ( Article 71 of the Constitution ). In the Court's view, it is understandable that a State should consider a gross violation of the Constitution or a breach of the constitutional oath to be a particularly serious matter requiring firm action when committed by a person holding that office."

Indeed, in the majority of the Council of Europe's member States with a republican system where impeachment proceedings may be brought against the head of State, impeachment has no direct effects on the electoral rights of the person concerned. In the other States in this category, there is either no direct effect on the exercise of the right to stand in parliamentary elections, or the permissible restrictions require a specific judicial decision and are subject to a time-limit ( see paragraph 6 2 above )."

                "107. The Court further observes that the circumstances of the present case differ greatly from those of the Ždanoka case, to which the Government referred. The central issue in that case was a statutory provision barring persons who, like the applicant, had “actively participated after 13 January 1991 ” in the Communist Party of Latvia ( CPL ) from standing in parliamentary elections. The provision had been enacted by Parliament on account of the fact that, shortly after the Declaration of Independence of 4 May 1990, the party in question had been involved in organising and conducting attempted coups in January and August 1991 against the newly formed democratic regime. After observing in particular that, in the historical and political context in which the impugned measure had been taken, it had been reasonable for the legislature to presume that the leading figures of the CPL held an anti-democratic stance, the Court concluded that there had been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It held in particular that while such a measure could not be accepted in the context, for example, of a country with a long- established framework of democratic institutions, it might be considered acceptable in Latvia in view of the historical and political context which had led to its adoption, and given the threat to the new democratic order posed by the resurgence of ideas which, if allowed to gain ground, might appear capable of restoring a totalitarian regime ( see Ždanoka, cited above, § § 132-36; see also Ādamsons, cited above, § 113 ). However, besides the obvious contextual differences between that case and the present one, the Court, without wishing to underplay the seriousness of the applicant's alleged conduct in relation to his constitutional obligations, observes that the importance of his disqualification for the preservation of the democratic order in Lithuania is not comparable."

            [
                "108. The Court also notes that, in finding no violation in the Ždanoka case, it attached considerable weight to the fact that, firstly, the Latvian parliament periodically reviewed the provision in issue and, secondly, the Constitutional Court had observed that a time-limit should be set on the restriction. It further concluded that the Latvian Parliament should keep the restriction under constant review, with a view to bringing it to an early end, and added that such a conclusion was all the more justified in view of the greater stability which Latvia now enjoyed, inter alia by reason of its full European integration, indicating that any failure by the Latvian legislature to take active steps to that end might result in a different finding by the Court ( see Ždanoka, loc.cit. )."

Thus, in assessing the proportionality of such a general measure restricting the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, decisive weight should be attached to the existence of a time-limit and the possibility of reviewing the measure in question. The need for such a possibility is, moreover, linked to the fact that, as the Government noted, the assessment of this issue must have regard to the historical and political context in the State concerned; since this context will undoubtedly evolve, not least in terms of the perceptions which voters may have of the circumstances that led to the introduction of such a general restriction, the initial justification for the restriction may subside with the passing of time."

                "In this connection it notes in particular that the second paragraph of Article 56 of the Constitution, which specifies the persons who cannot be elected as members of the Seimas, makes no reference to persons who have been removed from office following impeachment proceedings. When the Seimas decided to remove the applicant from office as President (on 6 April 2004), no legal provision stated that he was to be barred from standing for election as a result. Accordingly, when he informed the Central Electoral Committee of his intention to stand in the presidential election called for 13 June 2004 following his removal from office, the committee initially found (on 22 April 2004) that there was nothing to prevent him from doing so. The Seimas then introduced an amendment to the Presidential Elections Act to the effect that anyone who had been removed from office following impeachment proceedings could not be elected President until a period of five years had elapsed, as a result of which the committee ultimately refused to register the applicant as a candidate. Further to an action brought by members of the Seimas, the Constitutional Court held (on 25 May 2004) that such disqualification was compatible with the Constitution but that subjecting it to a time-limit was unconstitutional, adding that it applied to any office for which it was necessary to take an oath in accordance with the Constitution. The Seimas subsequently (on 15 July 2004) introduced an amendment to the Seimas Elections Act to the effect that anyone who had been removed from office following impeachment proceedings was ineligible to be a member of parliament.",
                "The striking rapidity of the legislative process reinforces the impression that it was at least triggered by the specific desire to bar the applicant from standing in the presidential election called as a result of his removal from office. That, admittedly, is not a decisive factor for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which applies only to the election of the legislature. However, the Court considers that it constitutes an additional indication of the disproportionate nature of the restriction of the applicant's rights under that Article ( see, mutatis mutandis, Tănase, cited above, § 179)."

However, Article 13 of the Convention, which does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State's laws as such to be challenged before a national authority on the ground of being contrary to the Convention ( see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 85, Series A no. 98; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 113, ECHR 2002-VI; Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 137, ECHR 2005-X; and Tsonyo Tsonev v.

Under a secret additional protocol approved by the parties on the same date, as amended on 28 September 1939 and 10 January 1940, Lithuania and the other Baltic States were attributed to the USSR ’ s sphere of interest in the event of a future “territorial and political rearrangement” of the territories of these then independent countries.

In 1941 the territory was occupied by Nazi German forces. In July 1944 Soviet rule was re-established on Lithuanian territory (see Kuolelis and Others v.

On 16 February 1949 the organisation adopted a declaration stating that the LLKS Council was “the highest political authority of the nation, leading the nation ’ s political and military struggle for freedom [ aukščiausias tautos politinis organas, vadovaująs politinei ir karinei tautos išsilaisvinimo kovai ]”. The Soviet repressive structures, embodied in the NKVD (People ’ s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Народный комиссариат внутренних дел ), the MGB (Ministry of State Security, Министерство государственной безопасности ) and other bodies, sought to suppress the resistance. The system of repressive organisations was reorganised on repeated occasions. Most of the leading and operative employees of those structures were non ‑ Lithuanians sent to Lithuania from the USSR. In the 1950s the partisan movement was suppressed by the Soviet authorities, although separate partisan formations were operating for some time until after 1953, the year in which the leadership of the LLKS was captured and murdered."

On the basis of witness statements, written evidence provided by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania and statements by the applicant and his co-accused M.Ž., the court established that J.A. and A.A. had belonged to the 37th unit of the Tauras district partisans. The trial court noted that the information in the case file allowed it to conclude that, in order to compromise the partisan brothers, the Soviet authorities had spread misinformation which indicated that J.A. and A.A. had deserted from the partisan unit, were hiding alone and, thereafter, had no connection with the partisans. Those accusations were untrue. In reality, the partisans, including the brothers, J.A. and A.A., operated in small groups in order to avoid extermination by the Soviets. Lastly, there was no credible evidence in the case which would disprove the assertion that J.A. and A.A. “were members of the organised resistance and that they belonged to a political group”.

In the MGB files the two brothers had been listed as partisans, members of the armed national underground resistance ( partizanai – nacionalinio ginkluoto pogrindžio dalyviai ). The court dismissed the applicant ’ s contention that he had not actively participated in the operation to capture or to liquidate the two partisans during which those two partisans had died. On the contrary, the applicant ’ s superior officer ’ s operational file had stated that one of the bandits had been personally eliminated by the applicant. After the operation, the applicant had been admitted to the Communist Party and both he and M.Ž. had received a financial reward. Most importantly, neither the applicant nor M.Ž. denied taking part in the operation to liquidate the partisans.

The Court of Appeal indicated that the trial court had not concluded that the applicant had personally shot one of the partisans. In fact, the applicant had been sentenced only for taking part in the operation to eradicate the partisans as representatives of a political group. The applicant himself acknowledged, and it had been proven by the witnesses ’ statements and documents, that he had taken an active part in the impugned operation; that he had been responsible for M.Ž., who had shown the Soviet authorities the partisans ’ hiding place; that he had been one of the officers who had surrounded the bunker; and that he had stayed with M.Ž. until the end of the operation. In passing sentence, the Court of Appeal observed that the applicant, as an operational officer of the Šakiai district MGB who had worked voluntarily for the occupying authority (MGB) “had clearly known that the goal of that organisation was to physically exterminate the Lithuanian partisans, as part of the Lithuanian population [ tikrai žinojo, kad šios įstaigos tikslas yra Lietuvos partizanų, kaip Lietuvos gyventojų dalies, fiziškas sunaikinimas ]”. Conscious of that fact, the applicant, together with other participants in the operation, had taken part in person in the killing of the partisan brothers, J.A. and A.A. Likewise, M.Ž., as an MGB agent, also understood the goals of that organisation and by providing it with information about the partisans ’ whereabouts and showing it the partisans ’ bunker, had understood that the brothers would be exterminated. Accordingly, both the applicant and M.Ž. had acted with direct intent ( tiesioginė tyčia).

The Court of Appeal dismissed the argument by the applicant that the definition of genocide under Lithuanian law, pursuant to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, contradicted the definition enshrined in Article II of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention). The Court of Appeal noted the trial court ’ s conclusion that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had been exterminated for belonging to a “political group”. While admitting that the definition of the crime of genocide in Article 99 of the Criminal Code also included social and political groups, and was therefore wider than that established by the Genocide Convention, the Court of Appeal found that the addition of those groups was “reasonable and in line with reality”. The Genocide Convention did not contain specific provisions to the effect that the concept of genocide could be interpreted widely; however, neither did the Genocide Convention prohibit such an interpretation. The concept of genocide had been expanded in Criminal Codes of other countries. The Court of Appeal further explained that “political group means people connected by common political views and beliefs, and the goal to physically eradicate such a group also means genocide, because this involves an intention to eradicate part of the people [ politinė grupė – tai žmonės, susiję bendromis politinėmis pažiūromis ir įsitikinimais, ir siekimas tokią grupę fiziškai sunaikinti taip pat reiškia genocidą, nes siekiama sunaikinti dalį žmonių ]”. The court emphasised that",
                "“the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, that is to say, participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular ‘ political ’ group, as was done in the trial court ’ s verdict, was in essence only relative/conditional and not very precise. The members of this group had at the same time been representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group. The Soviet genocide was carried out precisely on the criteria of the inhabitants ’ nationality/ethnicity. It follows that Lithuanian partisans could be attributed not only to political, but also to national and ethnic groups, that is to say, to the groups listed in the Genocide Convention.”"

                "37. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s and M.Ž. ’ s contention that their actions did not constitute genocide because at the time of their deaths the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had not been partisans and thus could not have been considered to belong to “a political, social or other group”:",
                "“... The complaints of the convicted, V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž., also contain allegations that during the war the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had collaborated with the German occupying forces and had committed crimes. Furthermore, in 1947 they had deserted from the partisan squad and afterwards did not keep in touch with other partisans. Therefore, in the appellants ’ view, J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered members of any political, social or other group, and actions against them could not have been considered to be acts of genocide. This Chamber is of the view that these arguments have been reasonably rejected by th[is] court and have already been addressed in the judgment of conviction. Both V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž. mention certificate no. 1767 of the Lithuanian Archives Department, dated 13 November 2001. The certificate indicates that the KGB archives contain a criminal case on J.A., and that in the indictment of that case it is written that, when Germany occupied Lithuania, J.A. joined the armed squad of white partisans; he carried weapons and took part in arrests, detention and transportation of active Soviet party members and Jews. Furthermore, he conducted anti-Soviet agitation and made terrorist threats against communists, which means that he has committed the crime provided for in Article 58 1a of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [counter-revolutionary crime and treason of the motherland]. On 4 May 1945 J.A. escaped from prison and joined the partisan squad.",
                "As regards A.A., the certificate indicates that during the German occupation he served in the German police, and in 1944 he began living as an outlaw, joining the armed nationalist partisans ’ unit. It also indicates that in 1947 J.A. and A.A. left the partisan unit and went into hiding alone: they did not keep in touch with other partisans, and by order of the commander of the Tauras partisan unit were considered deserters. In respect of J.A. the same is indicated in the indictment of 16 March 1945 drawn up by the [MGB]. The specific acts that J.A. was accused of were not detailed. It appears that the above documents contain no data about the brothers ’ involvement in particular crimes against humanity. Moreover, given the charges against J.A., it is more likely that he had been accused primarily of carrying out activities against the [USSR] occupying forces themselves. There are no data in the case file about any involvement by the brothers in other criminal acts. Even in KGB documents it is indicated that from 1947 J.A. and A.A. were hiding “without committing robberies, and they did not belong to any [criminal] gang”. The Genocide and Resistance Research Centre ’ s letter entitled “Resistance activity by J.A. and A.A.” indicates that from 1945 they belonged to partisan unit no. 37... According to data from the Šakiai MGB, in 1949 [J.A. and A.A.] still belonged to partisan unit no. 37 ... Afterwards, they left the unit and took no further part in active partisan actions.",
                "In the Chamber ’ s view, the information given does not indicate that until their liquidation J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered Lithuanian partisans. In the judgment of conviction it is rightly noted that during the relevant period partisans had already been forced to fight in small groups to avoid extermination. Even in the MGB files there is an indication that in August 1952 other partisans were looking for an opportunity to meet J.A. and A.A. in order to form a single squad. The MGB therefore decided to spread the rumour that J.A. and A.A. were MGB agents. Specific plans to discredit J.A. and A.A. are apparent from the plan of 12 September 1952 confirmed by the head of the MGB board of Kaunas district ... Witness A.S. testified that in 1952 she met partisans J.A. and A.A. and supplied them with food. In addition, J.A. and A.A. gave her a certificate confirming that she was a supporter of the partisans. She has kept that certificate to this day.",
                "On 18 November 1992 the Office of the Prosecutor General cleared J.A. ’ s name in respect of crimes attributed to him in the indictment of 1 945.

In 1998 and 2002 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania posthumously granted J.A. and A.A. volunteer-fighter [ kario savanorio ] certificates.

The Šakiai district MGB was to take measures for a speedier liquidation of [J.A. and A.A.].

                "“Both of those convicted argue that the concept of genocide, as established in Article 99 of the Criminal Code, is broader than the one established in Article II of the Genocide Convention, thus not corresponding to the norms of international law. This argument must be dismissed.",
                "Indeed, Article 99 of the Criminal Code does provide for a broader concept [ platesnė nusikaltimo sudėtis ] of the crime of genocide than that in Article II of the [Genocide] Convention. According to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, genocide also comprises actions aimed at the physical eradication of some or all of the members of a social or political group. Article II of the Convention does not mention such groups.",
                "By acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, the Republic of Lithuania acquired the obligation to ensure that its norms were applied on its territory. Accordingly, by acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, Lithuania acquired the obligation to punish actions aimed at the total or partial destruction of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, and to prevent such actions. Acceding to the [Genocide] Convention does not deprive a State of the right to define actions which are crimes, and to prohibit them [ apibrėžti veikas, kurios yra nusikaltimai, ir jas uždrausti ]. This is even truer because Article V of the [above-mentioned] Convention provides that the Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and to provide penalties for those guilty of genocide or any of the other acts listed in Article III. In Lithuania, this provision has been put into force by enactment of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. The concept of genocide, as established in Article 1 of that law, corresponds to the concept of genocide established in Article II of the Genocide Convention. At the same time, when joining the Convention, in Article 2 of the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Parliament established that the killings and torture of Lithuanian people and their deportations which took place during the years under Nazi German and Soviet occupation and annexation corresponded to the characteristics of the crime of genocide as established by the norms of international law. The 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code established the elements of the crime of genocide [ apibrėžta genocido nusikaltimo sudėtis ], and included acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group. This characteristic of the crime of genocide remained in Article 99 of the Criminal Code. It is clear that adding acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group to the definition of the crime of genocide amounts to nothing more than the execution of the legal norms of Article 2 of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. It follows that the doubts by the applicant and M.Ž. about the interpretation of the concept of the crime of genocide are not founded.”"

The court dismissed arguments by the applicant and M.Ž. that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had deserted from the partisans and that at the time of their death they therefore no longer belonged to the partisans ’ political group.

It further pointed out that under the Law on the status of participants in resistance against the occupations of 1940-1990 ( Pasipriešinimo 1940-1990 metų okupacijoms dalyvių teisinio statuso įstatymas ), enacted on 28 November 1996, the partisans who fought against the occupation had been declared volunteer fighters. In 1998 and 2001 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania granted volunteer-fighter status to J.A. and A.A., which meant that they had met the condition contained in that Law that such status could only be granted to individuals who had not committed crimes against humanity or had not killed civilians."

Vasiliauskas took part in the killing of Lithuanian partisans, J.A. and A.A.: he and other MGB officers surrounded the bunker and attacked it; during the attack J.A. and A.A. were shot and killed. The trial court ’ s verdict does not state that V. Vasiliauskas himself killed any of the partisans, although data to that effect exist in the case file (the 2 January 1953 report by the head of the Šakiai district MGB).",

Involvement in the killing of members of the groups listed in Article 99 means not only committing acts causing loss of life, but also setting conditions [ sudarymas sąlygų ] so that the killings happen. It has been established that V. Vasiliauskas, as an MGB officer, together with an MGB subsection chief, took part in preparations for the operation to exterminate J.A. and A.A.; V. Vasiliauskas was armed, and during the operation he was responsible for the MGB agent [M.Ž.], who had located the partisans ’ bunker; V. Vasiliauskas stayed with M.Ž. until the end of the operation. V. Vasiliauskas himself acknowledges those actions. Having taken the above into account, the Court of Appeal arrived at the reasonable conclusion that V. Vasiliauskas had played an active role in the operation of the extermination of partisans J.A. and A.A. Even though it has not been established that V. Vasiliauskas killed either of the partisans himself, the actions he took when preparing the operation and at the time of the operation correspond to the objective element of the crime of genocide, as established in Article 99 of the Criminal Code – involvement in killing people who belong to a political group.",
                "The actions of V. Vasiliauskas also correspond to the subjective element of genocide – direct intent [ tiesioginė tyčia ]: V. Vasiliauskas, when taking those actions, had known the goal of the Soviet government – to eradicate all Lithuanian partisans. He knew that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., were partisans, and understood that during the operation they would be killed or arrested and then tortured, tried as ‘ traitors to the homeland ’ and [possibly] sentenced to death, and [V. Vasiliauskas] wished that to happen.”",

As mentioned before, under the universally recognised norms of international law, actions are considered to constitute genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying, not only in whole but also in part, any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group; when a part of the protected group is targeted, that part must be significant enough for its destruction to have an impact on the group as a whole; actions may also be recognised as genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying certain social or political groups that constitute a significant part of any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group and the destruction of which would have an impact on the respective national, ethnical, racial, or religious group as a whole. It has also been mentioned that the physical destruction of the group is the likely outcome of a forcible transfer of the population when this transfer is conducted in such a way that the group can no longer reconstitute itself – particularly when it involves the separation of its members; in such cases, the forcible transfer of individuals could lead to the destruction of the group, since the group ceases to exist as a group or, at least, as the group it was”.",

It should be noted that, in case of the absence of any proof of such an aim, in its turn it should not mean that, for their actions against residents of Lithuania (e.g., their killing, torturing, deportation, forced recruitment to the armed forces of an occupying State, persecution for political, national, or religious reasons), respective persons should not be punished according to laws of the Republic of Lithuania and universally recognised norms of international law; in view of concrete circumstances, one should assess whether those actions entail crimes against humanity or war crimes.",

The Constitutional Court also held that Article 95 of the Criminal Code, which provides that there is no statute of limitations for genocide (including genocide of social and political groups), was compatible with the Constitution. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, the Constitution allows such legal regulation when the statute of limitations is not applicable to prosecute the most serious crimes, genocide against social or political groups being one of them. The Constitutional Court then observed that, in the light of the obligation under Article 135 § 1 of the Constitution to adhere to Lithuania ’ s obligations stemming from the universally recognised international-law norms prohibiting such crimes as genocide, Lithuanian laws could not set a lower standard than those provided by international law. However, the principle of the rule of law, and thus the principles of nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege, would be breached if Lithuanian criminal legislation allowed retroactive punishment for crimes which have been defined only in accordance with the domestic law, in this case, for genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group. In other words, retroactive prosecution for genocide of social or political groups, when the genocide took place before the Criminal Code amendments of 21 April 1998, would be in breach of the Constitution and the principle of the rule of law."

                "“6.2. According to various data, due to the both occupations carried out by the USSR, the Republic of Lithuania lost almost one fifth of its population, including refugees. According to the data presented by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania, during the period of the Soviet occupation (1940-1941 and 1944 ‑ 1990), in all, 85,000 Lithuanian inhabitants perished or were killed, around 132,000 Lithuanian inhabitants were deported to the Soviet Union (at the time of the deportations of 1945-1952, 32,000 of the deportees were children). From among those perished or killed, 20,000 were participants of the armed resistance against the occupation (partisans) and their supporters (data for 1944-1952), around 1,100 – shot or tortured to death in June 1941 when the Soviet armed forces were retreating from Lithuania, around 35-37,000 political prisoners perished in special camps and prisons, and around 28,000 deportees perished in exile; on 14 June 1941, the first mass deportation of citizens of the Republic of Lithuania to Siberia began (all in all, 12,000 people were exiled then); one of the biggest repressions against the civil population was carried out in 1944-1946: up to 130,000 Lithuanian inhabitants were detained and arrested, 32,000 were repressed and transferred to special camps and prisons, around 108,400 were recruited to the USSR troops by force in 1944-1945. During the 1944-1953 partisan war against the occupation, all in all, 186,000 people were arrested and imprisoned.",
                "It is obvious from these numbers that, in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, the Soviet occupation regime perpetrated international crimes that could be qualified, according to the universally recognised norms of international law ( inter alia, the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal), as crimes against humanity (killing and extermination of civilians, deportation of residents, their imprisonment and persecution on political and national grounds, etc.) and war crimes (killing and deportation of persons protected under international humanitarian law, forced recruitment of residents of an occupied territory to the armed forces of an occupying State, etc.).",
                "It needs to be emphasised that, according to the research conducted by historians, the crimes against the residents of the Republic of Lithuania were a part of the targeted and systematic totalitarian policy pursued by the USSR: the repressions against the residents of Lithuania were not in any manner coincidental and chaotic, but rather, such repressions sought to exterminate the basis of the political nation of Lithuania, inter alia, the former social and political structure of the State of Lithuania. Those repressions were directed against the most active political and social groups of the residents of the Republic of Lithuania: participants of the resistance against the occupation and their supporters, civil servants and officials of the State of Lithuania, Lithuanian public figures, intellectuals and the academic community, farmers, priests, and members of the families of those groups. It should be noted that, by means of the repressions, the occupation regime sought to exterminate, to cause harm and break those people: they were victims of non-judicial executions, they were imprisoned and sent to special camps for forced labour, they were deported to faraway harsh-climate sparsely populated places of the Soviet Union by purposefully creating intolerable life conditions that posed constant threat to one ’ s life and health.”"

As regards the participants (partisans) of the armed resistance of the Republic of Lithuania against the Soviet occupation, account must also be taken of the fact that the Soviet Union, while ignoring the universally recognised norms of international law, neither recognised their status of combatants and prisoners of war nor provided them with the corresponding international guarantees related to such a status; from the conclusions of the historians that investigated documents of the repressive structures of the interior and security of the USSR it is clear that those structures pursued the targeted policy of the extermination of ‘ bandits ’, ‘ terrorists ’, and ‘ bourgeois nationalists ’ to which they also ascribed the Lithuanian partisans, inter alia, special ‘ extermination ’ squads were established and they were used in the fight against the Lithuanian partisans and their supporters.”"

If a group has its leadership exterminated, and at the same time or in the wake of that, has a relatively large number of the members of the group killed or subjected to other heinous acts, for example deported on a large scale or forced to flee, the cluster of violations ought to be considered in its entirety in order to interpret the provisions of the Convention in a spirit consistent with its purpose.

Although the perpetrators of genocide need not seek to destroy the entire group protected by the Convention, they must view the part of the group they wish to destroy as a distinct entity which must be eliminated as such. A campaign resulting in the killings, in different places spread over a broad geographical area, of a finite number of members of a protected group might not thus qualify as genocide, despite the high total number of casualties, because it would not show an intent by the perpetrators to target the very existence of the group as such. ...”"

The Chamber believes that it is more appropriate to speak of a ‘ reasonably substantial ’ rather than a ‘ reasonably significant ’ number. This part of the definition calls for evidence of an intention to destroy a reasonably substantial number relative to the total population of the group. According to this definition, if that criterion is not met, the mens rea may yet be established by evidence of an intention to destroy a significant section of the group, such as its leadership. While the Chamber does not reject that aspect of the definition, which sees the two elements as being alternative, there may be situations in which the inference as to the intent can not be drawn on the basis of the evidence in relation to each element in isolation, but when the evidence in relation to each is viewed as a whole, it would be perfectly proper to draw the inference.",

The drafters of the Convention also gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude.

The Chamber notes that the concepts of national, ethnical, racial and religious groups have been researched extensively and that, at present, there are no generally and internationally accepted precise definitions thereof. Each of these concepts must be assessed in the light of a particular political, social and cultural context. Moreover, the Chamber notes that for the purposes of applying the Genocide Convention, membership of a group is, in essence, a subjective rather than an objective concept. The victim is perceived by the perpetrator of genocide as belonging to a group slated for destruction. In some instances, the victim may perceive himself/herself as belonging to the said group.",
                "57. Nevertheless, the Chamber is of the view that a subjective definition alone is not enough to determine victim groups, as provided for in the Genocide Convention. It appears, from a reading of the travaux préparatoires of the Genocide Convention, that certain groups, such as political and economic groups, have been excluded from the protected groups, because they are considered to be ‘ mobile groups ’ which one joins through individual, political commitment. That would seem to suggest a contrario that the Convention was presumably intended to cover relatively stable and permanent groups.",

In Prosecutor v. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda ((Judgment), ICTR-95-54A-T, 22 January 2004, § 630), the Trial Chamber held that that the concept of a group enjoys no generally or internationally accepted definition, rather each group must be assessed in the light of a particular political, social, historical, and cultural context."

This is warranted first of all by the object and purpose of the general principles and rules of humanitarian law, in particular by the rules prohibiting crimes against humanity. The latter are intended to safeguard basic human values by banning atrocities directed against human dignity. One fails to see why only civilians and not also combatants should be protected by these rules (in particular by the rule prohibiting persecution), given that these rules may be held to possess a broader humanitarian scope and purpose than those prohibiting war crimes. However, faced with the explicit limitation laid down in Article 5, the Trial Chamber holds that a broad interpretation should nevertheless be placed on the word ‘ civilians ’, the more so because the limitation in Article 5 constitutes a departure from customary international law.",

As partisans, the brothers were considered by the Soviet authorities, including the MGB (Ministry of State Security, Министерство государственной безопасности ), to be “bandits”, “illegals” or “bourgeois nationalists” who had to be liquidated. The Soviet regime sought to annihilate the culture, religion, language, politics and identity of the Lithuanian nation, with the aim of eliminating it as a group. The Court of Appeal had thus rightly concluded that J.A. and A.A. could not only be regarded as members of a political group (as the trial court had done), but also as belonging to two groups specifically protected by the Genocide Convention, namely, a national and an ethnic group. This approach had been confirmed by the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court."

As to the applicant ’ s argument that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., could not be protected by the Genocide Convention as they had been members of the armed resistance, the Government referred to the close link between crimes against humanity and genocide. According to Professor Antonio Cassese, at least two sub-classes of crimes against humanity could be distinguished under the Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal (“the Nuremberg Principles”) : firstly, crimes committed against civilians within the framework of a widespread or systematic practice of gross violations of fundamental human rights; and, secondly, crimes of persecution against a particular group of persons, whether civilian or military, in pursuance of a discriminatory or persecutory policy or practice based on religious, racial, ethnic or political grounds ( A. Cassese, P. Gaeta, J.R.W.D. Jones (eds), The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002 ). The Government pointed out that this approach had subsequently been confirmed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in particular, in Prosecutor v.

The core of such cases was the prosecution of the applicants for acts that they allegedly committed in the 1940s and 1950s at the time when, according to the Russian Government, the Baltic States formed an integral part of the USSR (they referred to Kolk and Kislyiy, cited above; Kononov v.

Furthermore, their observations were “supersaturated” with numerous questionable facts, which they adduced in an attempt to support their unfounded assertion that the Soviet authorities had perpetrated “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (“the LSSR”). The Russian Government objected to what they considered to be a blatant distortion of historical realities and the obvious intention of the Baltic governments to modify history in accordance with their own preferences at the expense of the people whose activities in the past did not correspond to the official point of view of the present-day national authorities."

After the withdrawal of the German troops in 1944, parts of the local population refused to disarm and, instead, chose the path of military resistance to the Soviet army. These were mainly persons who had collaborated with the Nazis. The illegal armed groups were lawfully combated by the Soviet army and prosecuted by the Soviet government of the LSSR, which was the only internationally recognised authority on that territory after 1945.

Such actions may constitute a crime only if committed after the introduction of the expanded definition of genocide, unless they were already punishable under international law in force at the material time.

The fact that Raphael Lemkin, the scholar who first conceptualised the term and whom the Lithuanian Government extensively cited in their written submissions, considered that “genocide” meant “the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group” was also relevant (R. Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, 1944, p. 79).

It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Korbely v.

Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 36, Series A no. 335 ‑ B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

It stated that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was consistent with the essence of that offence “must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable”, although, exceptionally, an applicant could rely on a particular interpretation of the provision being taken by the domestic courts in the special circumstances of the case. The Court went on to examine whether there were special circumstances warranting the conclusion that the applicant, if necessary with legal advice, could have relied on a narrower interpretation of the scope of the crime of genocide by the domestic courts. The Court found that, while various authorities (international organisations, national and international courts as well as scholars and writers) had favoured both the wider and the narrower interpretations of the crime of genocide at the time of the impugned acts, Mr Jorgic, if need be with the assistance of a lawyer, could reasonably have foreseen the adoption in his case of the wider interpretation and, therefore, that he risked being charged with and convicted of genocide (see Jorgic, cited above, §§ 108-14)."

This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying out a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation.

The ICJ, when examining the drafting history of Article II of the Genocide Convention in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro ), Judgment of 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007 ), observed that the drafters of the Convention “gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude” (see paragraph 105 above). The Court finds no convincing arguments for departing from the treaty definition of genocide as established in 1948, including the list of the four protected groups referred to therein. On the contrary, all references to the crime of genocide in subsequent international-law instruments – the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968, the ICTY Statute of 1993, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) of 1994, as well as in the most recent international-law instrument – the ICC Statute of 1998 – describe that crime in similar, if not identical, terms. In particular, genocide is defined as acts committed to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, without reference to political groups (see paragraphs 83 and 85-87 above).

                "174. Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term “genocide”, proposed a broad definition of the offence. In his 1944 book [11] he addressed crimes against national groups but accepted that genocide could comprise acts aimed at destroying the national group by destroying its political institutions, culture and livelihood. The later UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) called for the preparation of a genocide Convention to protect “racial, religious, political groups and other groups”. Certain authors considered that that Resolution reflects a customary jus cogens prohibition of genocide [12] while others have questioned this view [13]. Some authors were also of the view that the final list of groups to be protected by the Genocide Convention was the result of political expediency and not the result of a principled reflection based on some philosophical or other distinction between certain types of groups. [14] In the late 1940s some commentators also expressed concern that the exclusion of political and economic groups would mean that the Genocide Convention could not address acts committed by the Soviet authorities against property owners. [15] Other authors, however, disagreed that the exclusion of political groups was the result of Soviet pressure. [16]"

                "175. Having regard to the factors outlined above, the Court finds that there are some arguments to the effect that political groups were protected by customary international law on genocide in 1953. However, there are equally strong contemporaneous countervailing views. At this juncture, the Court reiterates that notwithstanding those views favouring the inclusion of political groups in the definition of genocide, the scope of the codified definition of genocide remained narrower in the Genocide Convention and was retained in all subsequent international-law instruments (see paragraph 170 above). In sum, the Court finds that there is no sufficiently strong basis for finding that customary international law as it stood in 1953 included “political groups” among those falling within the definition of genocide.",

                "176. The Court next turns to the Government ’ s submission that because of their prominence the Lithuanian partisans were “part” of the national group, that is, a group protected by Article II of the Genocide Convention. In this connection, the Court notes that in 1953 there was no case-law by any international tribunal to provide a judicial interpretation of the definition of genocide. The travaux préparatoires to the Genocide Convention provide little guidance on what the drafters meant by the term “in part”. The early commentators of the Genocide Convention emphasised that the term “in part” contained a substantiality requirement (see paragraph 93 above). The Genocide Convention itself provides that the crime is characterised by an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, ... [a] group, as such”, and the substantiality requirement is supported by Resolution 96 (I) according to which “[g]enocide is the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups”. Bearing in mind that the goal of the Genocide Convention was to deal with mass crimes, the ICTY noted the wide acknowledgment that the intention to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group (see paragraph 98 above). The gravity of genocide is further reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before a conviction is imposed – the demanding proof of specific intent and demonstrating that the group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part (see paragraph 106 above). The Court therefore considers it reasonable to find that in 1953 it was foreseeable that the term “in part” contained a requirement as to substantiality."

            [
                "177. That said, however, the Court is mindful of subsequent developments in international case-law on the crime of genocide. Half a century after the events for which the applicant was convicted, judicial guidance as to the interpretation of the phrase “in part” emerged when cases concerning genocide were brought before the ICTY, ICTR and ICJ. In particular, as transpires from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 97 to 108 above, the intentional destruction of a “distinct” part of a protected group could be considered to be genocide of the entire protected group, provided that the “distinct” part was substantial because of the very large number of its members. Furthermore, in addition to the numerical size of the targeted part, judicial interpretation confirmed that its “prominence” within the protected group could also be a useful consideration. Be that as it may, this interpretation of the phrase “in part” could not have been foreseen by the applicant at the relevant time."

            [
                "178. In sum, the Court finds that in 1953 international treaty law did not include a “political group” in the definition of genocide, nor can it be established with sufficient clarity that customary international law provided for a broader definition of genocide than that set out in Article II of the 1948 Genocide Convention.",

                "179. The Court next turns to the Lithuanian courts ’ interpretation of the crime of genocide in the applicant ’ s case. It notes that the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged by the prosecutor, that is, guilty of the genocide of Lithuanian partisans as members of a separate political group (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above). The Court of Appeal, for its part, rephrased the applicant ’ s conviction, holding that the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, as participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular “political” group, was “only relative/conditional and not very precise”. For the Court of Appeal, the Lithuanian partisans had also been “representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group” (see paragraphs 35 and 36 in fine above). Even so, the Court of Appeal did not explain what the notion “representatives” entailed. Nor did it provide much historical or factual account as to how the Lithuanian partisans were representing the Lithuanian nation. Nor does the partisans ’ specific mantle with regard to the “national” group appear to have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which acknowledged that the applicant was “convicted of involvement in the physical extermination of a part of the Lithuanian inhabitants who belonged to a separate political group”, merely observed that between 1944 and 1953 the nation ’ s armed resistance against the Soviet occupying regime – the partisan war – took place in Lithuania (see paragraphs 39-40 above)."
            ],
            [
                "180. For its part, the Constitutional Court also acknowledged that the organised armed resistance against Soviet occupation was to be regarded as self-defence of the State of Lithuania. The partisans had led the political and military national struggle for freedom."
            ],
            [
                "181. The Court accepts that the domestic authorities have discretion to interpret the definition of genocide more broadly than that contained in the Genocide Convention. However, such discretion does not permit domestic tribunals to convict persons accused under that broader definition retrospectively. The Court has already established that in 1953 political groups were excluded from the definition of genocide under international law (see paragraph 178 above). It follows that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting the applicant for the genocide of Lithuanian partisans, for being part of a political group (see also the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, paragraph 60 above). Moreover, even if the international courts ’ subsequent interpretation of the term “in part” was available in 1953, there is no firm finding in the establishment of the facts by the domestic criminal courts to enable the Court to assess on which basis the domestic courts concluded that in 1953 the Lithuanian partisans constituted a significant part of the national group, in other words, a group protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. That being so, the Court is not convinced that at the relevant time the applicant, even with the assistance of a lawyer, could have foreseen that the killing of the Lithuanian partisans could constitute the offence of genocide of Lithuanian nationals or of ethnic Lithuanians."
            ],
            [
                "182. In addition, the Court notes that Article II of the Genocide Convention requires the perpetrator to act with intent to destroy a protected group in whole or in part. The applicant ’ s statements at the relevant time refer to action against “bandits”, the “nationalist underground” and “nationalist gangs” (see paragraphs 18 - 19 above). Moreover, the aims expressed at the MGB meetings in 1953 were directed against these groups. In the Court ’ s view, even if the MGB ’ s policy of extermination extended to “those who help them and their contacts”, the essential goal of this wider group of “Lithuanian nationalists” was to secure independence for the State of Lithuania (see, in this connection, paragraphs 13, 44 and 67 above). Indeed, as the prosecutor noted, and the appellate and cassation courts confirmed, the Lithuanian partisans were fighting against Soviet occupation and for the independence of the Lithuanian State (see paragraphs 29, 39-40 and 44 above). In the light of the above, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s argument is not without weight, namely that his actions, and those of the MGB, were aimed at the extermination of the partisans as a separate and clearly identifiable group, characterised by its armed resistance to Soviet power."

            [
                "183. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the ordinary meaning is to be given to the terms of the treaty. In this regard, it is not immediately obvious that the ordinary meaning of the terms “national” or “ethnic” in the Genocide Convention can be extended to cover partisans. Thus, the Court considers that the domestic courts ’ conclusion that the victims came within the definition of genocide as part of a protected group was an interpretation by analogy, to the applicant ’ s detriment, which rendered his conviction unforeseeable (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A; see also Korbely, cited above, § 70)."

            [
                "184. On this last point, the Court also gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the definition of the crime of genocide in Lithuanian law not only had no basis in the wording of that offence as expressed in the Genocide Convention, but had also been gradually enlarged during the years of Lithuania ’ s independence, thus further aggravating his situation (see paragraphs 51 - 53 and 123 above). It has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court that to prosecute retroactively for the genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group, if the events took place before those two groups were added to the Criminal Code, would be against the rule of law and in breach of Lithuania ’ s obligations under international law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court cannot accept the argument by the Supreme Court that the 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code, expanding the definition of genocide to include “political groups”, could be justified on the basis of Article V of the Genocide Convention. While Article V of the Genocide Convention does not prohibit expanding the definition of genocide, it does not authorise the application of a broader definition of genocide retroactively (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 93, 17 September 2009, and Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 )."

Serbia and Montenegro (cited above), the Court considers that the gravity of genocide is reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before this conviction is imposed. These requirements – the proof of specific intent and the demonstration that the protected group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part – guard against a danger that convictions for this crime will be imposed lightly (see paragraph 112 above). Noting the Lithuanian courts ’ arguments in the instant case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant ’ s conviction for the crime of genocide could be regarded as consistent with the essence of that offence as defined in international law at the material time and thus could reasonably have been foreseen by him in 1953."

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws (see X. v.

This argument is inconsistent with the travaux préparatoires which imply that Article 7 § 1 can be considered to contain the general rule of non-retroactivity and that Article 7 § 2 is only a contextual clarification of the liability limb of that rule, included so as to ensure that there was no doubt about the validity of prosecutions after the Second World War in respect of the crimes committed during that war (see Kononov, cited above, § 186). It is thus clear that the drafters of the Convention did not intend to allow for any general exception to the rule of non-retroactivity. Indeed, the Court has held in a number of cases that the two paragraphs of Article 7 are interlinked and are to be interpreted in a concordant manner (see, for example, Tess v.

The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law.

As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.

The applicant joined a Soviet commando unit composed of members of the “Red Partisans” ( a Soviet force which fought a guerrilla war against the German forces). In March 1944 he was put in command of a platoon by his two immediate superiors, whose primary objectives were, according to the applicant, to sabotage military installations, communication lines and German supply points, to derail trains and to spread political propaganda among the local population.

[However, ] the Republic of Latvia continued to exist as a subject of international law, as was recognised by more than fifty States worldwide ...",
                "After analysing the merits of the judgment, the Senate ... considers that, to the extent that the Criminal Affairs Division found that V. Kononov came within the scope of section 68-3 of the Criminal Code, ... his acts were correctly characterised, as, in his capacity as a belligerent and combatant on Latvian territory occupied by the USSR, he has violated the laws and customs of war, in that he planned and directed a military operation aimed at taking reprisals against civilians, namely peaceable inhabitants of the village of Mazie Bati, nine of whom were killed ...

Kononov was accused of, irrespective of when they came into force. [This is consistent] with the United Nations Convention of 26 November 1968 on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. [The Court of Appeal stated] that the Republic of Latvia, which had been occupied by the USSR, had not been able to take a decision [to that end] earlier. By referring to the principle of the non-applicability of statutory limitation, the Court of Appeal complied with the obligations arising under the international treaties and held the persons guilty of committing the offences concerned criminally liable irrespective of the date they were perpetrated.",

Kononov organised, commanded and led a Partisan military operation intent on taking reprisals through the massacre of the civilian population of the village of Mazie Bati and the pillage and destruction of the villagers ’ farms. That being so, the Court of Appeal rightly found that the acts of individual members of his group ... could not be seen as [mere] excesses on the part of those concerned.",

The effectiveness of some of the conventions signed at The Hague on 18 October 1907 as direct treaty obligations was considerably impaired by the incorporation of a so-called ‘ general participation clause ’ in them, providing that the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] would be binding only if all the Belligerents were parties to it. The effect of this clause, is, in strict law, to deprive some of the conventions of their binding force as direct treaty obligations, either from the very beginning of a war or in the course of it as soon as a non-signatory Power, however insignificant, joins the ranks of the Belligerents. Although the obligation to observe the provisions of the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] as a binding treaty may be swept away by operation of the ‘ general participation clause ’, or otherwise, the [Hague] Convention [(IV)] remains as good evidence of the customary law of nations, to be considered by the Tribunal along with all other available evidence in determining the customary law to be applied in any given situation. ...”"

In this respect, the offence could be defined in written and unwritten, domestic or international law and Article 7 did not outlaw gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation so long as the resultant development was consistent with the essence of the offence.

In any event, any such Partisan tribunal judgment would have been unlawful as it would have been delivered in absentia in violation of even the basic tenets of a fair trial. The respondent Government had submitted to the Chamber letters dated February 2008 from the Prosecutor General ’ s Office (about the existence of the Partisan tribunal, the role of Mazie Bati and its villagers in the German defence and why arms had been issued to the villagers) and resubmitted these to the Grand Chamber."

During that Soviet occupation, Latvia was prevented from exercising its sovereign powers, including its international obligations. Apart from the resultant fear of the local population of the Red Partisans, it was a distortion for the applicant to suggest that the events of 27 May 1944 in Mazie Bati were a civil war incident as opposed to part of the international armed conflict opposing the Axis powers and, inter alia, the USSR."

In any event, even if they had lost that status and were to be considered “combatants”, nothing allowed the summary execution and murder of any person hors de combat unless a fair trial had taken place (and there was no proof of this) wherein it was established that they were indeed implicated in a criminal offence. Moreover, these were not lawful acts of “lawful belligerent reprisals” since, inter alia, such actions had been prohibited against prisoners of war since the 1929 Geneva Convention and, as regards civilians, it was never suggested that the villagers committed war crimes themselves."

His conviction was also objectively foreseeable given, inter alia, the declarations of certain States during the Second World War and the international and national prosecutions during and immediately after that war, in which processes the Soviet authorities had much involvement. That he was a Soviet war hero for years thereafter was not relevant: the key point was whether the acts could have been reasonably foreseen in 1944 as amounting to war crimes and not that his later fortuitous political situation would have excluded his prosecution.

Whether such “general principles” were a primary or secondary source of international law, they were derived from national systems to fill gaps in positive and customary international law.

Contrary to paragraph 118 of the Chamber judgment, the Lithuanian Government considered that this issue had to be taken into account when examining notably the legal status of the belligerent forces in the Baltic States at the time. Indeed, the Court had already recognised that all three Baltic States had lost their independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ( the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 and its secret Protocol, the Treaty on Borders and Friendly Relations of 1939 and its secret Protocol, as well as the third Nazi-Soviet secret Protocol of 10 January 1941): the Pact was an undisputed historical fact, an illegal agreement to commit aggression against, inter alia, the Baltic States and resulted in their illegal occupation by Soviet forces. Indeed, the Soviet invasion of the Baltic States in June 1940 was an act of aggression within the meaning of the London Convention on the Definition of Aggression of 1933 and the Convention between Lithuania and the USSR on the Definition of Aggression of 1933. The involuntary consent of the Baltic States faced with Soviet aggression did not render this act of aggression lawful.",
                "The USSR itself had earlier treated the Anschluss as an international crime. In addition, in 1989 the USSR recognised ( in the Resolution on the Political and Juridical Appraisal of the Soviet-German Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939) its unlawful aggression against the Baltic States. Two conclusions followed: the USSR had not obtained any sovereign rights to the Baltic States so that under international law the Baltic States were never a legitimate part of the USSR and, additionally, the Baltic States continued to exist as international legal persons after the 1940 aggression by the USSR which aggression resulted in the illegal occupation of the Baltic States.",
                "Applying that to the facts in the present case, the Lithuanian Government argued that the Baltic States suffered aggression from the USSR and Nazi Germany: the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg characterised aggression in such a way as to treat both aggressors in the same manner. The Baltic peoples had no particular reason to feel sympathy with either and, indeed, had rational fears against both aggressors (in this respect, the Lithuanian Government take issue with paragraph 130 of the Chamber judgment given the well-established historical fact of USSR crimes in the Baltic States) so that a degree of collaboration with one aggressor in self-defence should not be treated differently. The peoples of the Baltic States could not be considered to have been Soviet citizens, as they retained under international law their Baltic nationality, but were rather inhabitants of an occupied State who sought safety from both occupying belligerent forces."

                "A number of instruments were relevant, in addition to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations, especially the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) and the 1977 Protocol Additional. It was a core principle of international humanitarian law in 1944 that there was a fundamental distinction between armed forces (belligerents) and the peaceful populations (civilians) and that the latter enjoyed immunity from military attack ( in that respect, they cited the Martens Clause; see paragraphs 86 to 87 above). The villagers did not meet the criteria defining “ combatants ” and were not therefore a lawful military target. Even if there had been some degree of collaboration by the villagers with the German forces, they had to retain civilian protection unless they met the “ combatant ” criteria: the opposite view would leave a population at the mercy of belligerent commanders who could arbitrarily decide that they were combatants and thus a legitimate military target. The killing of the women, unless they were taking part in hostilities as combatants, was not in any circumstances justified, as it would always have been contrary to the most elementary considerations and laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience. In that regard, the Government specifically took issue with paragraphs 141 and 142 the Chamber judgment."

                "185. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written and unwritten law and which implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability. As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; K. ‑ H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Jorgic v.

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws ( see X. v. Belgium, no. 268/57, Commission decision of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, p. 241).

The domestic courts found the villagers to be “civilians”, an analysis supported by the Latvian Government.

This could mean that the applicant lost “ combatant ” status [22] (thereby losing the right to attack [23] ) and wearing the enemy uniform during combat could of itself have amounted to an offence [24]. However, the domestic courts did not charge the applicant with a separate war crime on this basis. This factor does have some bearing, nonetheless, on other related war crimes of which he was accused (notably, treacherous killing and wounding, see paragraph 217 below).

Earlier treaty provisions and declarations would indicate that by 1944 “civilians” were defined a contrario to the definition of “ combatants ” [29].

                "207. While the notion of war crimes can be traced back centuries, the mid-nineteenth century saw a period of solid codification of the acts constituting a war crime and for which an individual could be held criminally liable. The Lieber Code 1863 ( see paragraphs 63-77 above) outlined a multitude of offences against the laws and customs of war and prescribed punishments, and individual criminal responsibility was inherent in numerous of its Articles [33]. While it was an American Code, it was the first modern codification of the laws and customs of war and was influential in later codification conferences, notably in Brussels in 1874 ( see paragraph 79 above). The Oxford Manual 1880 forbade a multitude of acts as contrary to the laws and customs of war and explicitly provided for “offenders to be liable to punishment specified in the penal law”. These earlier codifications, and in particular the Draft Brussels Declaration 1874, in turn inspired the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. These latter instruments were the most influential of the earlier codifications and were, in 1907, declaratory of the laws and customs of war: they defined, inter alia, relevant key notions (combatants, levée en masse, hors de combat ), they listed detailed offences against the laws and customs of war and they provided a residual protection, through the Martens Clause, to inhabitants and belligerents for cases not covered by the specific provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. Responsibility therein was on States, which had to issue consistent instructions to their armed forces and pay compensation if their armed forces violated those rules.",
                "The impact on the civilian population of the First World War prompted provisions in the Treaties of Versailles and Sèvres on the responsibility, trial and punishment of alleged war criminals. The work of the International Commission in 1919 (after the First World War) and of the United Nations War Crimes Commission ( UNWCC ) (during the Second World War) made significant contributions to the principle of individual criminal liability in international law. “Geneva law” (notably the Conventions of 1864, 1906 and 1929; see paragraphs 53 to 62 above) protected the victims of war and provided safeguards for disabled armed forces personnel and persons not taking part in hostilities. Both the “Hague” and the “Geneva” branches of law were closely interrelated, the latter supplementing the former.",
                "The Charter of the IMT Nuremberg provided a non-exhaustive definition of war crimes for which individual criminal responsibility was retained and the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg opined that the humanitarian rules in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations were “recognised by all civilised nations and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war” by 1939 and that violations of those provisions constituted crimes for which individuals were punishable. There was agreement in contemporary doctrine that international law had already defined war crimes and required individuals to be prosecuted [34]. In consequence, the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was not ex post facto criminal legislation. The later Nuremberg Principles, drawn from the Charter and judgment of the IMT Nuremberg, reiterated the definition of war crimes set out in the Charter and that anyone committing a crime under international law was responsible and liable to punishment [35]."

International prosecution through the IMTs was the exception, the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg explicitly recognising the continuing role of the domestic courts. Accordingly, the international liability of the State based on treaties and conventions [36] did not preclude the customary responsibility of States to prosecute and punish individuals, via their criminal courts or military tribunals, for violations of the laws and customs of war. International and national law (the latter including transposition of international norms) served as a basis for domestic prosecutions and liability. In particular, where national law did not provide for the specific characteristics of a war crime, the domestic court could rely on international law as a basis for its reasoning, without infringing the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena sine lege [37]."

Turning to the practice of such domestic tribunals, the Court notes that, while many States prohibited war crimes in their domestic legal systems and military manuals prior to the First World War, very few prosecuted their own war criminals [38], although the US courts martial in the Philippines were a significant and informative exception [39] as was the occurrence of the “ Leipzig ” and Turkish trials after the First World War. Lastly, during the Second World War there was a signalled intent from the outset to ensure the prosecution of war criminals [40] and, parallel to international prosecutions, the principle of domestic prosecutions of war criminals was maintained [41]. Accordingly, as well as the important IMT prosecutions, domestic trials took place during the Second World War (notably in the USSR) [42] and immediately after the Second World War [43], all concerning alleged war crimes committed during that war, certain trials being notable for their comprehensive treatment of relevant principles of the laws and customs of war, particularly as regards the necessity of a fair trial of combatants and civilians suspected of war crimes."

The Court has noted the detailed and conflicting submissions of the parties and the third parties on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR in 1940 and, consequently, on whether the acts on 27 May 1944 had any nexus to an international armed conflict and could therefore be considered as war crimes. The Grand Chamber considers (as did the Chamber, at paragraph 112 of its judgment) that it is not its role to pronounce on the question of the lawfulness of Latvia ’ s incorporation into the USSR and, in any event in the present case, it is not necessary to do so. While in 1944 a nexus with an international armed conflict was required to prosecute acts as war crimes, that did not mean that only armed forces personnel or nationals of a belligerent State could be so accused. The relevant nexus was a direct connection between the alleged crime and the international armed conflict so that the alleged crime had to be an act in furtherance of war objectives [44]. The domestic courts found that the operation on 27 May 1944 was mounted given the suspicion that certain villagers had cooperated with the German military administration so that it is evident that the impugned events had a direct connection to the USSR/German international armed conflict and were ostensibly carried out in furtherance of the Soviet war objectives."

The notion of criminal responsibility for the acts of subordinates is drawn from two long-established customary rules: a combatant, in the first place, must be commanded by a superior and, secondly, must obey the laws and customs of war ( see paragraph 200 above) [45]. Individual criminal responsibility for the actions of subordinates was retained in certain trials prior to the Second World War [46], in codifying instruments and State declarations during and immediately after that war [47], and it was retained in (national and international) trials of crimes committed during the Second World War [48].

In its later Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion [53], the ICJ referred to the two “ cardinal principles contained in the texts constituting the fabric of humanitarian law”. The first, referred to above, was the principle of distinction which aimed at the “protection of the civilian population and objects” and the second was the “obligation to avoid unnecessary suffering to combatants” [54]. Relying expressly on the Martens Clause, the ICJ noted that the Hague and Geneva Conventions had become “intransgressible principles of international customary law” as early as the judgment of the IMT Nuremberg. This was because, according to the ICJ, a great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict were fundamental to “the respect of the human person” and to “elementary considerations of humanity”. Those principles, including the Martens Clause, constituted legal norms against which conduct in the context of war was to be measured by courts [55]."

It considers, having regard notably to Article 23 (c) of the Hague Regulations, that, even if the deceased villagers were considered combatants or civilians who had participated in hostilities, jus in bello in 1944 considered the circumstances of their murder and ill-treatment a war crime since those acts violated a fundamental rule of the laws and customs of war protecting an enemy rendered hors de combat. For this protection to apply, a person had to be wounded, disabled or unable for another reason to defend him/herself (including not carrying arms), a person was not required to have a particular legal status, and a formal surrender was not required [56]. As combatants, the villagers would also have been entitled to protection as prisoners of war under the control of the applicant and his unit and their subsequent ill-treatment and summary execution would have been contrary to the numerous rules and customs of war protecting prisoners of war (noted at paragraph 202 above). Accordingly, the ill-treatment, wounding and killing of the villagers constituted a war crime."

Secondly, the Court finds that the domestic courts reasonably relied on Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations to found a separate conviction as regards treacherous wounding and killing. The concepts of treachery and perfidy were closely linked at the relevant time so that the wounding or killing was considered treacherous if it was carried out while unlawfully inducing the enemy to believe they were not under threat of attack by, for example, making improper use of an enemy uniform. As noted at paragraphs 16 and 201 above, the applicant and his unit were indeed wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms during the operation in Mazie Bati. Article 23 (b) of the Hague Regulations clearly applies if the villagers are considered “combatants” and could also apply if they were considered “ civilians who had participated in hostilities ”. In this latter respect, the text of Article 23 (b) referred to killing or wounding treacherously “ individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army ”, which could have been interpreted as including any persons under some form of control of a hostile army including the civilian population of an occupied territory."

That women, especially pregnant women, should be the object of special protection during war was part of the laws and customs of war as early as the Lieber Code 1863 (Articles 19 and 37). It was further developed through “Geneva law ” on prisoners of war (women were considered especially vulnerable in this situation) [57]. The Court considers these expressions of “special protection”, understood in conjunction with the protection of the Martens Clause ( see paragraphs 86-87 and 215 above), sufficient to find that there was a plausible legal basis for convicting the applicant of a separate war crime as regards the burning to death of Mrs Krupniks.

On the contrary, the Court notes that the 1926 Criminal Code was conceived of as a system to pursue “dangerous social acts” which could harm the established socialist order [60], the terminology in the Official Notes to section 14 illustrating this. In such circumstances, a domestic prosecution for war crimes in 1944 would have required reference to international law, not only as regards the definition of such crimes, but also as regards the determination of any applicable limitation period."

Previous international declarations [61] on the responsibility for, and obligation to prosecute and punish, war crimes did not refer to any applicable limitation periods [62]. While Article II (5) of Control Council Law No. 10 addressed the issue as regards war crimes committed on German territory prior to and during the Second World War, neither the Charters of the IMT Nuremberg/Tokyo, nor the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 nor the Nuremberg Principles contained any provisions concerning the prescriptibility of war crimes (as confirmed by the Preamble to the 1968 Convention)."

Secondly, he argued that it was politically unforeseeable that he would be prosecuted: his conviction following the restoration of independence of Latvia in 1991 was a political exercise by the Latvian State rather than any real wish to fulfil international obligations to prosecute war criminals."

Persons carrying on a professional activity must proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation and can be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails ( see Pessino v.

As to whether the qualification of the impugned acts as war crimes, based as it was on international law exclusively, could be considered to be sufficiently accessible and foreseeable to the applicant in 1944, the Court notes that it has previously found that the individual criminal responsibility of a private soldier (a border guard) was defined with sufficient accessibility and foreseeability by, inter alia, a requirement to comply with international fundamental human rights instruments, which instruments did not, of themselves, give rise to individual criminal responsibility and one of which had not been ratified by the relevant State at the material time ( see K.-H.W. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 92-105 ). The Court considered that even a private soldier could not show total, blind obedience to orders which flagrantly infringed not only domestic law, but internationally recognised human rights, in particular the right to life, a supreme value in the international hierarchy of human rights ( ibid., § 75)."

The present applicant was a sergeant in the Soviet Army assigned to the reserve regiment of the Latvian Division: at the material time, he was a member of a commando unit and in command of a platoon whose primary activities were military sabotage and propaganda. Given his position as a commanding military officer, the Court is of the view that he could have been reasonably expected to take such special care in assessing the risks that the operation in Mazie Bati entailed. The Court considers that, having regard to the flagrantly unlawful nature of the ill-treatment and killing of the nine villagers in the established circumstances of the operation on 27 May 1944 ( see paragraphs 15-20 above), even the most cursory reflection by the applicant would have indicated that, at the very least, the impugned acts risked being counter to the laws and customs of war as understood at that time and, notably, risked constituting war crimes for which, as commander, he could be held individually and criminally accountable."

                "179. The Court next turns to the Lithuanian courts ’ interpretation of the crime of genocide in the applicant ’ s case. It notes that the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged by the prosecutor, that is, guilty of the genocide of Lithuanian partisans as members of a separate political group (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above). The Court of Appeal, for its part, rephrased the applicant ’ s conviction, holding that the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, as participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular “political” group, was “only relative/conditional and not very precise”. For the Court of Appeal, the Lithuanian partisans had also been “representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group” (see paragraphs 35 and 36 in fine above). Even so, the Court of Appeal did not explain what the notion “representatives” entailed. Nor did it provide much historical or factual account as to how the Lithuanian partisans were representing the Lithuanian nation. Nor does the partisans ’ specific mantle with regard to the “national” group appear to have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which acknowledged that the applicant was “convicted of involvement in the physical extermination of a part of the Lithuanian inhabitants who belonged to a separate political group”, merely observed that between 1944 and 1953 the nation ’ s armed resistance against the Soviet occupying regime – the partisan war – took place in Lithuania (see paragraphs 39-40 above)."
            ],
            [
                "180. For its part, the Constitutional Court also acknowledged that the organised armed resistance against Soviet occupation was to be regarded as self-defence of the State of Lithuania. The partisans had led the political and military national struggle for freedom."
            ],
            [
                "181. The Court accepts that the domestic authorities have discretion to interpret the definition of genocide more broadly than that contained in the Genocide Convention. However, such discretion does not permit domestic tribunals to convict persons accused under that broader definition retrospectively. The Court has already established that in 1953 political groups were excluded from the definition of genocide under international law (see paragraph 178 above). It follows that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting the applicant for the genocide of Lithuanian partisans, for being part of a political group (see also the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, paragraph 60 above). Moreover, even if the international courts ’ subsequent interpretation of the term “in part” was available in 1953, there is no firm finding in the establishment of the facts by the domestic criminal courts to enable the Court to assess on which basis the domestic courts concluded that in 1953 the Lithuanian partisans constituted a significant part of the national group, in other words, a group protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. That being so, the Court is not convinced that at the relevant time the applicant, even with the assistance of a lawyer, could have foreseen that the killing of the Lithuanian partisans could constitute the offence of genocide of Lithuanian nationals or of ethnic Lithuanians."
            ],
            [
                "182. In addition, the Court notes that Article II of the Genocide Convention requires the perpetrator to act with intent to destroy a protected group in whole or in part. The applicant ’ s statements at the relevant time refer to action against “bandits”, the “nationalist underground” and “nationalist gangs” (see paragraphs 18 - 19 above). Moreover, the aims expressed at the MGB meetings in 1953 were directed against these groups. In the Court ’ s view, even if the MGB ’ s policy of extermination extended to “those who help them and their contacts”, the essential goal of this wider group of “Lithuanian nationalists” was to secure independence for the State of Lithuania (see, in this connection, paragraphs 13, 44 and 67 above). Indeed, as the prosecutor noted, and the appellate and cassation courts confirmed, the Lithuanian partisans were fighting against Soviet occupation and for the independence of the Lithuanian State (see paragraphs 29, 39-40 and 44 above). In the light of the above, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s argument is not without weight, namely that his actions, and those of the MGB, were aimed at the extermination of the partisans as a separate and clearly identifiable group, characterised by its armed resistance to Soviet power."

                "183. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the ordinary meaning is to be given to the terms of the treaty. In this regard, it is not immediately obvious that the ordinary meaning of the terms “national” or “ethnic” in the Genocide Convention can be extended to cover partisans. Thus, the Court considers that the domestic courts ’ conclusion that the victims came within the definition of genocide as part of a protected group was an interpretation by analogy, to the applicant ’ s detriment, which rendered his conviction unforeseeable (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A; see also Korbely, cited above, § 70)."
            ],
            [
                "184. On this last point, the Court also gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the definition of the crime of genocide in Lithuanian law not only had no basis in the wording of that offence as expressed in the Genocide Convention, but had also been gradually enlarged during the years of Lithuania ’ s independence, thus further aggravating his situation (see paragraphs 51 - 53 and 123 above). It has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court that to prosecute retroactively for the genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group, if the events took place before those two groups were added to the Criminal Code, would be against the rule of law and in breach of Lithuania ’ s obligations under international law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court cannot accept the argument by the Supreme Court that the 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code, expanding the definition of genocide to include “political groups”, could be justified on the basis of Article V of the Genocide Convention. While Article V of the Genocide Convention does not prohibit expanding the definition of genocide, it does not authorise the application of a broader definition of genocide retroactively (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 93, 17 September 2009, and Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 )."

                "185. Consistently with the ICJ in Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (cited above), the Court considers that the gravity of genocide is reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before this conviction is imposed. These requirements – the proof of specific intent and the demonstration that the protected group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part – guard against a danger that convictions for this crime will be imposed lightly (see paragraph 112 above). Noting the Lithuanian courts ’ arguments in the instant case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant ’ s conviction for the crime of genocide could be regarded as consistent with the essence of that offence as defined in international law at the material time and thus could reasonably have been foreseen by him in 1953."

On the basis of witness statements, written evidence provided by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania and statements by the applicant and his co-accused M.Ž., the court established that J.A. and A.A. had belonged to the 37th unit of the Tauras district partisans. The trial court noted that the information in the case file allowed it to conclude that, in order to compromise the partisan brothers, the Soviet authorities had spread misinformation which indicated that J.A. and A.A. had deserted from the partisan unit, were hiding alone and, thereafter, had no connection with the partisans. Those accusations were untrue. In reality, the partisans, including the brothers, J.A. and A.A., operated in small groups in order to avoid extermination by the Soviets. Lastly, there was no credible evidence in the case which would disprove the assertion that J.A. and A.A. “were members of the organised resistance and that they belonged to a political group”.

In the MGB files the two brothers had been listed as partisans, members of the armed national underground resistance ( partizanai – nacionalinio ginkluoto pogrindžio dalyviai ). The court dismissed the applicant ’ s contention that he had not actively participated in the operation to capture or to liquidate the two partisans during which those two partisans had died. On the contrary, the applicant ’ s superior officer ’ s operational file had stated that one of the bandits had been personally eliminated by the applicant. After the operation, the applicant had been admitted to the Communist Party and both he and M.Ž. had received a financial reward. Most importantly, neither the applicant nor M.Ž. denied taking part in the operation to liquidate the partisans.

The Court of Appeal indicated that the trial court had not concluded that the applicant had personally shot one of the partisans. In fact, the applicant had been sentenced only for taking part in the operation to eradicate the partisans as representatives of a political group. The applicant himself acknowledged, and it had been proven by the witnesses ’ statements and documents, that he had taken an active part in the impugned operation; that he had been responsible for M.Ž., who had shown the Soviet authorities the partisans ’ hiding place; that he had been one of the officers who had surrounded the bunker; and that he had stayed with M.Ž. until the end of the operation. In passing sentence, the Court of Appeal observed that the applicant, as an operational officer of the Šakiai district MGB who had worked voluntarily for the occupying authority (MGB) “had clearly known that the goal of that organisation was to physically exterminate the Lithuanian partisans, as part of the Lithuanian population [ tikrai žinojo, kad šios įstaigos tikslas yra Lietuvos partizanų, kaip Lietuvos gyventojų dalies, fiziškas sunaikinimas ]”. Conscious of that fact, the applicant, together with other participants in the operation, had taken part in person in the killing of the partisan brothers, J.A. and A.A. Likewise, M.Ž., as an MGB agent, also understood the goals of that organisation and by providing it with information about the partisans ’ whereabouts and showing it the partisans ’ bunker, had understood that the brothers would be exterminated.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the argument by the applicant that the definition of genocide under Lithuanian law, pursuant to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, contradicted the definition enshrined in Article II of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention). The Court of Appeal noted the trial court ’ s conclusion that the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had been exterminated for belonging to a “political group”. While admitting that the definition of the crime of genocide in Article 99 of the Criminal Code also included social and political groups, and was therefore wider than that established by the Genocide Convention, the Court of Appeal found that the addition of those groups was “reasonable and in line with reality”. The Genocide Convention did not contain specific provisions to the effect that the concept of genocide could be interpreted widely; however, neither did the Genocide Convention prohibit such an interpretation. The concept of genocide had been expanded in Criminal Codes of other countries. The Court of Appeal further explained that “political group means people connected by common political views and beliefs, and the goal to physically eradicate such a group also means genocide, because this involves an intention to eradicate part of the people [ politinė grupė – tai žmonės, susiję bendromis politinėmis pažiūromis ir įsitikinimais, ir siekimas tokią grupę fiziškai sunaikinti taip pat reiškia genocidą, nes siekiama sunaikinti dalį žmonių ]”. The court emphasised that",
                "“the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, that is to say, participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular ‘ political ’ group, as was done in the trial court ’ s verdict, was in essence only relative/conditional and not very precise. The members of this group had at the same time been representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group. The Soviet genocide was carried out precisely on the criteria of the inhabitants ’ nationality/ethnicity. It follows that Lithuanian partisans could be attributed not only to political, but also to national and ethnic groups, that is to say, to the groups listed in the Genocide Convention.”"

            [
                "37. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s and M.Ž. ’ s contention that their actions did not constitute genocide because at the time of their deaths the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had not been partisans and thus could not have been considered to belong to “a political, social or other group”:",
                "“... The complaints of the convicted, V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž., also contain allegations that during the war the brothers, J.A. and A.A., had collaborated with the German occupying forces and had committed crimes. Furthermore, in 1947 they had deserted from the partisan squad and afterwards did not keep in touch with other partisans. Therefore, in the appellants ’ view, J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered members of any political, social or other group, and actions against them could not have been considered to be acts of genocide. This Chamber is of the view that these arguments have been reasonably rejected by th[is] court and have already been addressed in the judgment of conviction. Both V. Vasiliauskas and M.Ž. mention certificate no. 1767 of the Lithuanian Archives Department, dated 13 November 2001. The certificate indicates that the KGB archives contain a criminal case on J.A., and that in the indictment of that case it is written that, when Germany occupied Lithuania, J.A. joined the armed squad of white partisans; he carried weapons and took part in arrests, detention and transportation of active Soviet party members and Jews. Furthermore, he conducted anti-Soviet agitation and made terrorist threats against communists, which means that he has committed the crime provided for in Article 58 1a of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [counter-revolutionary crime and treason of the motherland]. On 4 May 1945 J.A. escaped from prison and joined the partisan squad.",
                "As regards A.A., the certificate indicates that during the German occupation he served in the German police, and in 1944 he began living as an outlaw, joining the armed nationalist partisans ’ unit. It also indicates that in 1947 J.A. and A.A. left the partisan unit and went into hiding alone: they did not keep in touch with other partisans, and by order of the commander of the Tauras partisan unit were considered deserters. In respect of J.A. the same is indicated in the indictment of 16 March 1945 drawn up by the [MGB]. The specific acts that J.A. was accused of were not detailed. It appears that the above documents contain no data about the brothers ’ involvement in particular crimes against humanity. Moreover, given the charges against J.A., it is more likely that he had been accused primarily of carrying out activities against the [USSR] occupying forces themselves. There are no data in the case file about any involvement by the brothers in other criminal acts. Even in KGB documents it is indicated that from 1947 J.A. and A.A. were hiding “without committing robberies, and they did not belong to any [criminal] gang”. The Genocide and Resistance Research Centre ’ s letter entitled “Resistance activity by J.A. and A.A.” indicates that from 1945 they belonged to partisan unit no. 37... According to data from the Šakiai MGB, in 1949 [J.A. and A.A.] still belonged to partisan unit no. 37 ... Afterwards, they left the unit and took no further part in active partisan actions.",
                "In the Chamber ’ s view, the information given does not indicate that until their liquidation J.A. and A.A. could not have been considered Lithuanian partisans. In the judgment of conviction it is rightly noted that during the relevant period partisans had already been forced to fight in small groups to avoid extermination. Even in the MGB files there is an indication that in August 1952 other partisans were looking for an opportunity to meet J.A. and A.A. in order to form a single squad. The MGB therefore decided to spread the rumour that J.A. and A.A. were MGB agents. Specific plans to discredit J.A. and A.A. are apparent from the plan of 12 September 1952 confirmed by the head of the MGB board of Kaunas district ... Witness A.S. testified that in 1952 she met partisans J.A. and A.A. and supplied them with food. In addition, J.A. and A.A. gave her a certificate confirming that she was a supporter of the partisans. She has kept that certificate to this day.",
                "On 18 November 1992 the Office of the Prosecutor General cleared J.A. ’ s name in respect of crimes attributed to him in the indictment of 1 945. The prosecutor indicated that from October 1944 to May 1945 J.A. was unlawfully imprisoned. In 1998 and 2002 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania posthumously granted J.A. and A.A. volunteer-fighter [ kario savanorio ] certificates. It is clear that the MGB itself had considered J.A. and A.A. to be partisans from the report of 11 June 1952, in which the head of the Kaunas MGB informed the LSSR Minister of the Interior that measures had been adopted to ascertain the hiding place of [J.A. and A.A.] and liquidate them. The Šakiai district MGB was to take measures for a speedier liquidation of [J.A. and A.A.]. All this served to prove that when putting those plans into action J.A. and A.A. had been killed as participants in the armed resistance.”",

                "“Both of those convicted argue that the concept of genocide, as established in Article 99 of the Criminal Code, is broader than the one established in Article II of the Genocide Convention, thus not corresponding to the norms of international law. This argument must be dismissed.",
                "Indeed, Article 99 of the Criminal Code does provide for a broader concept [ platesnė nusikaltimo sudėtis ] of the crime of genocide than that in Article II of the [Genocide] Convention. According to Article 99 of the Criminal Code, genocide also comprises actions aimed at the physical eradication of some or all of the members of a social or political group. Article II of the Convention does not mention such groups.",
                "By acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, the Republic of Lithuania acquired the obligation to ensure that its norms were applied on its territory. Accordingly, by acceding to the [Genocide] Convention, Lithuania acquired the obligation to punish actions aimed at the total or partial destruction of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, and to prevent such actions. Acceding to the [Genocide] Convention does not deprive a State of the right to define actions which are crimes, and to prohibit them [ apibrėžti veikas, kurios yra nusikaltimai, ir jas uždrausti ]. This is even truer because Article V of the [above-mentioned] Convention provides that the Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and to provide penalties for those guilty of genocide or any of the other acts listed in Article III. In Lithuania, this provision has been put into force by enactment of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania. The concept of genocide, as established in Article 1 of that law, corresponds to the concept of genocide established in Article II of the Genocide Convention. At the same time, when joining the Convention, in Article 2 of the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Parliament established that the killings and torture of Lithuanian people and their deportations which took place during the years under Nazi German and Soviet occupation and annexation corresponded to the characteristics of the crime of genocide as established by the norms of international law. The 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code established the elements of the crime of genocide [ apibrėžta genocido nusikaltimo sudėtis ], and included acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group. This characteristic of the crime of genocide remained in Article 99 of the Criminal Code. It is clear that adding acts aimed at the physical extermination of some or all of the members of a social or political group to the definition of the crime of genocide amounts to nothing more than the execution of the legal norms of Article 2 of the Law of 9 April 1992 on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania.

In 1998 and 2001 the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania granted volunteer-fighter status to J.A. and A.A., which meant that they had met the condition contained in that Law that such status could only be granted to individuals who had not committed crimes against humanity or had not killed civilians."

Involvement in the killing of members of the groups listed in Article 99 means not only committing acts causing loss of life, but also setting conditions [ sudarymas sąlygų ] so that the killings happen. It has been established that V. Vasiliauskas, as an MGB officer, together with an MGB subsection chief, took part in preparations for the operation to exterminate J.A. and A.A.; V.

The Prosecutor General ’ s decision states that, taking into consideration the conclusions set out in the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling to the effect that retroactive prosecution for genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group was in breach of the principle of the rule of law, it had to be ascertained whether the applicant and his co-accused, M.Ž., were to be considered innocent, guilty of genocide or, as another alternative, whether they might have committed some other criminal activity. A prosecutor from the Office of the Prosecutor General was appointed to examine those newly discovered circumstances."

Consequently, it could not be the basis for requesting the Supreme Court to reopen the applicant ’ s criminal case. Accordingly, this constituted a legal impediment to an application to the Supreme Court to reopen the criminal procedure in the applicant ’ s case.",

On the same date the Supreme Council adopted the provisional Constitution – the Provisional Fundamental Law of the Republic of Lithuania ( Laikinasis Pagrindinis Įstatymas ), setting out the constitutional principles of the re-established independent State of Lithuania. In particular, this Law referred to Lithuania as a sovereign democratic republic, power being vested in the people and exercised by the Supreme Council, the government and the judiciary. Moreover, it provided that all earlier laws and legal acts continued to be in force as long as they were not incompatible with this new Law. This Law remained valid until 2 November 1992.

On the night of 23 March 1953, the applicant, acting together with the commanding officers of the Kaunas region Šakiai district MGB and with the aim of killing or capturing and deporting the partisans who were hiding at a house in the Šakiai district, took part in an operation in which partisan J.B. was injured and arrested.

In August 1953 the partisan was deported from Lithuania to a special camp within the territory of the former USSR.

Having reviewed the relevant international-law instruments, including the case-law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Constitutional Court took the view that States have a certain discretion, because of particular historical, political, social and cultural contexts, to establish in their domestic law a broader definition of the crime of genocide than that which is established in international law.

On account of their nationality, the persons belonging to “untrustworthy” nations were doomed to extermination, inter alia, by means of unbearable living conditions in exile.

Thus, with consideration of such an international and historical context, inter alia, the aforesaid ideology of the totalitarian communist regime of the USSR upon which the extermination of entire groups of people was grounded, the scale of repressions of the USSR against residents of the Republic of Lithuania, which was a part of the targeted policy of the extermination of the basis of Lithuania ’ s political nation and of the targeted policy of the treatment of Lithuanians as an ‘ unreliable ’ nation, the conclusion should be drawn that, during a certain period (in 1941, when mass deportations of Lithuanians to the Soviet Union began and non-judicial executions of detained persons were carried out, and in 1944-1953, when mass repressions were carried out during the guerrilla war against the occupation of the Republic of Lithuania), the crimes perpetrated by the Soviet occupation regime, in case of the proof of the existence of a special purpose aimed at destroying, in whole or in part, any national, ethnic, racial or religious group, might be assessed as genocide as defined according to the universally recognised norms of international law ( inter alia, according to the Convention Against Genocide). As mentioned before, under the universally recognised norms of international law, actions are considered to constitute genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying, not only in whole but also in part, any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group; when a part of the protected group is targeted, that part must be significant enough for its destruction to have an impact on the group as a whole; actions may also be recognised as genocide if they are deliberate actions aimed at destroying certain social or political groups that constitute a significant part of any national, ethnical, racial, or religious group and the destruction of which would have an impact on the respective national, ethnical, racial, or religious group as a whole. It has also been mentioned that the physical destruction of the group is the likely outcome of a forcible transfer of the population when this transfer is conducted in such a way that the group can no longer reconstitute itself – particularly when it involves the separation of its members; in such cases, the forcible transfer of individuals could lead to the destruction of the group, since the group ceases to exist as a group or, at least, as the group it was”.",

It should be noted that, in case of the absence of any proof of such an aim, in its turn it should not mean that, for their actions against residents of Lithuania (e.g., their killing, torturing, deportation, forced recruitment to the armed forces of an occupying State, persecution for political, national, or religious reasons), respective persons should not be punished according to laws of the Republic of Lithuania and universally recognised norms of international law; in view of concrete circumstances, one should assess whether those actions entail crimes against humanity or war crimes.",

The Constitutional Court then observed that, in the light of the obligation under Article 135 § 1 of the Constitution to adhere to Lithuania ’ s obligations stemming from the universally recognised international-law norms prohibiting such crimes as genocide, Lithuanian laws could not set a lower standard than those provided by international law. However, the principle of the rule of law, and thus the principles of nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege, would be breached if Lithuanian criminal legislation allowed retroactive punishment for crimes which have been defined only in accordance with the domestic law, in this case, for genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group.

During the 1944-1953 partisan war against the occupation, all in all, 186,000 people were arrested and imprisoned.",

Those repressions were directed against the most active political and social groups of the residents of the Republic of Lithuania: participants of the resistance against the occupation and their supporters, civil servants and officials of the State of Lithuania, Lithuanian public figures, intellectuals and the academic community, farmers, priests, and members of the families of those groups. It should be noted that, by means of the repressions, the occupation regime sought to exterminate, to cause harm and break those people: they were victims of non-judicial executions, they were imprisoned and sent to special camps for forced labour, they were deported to faraway harsh-climate sparsely populated places of the Soviet Union by purposefully creating intolerable life conditions that posed constant threat to one ’ s life and health.”"

A corroborating argument will be the fate of the rest of the group. The character of the attack on the leadership must be viewed in the context of the fate or what happened to the rest of the group. If a group has its leadership exterminated, and at the same time or in the wake of that, has a relatively large number of the members of the group killed or subjected to other heinous acts, for example deported on a large scale or forced to flee, the cluster of violations ought to be considered in its entirety in order to interpret the provisions of the Convention in a spirit consistent with its purpose. Similarly, the extermination of a group ’ s law enforcement and military personnel may be a significant section of a group in that it renders the group at large defenceless against other abuses of a similar or other nature, particularly if the leadership is being eliminated as well.

Although the perpetrators of genocide need not seek to destroy the entire group protected by the Convention, they must view the part of the group they wish to destroy as a distinct entity which must be eliminated as such. A campaign resulting in the killings, in different places spread over a broad geographical area, of a finite number of members of a protected group might not thus qualify as genocide, despite the high total number of casualties, because it would not show an intent by the perpetrators to target the very existence of the group as such. ...”"

The numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point, though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry. The number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms, but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group. In addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion, its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration.

The United Nations Expert Study on Genocide defines the term ‘ in part ’ as implying ‘ a reasonably significant number, relative to the total of the group as a whole, or else a significant section of a group such as its leadership ’. This definition means that, although the complete annihilation of the group is not required, it is necessary to establish ‘ the intention to destroy at least a substantial part of a particular group ’. The Chamber believes that it is more appropriate to speak of a ‘ reasonably substantial ’ rather than a ‘ reasonably significant ’ number. This part of the definition calls for evidence of an intention to destroy a reasonably substantial number relative to the total population of the group. According to this definition, if that criterion is not met, the mens rea may yet be established by evidence of an intention to destroy a significant section of the group, such as its leadership. While the Chamber does not reject that aspect of the definition, which sees the two elements as being alternative, there may be situations in which the inference as to the intent can not be drawn on the basis of the evidence in relation to each element in isolation, but when the evidence in relation to each is viewed as a whole, it would be perfectly proper to draw the inference.",

The drafters of the Convention also gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude. The Court spoke to the same effect in 1951 in declaring as an object of the Convention the safeguarding of ‘ the very existence of certain human groups ’ ( Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951, p. 23). Such an understanding of genocide requires a positive identification of the group.

According to the Government ’ s submission of 11 April 2014, the procedural step taken for the reopening of the applicant ’ s criminal case should lead to the conclusion that the applicant ’ s situation was in the process of being resolved at the national level (they referred to Pisano v. Italy (striking out) [GC], no. 36732/97, §§ 40-50, 24 October 2002).

Lithuania signed the Convention without reservation. For the applicant, any expansion of the concept by the addition of “social and political groups” in 1998 was, therefore, impermissible. The applicant further noted that the exhaustive definition of the crime of genocide which limited protection to four specific groups was established in the Law on responsibility for genocide of inhabitants of Lithuania of 9 April 1992. He also maintained that the Lithuanian delegates argued for the expansion of the concept of genocide in 1998, when the International Criminal Court (ICC) was established within the framework of the United Nations.

In the light of Article 7 of the Convention, he claimed that criminal liability for genocide in respect of those two groups was thus not applicable at one particular point in time but was applicable at another, although the facts potentially giving rise to an issue were the same. In his specific case, he contended, the Lithuanian State had applied the criminal law retroactively, despite the fact that from 1992 to 1998 the State itself regarded the applicant ’ s actions as not constituting the crime of genocide. Even acknowledging that the crime of genocide could be prosecuted retroactively, he submitted that it was difficult to accept that criminal liability for such a crime depended on the State ’ s ability to amend the legislation or to find new characteristics of the crime which were relevant only for Lithuania.

He accepted that Lithuania had a sovereign right to pass its own laws. However, that right was not an absolute one. Firstly, all of its laws had to comply with the Lithuanian Constitution pursuant to which international treaties which have been ratified by Lithuania are an integral part of its national law. As to the elements of the Lithuanian criminal law, namely, the inclusion of political and social groups in Article 99 of the Criminal Code, these were not covered by Article II of the Genocide Convention.

This approach had been confirmed by the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling of 18 March 2014, which acknowledged that retroactive prosecution for the genocide of a political or social group, when the crime was committed prior to the amendment of the Criminal Code establishing responsibility for genocide of persons belonging to those two categories, was unconstitutional."

He accepted that the number of victims in Lithuania “in the years 1939-53 was about 500,000 Lithuanians”. That being so, the applicant nevertheless observed that between 1941 and 1944 Lithuania had been under German occupation. During that time the Nazis, together with their local auxiliaries, had killed hundreds of thousands of innocent persons in Lithuania.

After the Soviets returned to Lithuania in 1944, the authorities lawfully prosecuted J.A. and A.A. for those crimes. In any case, the applicant claimed that J.A. and A.A. had left the partisans years before the events in issue. Accordingly, J.A. and A.A. had not been partisans on the day of their death in 1953.

They sought to exterminate the former social and political structure of the State, which was the very basis of the political nation of Lithuania.

Partisans did not profess any specific political views other than that independence should be restored to Lithuania and the Soviets driven out of the country. They came together under nationalist symbols and were able to maintain their resistance for ten years in the harshest conditions of the Soviet repressions because they received significant support from the Lithuanian people.

The repressive USSR institutions had employed a number of severe measures to suppress the underground movement: deportations of families of resistance members, torture of resistance members, acts of psychological warfare or terror and punitive actions against resistance members and their supporters, such as the burning of villages and extrajudicial executions. Most of these measures were applied in clear breach of international law, and of the Constitution of the USSR and other Soviet laws.

In this connection, the Government referred to Resolution 1481 (2006) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the need for international condemnation of crimes of totalitarian communist regimes (see paragraph 89 above).

Furthermore, the Government relied upon UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, adopted unanimously and without debate, which had affirmed that genocide was a crime under international law and had noted that “crimes of genocide have occurred when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part”.

The Soviet regime sought to annihilate the culture, religion, language, politics and identity of the Lithuanian nation, with the aim of eliminating it as a group. The Court of Appeal had thus rightly concluded that J.A. and A.A. could not only be regarded as members of a political group (as the trial court had done), but also as belonging to two groups specifically protected by the Genocide Convention, namely, a national and an ethnic group.

According to Professor Antonio Cassese, at least two sub-classes of crimes against humanity could be distinguished under the Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal (“the Nuremberg Principles”) : firstly, crimes committed against civilians within the framework of a widespread or systematic practice of gross violations of fundamental human rights; and, secondly, crimes of persecution against a particular group of persons, whether civilian or military, in pursuance of a discriminatory or persecutory policy or practice based on religious, racial, ethnic or political grounds ( A. Cassese, P. Gaeta, J.R.W.D. Jones (eds), The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002 ).

Such actions may constitute a crime only if committed after the introduction of the expanded definition of genocide, unless they were already punishable under international law in force at the material time.

Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, 1944, p. 79).

It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.

In Jorgic, there were two possible interpretations of the term “to destroy” in the definition of the crime of genocide and the Court examined the compatibility of the applicant ’ s conviction, on the basis of the wider interpretation (destruction of a distinct social unit as opposed to physical destruction), with Article 7 of the Convention. It stated that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was consistent with the essence of that offence “must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable”, although, exceptionally, an applicant could rely on a particular interpretation of the provision being taken by the domestic courts in the special circumstances of the case. The Court went on to examine whether there were special circumstances warranting the conclusion that the applicant, if necessary with legal advice, could have relied on a narrower interpretation of the scope of the crime of genocide by the domestic courts. The Court found that, while various authorities (international organisations, national and international courts as well as scholars and writers) had favoured both the wider and the narrower interpretations of the crime of genocide at the time of the impugned acts, Mr Jorgic, if need be with the assistance of a lawyer, could reasonably have foreseen the adoption in his case of the wider interpretation and, therefore, that he risked being charged with and convicted of genocide (see Jorgic, cited above, §§ 108-14)."

The scope of the concept of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying out a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see Pessino v. France, no. 40403/02, § 33, 10 October 2006)."

A State practice of tolerating or encouraging certain acts that have been deemed criminal offences under national or international legal instruments and the sense of impunity which such a practice instils in the perpetrators of such acts does not prevent their being brought to justice and punished (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, §§ 74 and 77-79)."

The Court begins by noting that the crime of genocide prohibited by Article II of the Genocide Convention lists four protected groups of persons: national, ethnic, racial and religious. That provision does not refer to social or political groups. Furthermore, the travaux préparatoires disclose an intention by the drafters not to include political groups in the list of those protected by the Genocide Convention. The ICJ, when examining the drafting history of Article II of the Genocide Convention in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (( Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro ), Judgment of 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007 ), observed that the drafters of the Convention “gave close attention to the positive identification of groups with specific distinguishing characteristics in deciding which groups they would include and which (such as political groups) they would exclude” (see paragraph 105 above). The Court finds no convincing arguments for departing from the treaty definition of genocide as established in 1948, including the list of the four protected groups referred to therein. On the contrary, all references to the crime of genocide in subsequent international-law instruments – the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968, the ICTY Statute of 1993, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) of 1994, as well as in the most recent international-law instrument – the ICC Statute of 1998 – describe that crime in similar, if not identical, terms. In particular, genocide is defined as acts committed to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, without reference to political groups (see paragraphs 83 and 85-87 above). In the Court ’ s view, the fact that certain States decided later to criminalise genocide of a political group in their domestic laws (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above) does not, as such, alter the reality that the text of the Genocide Convention did not do so."

The indictment of October 1945 before the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, as well as certain prosecutors ’ oral submissions, charged the defendants with genocide, the significance of which is not necessarily undermined by the fact that the final judgment made no mention of the crime of genocide. UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, adopted unanimously and without debate, affirmed the existence of the international crime of genocide. There followed several references in indictments to the crime of genocide, and convictions for crimes with genocidal purposes in the post-Nuremberg trials under Control Council Law no. 10 [9] as well as in the trials by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland (1946-48) of Hoess and Greiser [10].

The later UN General Assembly Resolution 96 (I) called for the preparation of a genocide Convention to protect “racial, religious, political groups and other groups”. Certain authors considered that that Resolution reflects a customary jus cogens prohibition of genocide [12] while others have questioned this view [13]. Some authors were also of the view that the final list of groups to be protected by the Genocide Convention was the result of political expediency and not the result of a principled reflection based on some philosophical or other distinction between certain types of groups. [14] In the late 1940s some commentators also expressed concern that the exclusion of political and economic groups would mean that the Genocide Convention could not address acts committed by the Soviet authorities against property owners.

In this connection, the Court notes that in 1953 there was no case-law by any international tribunal to provide a judicial interpretation of the definition of genocide. The travaux préparatoires to the Genocide Convention provide little guidance on what the drafters meant by the term “in part”. The early commentators of the Genocide Convention emphasised that the term “in part” contained a substantiality requirement (see paragraph 93 above). The Genocide Convention itself provides that the crime is characterised by an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, ... [a] group, as such”, and the substantiality requirement is supported by Resolution 96 (I) according to which “[g]enocide is the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups”. Bearing in mind that the goal of the Genocide Convention was to deal with mass crimes, the ICTY noted the wide acknowledgment that the intention to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group (see paragraph 98 above). The gravity of genocide is further reflected in the stringent requirements which must be satisfied before a conviction is imposed – the demanding proof of specific intent and demonstrating that the group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial part (see paragraph 106 above). The Court therefore considers it reasonable to find that in 1953 it was foreseeable that the term “in part” contained a requirement as to substantiality."

Half a century after the events for which the applicant was convicted, judicial guidance as to the interpretation of the phrase “in part” emerged when cases concerning genocide were brought before the ICTY, ICTR and ICJ. In particular, as transpires from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 97 to 108 above, the intentional destruction of a “distinct” part of a protected group could be considered to be genocide of the entire protected group, provided that the “distinct” part was substantial because of the very large number of its members. Furthermore, in addition to the numerical size of the targeted part, judicial interpretation confirmed that its “prominence” within the protected group could also be a useful consideration.

The Court of Appeal, for its part, rephrased the applicant ’ s conviction, holding that the attribution of the Lithuanian partisans, as participants in armed resistance to occupational power, to a particular “political” group, was “only relative/conditional and not very precise”. For the Court of Appeal, the Lithuanian partisans had also been “representatives of the Lithuanian nation, that is, the national group” (see paragraphs 35 and 36 in fine above). Even so, the Court of Appeal did not explain what the notion “representatives” entailed. Nor did it provide much historical or factual account as to how the Lithuanian partisans were representing the Lithuanian nation. Nor does the partisans ’ specific mantle with regard to the “national” group appear to have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which acknowledged that the applicant was “convicted of involvement in the physical extermination of a part of the Lithuanian inhabitants who belonged to a separate political group”, merely observed that between 1944 and 1953 the nation ’ s armed resistance against the Soviet occupying regime – the partisan war – took place in Lithuania (see paragraphs 39-40 above)."

The Court has already established that in 1953 political groups were excluded from the definition of genocide under international law (see paragraph 178 above). It follows that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting the applicant for the genocide of Lithuanian partisans, for being part of a political group (see also the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, paragraph 60 above). Moreover, even if the international courts ’ subsequent interpretation of the term “in part” was available in 1953, there is no firm finding in the establishment of the facts by the domestic criminal courts to enable the Court to assess on which basis the domestic courts concluded that in 1953 the Lithuanian partisans constituted a significant part of the national group, in other words, a group protected under Article II of the Genocide Convention. That being so, the Court is not convinced that at the relevant time the applicant, even with the assistance of a lawyer, could have foreseen that the killing of the Lithuanian partisans could constitute the offence of genocide of Lithuanian nationals or of ethnic Lithuanians."

Moreover, the aims expressed at the MGB meetings in 1953 were directed against these groups. In the Court ’ s view, even if the MGB ’ s policy of extermination extended to “those who help them and their contacts”, the essential goal of this wider group of “Lithuanian nationalists” was to secure independence for the State of Lithuania (see, in this connection, paragraphs 13, 44 and 67 above). Indeed, as the prosecutor noted, and the appellate and cassation courts confirmed, the Lithuanian partisans were fighting against Soviet occupation and for the independence of the Lithuanian State (see paragraphs 29, 39-40 and 44 above).

It has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court that to prosecute retroactively for the genocide of persons belonging to a political or social group, if the events took place before those two groups were added to the Criminal Code, would be against the rule of law and in breach of Lithuania ’ s obligations under international law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court cannot accept the argument by the Supreme Court that the 1998 amendments to the Criminal Code, expanding the definition of genocide to include “political groups”, could be justified on the basis of Article V of the Genocide Convention. While Article V of the Genocide Convention does not prohibit expanding the definition of genocide, it does not authorise the application of a broader definition of genocide retroactively (see Scoppola v.

Although the Court has, on only one occasion, applied Article 7 § 2 in the context of post-Second World War and Soviet deportations (see Penart and Kolk and Kislyiy, both cited above ), the Grand Chamber in Kononov (cited above, § 186 ) noted the original and exceptional purpose of that paragraph:",

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux préparatoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws (see X. v.

This argument is inconsistent with the travaux préparatoires which imply that Article 7 § 1 can be considered to contain the general rule of non-retroactivity and that Article 7 § 2 is only a contextual clarification of the liability limb of that rule, included so as to ensure that there was no doubt about the validity of prosecutions after the Second World War in respect of the crimes committed during that war (see Kononov, cited above, § 186). It is thus clear that the drafters of the Convention did not intend to allow for any general exception to the rule of non-retroactivity. Indeed, the Court has held in a number of cases that the two paragraphs of Article 7 are interlinked and are to be interpreted in a concordant manner (see, for example, Tess v.

The Court is unable to agree with that argument on the basis of the following observations. First, the principle that more lenient provisions of criminal law must be applied retrospectively is implicitly guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. That principle is embodied in the rule that where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of the offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see, mutatis mutandis, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009, and Koprivnikar v. Slovenia, no. 67503/13, § 49, 24 January 2017).

The court firstly gave a summary of the applicants ’ defence submissions, the public prosecutor ’ s observations on the merits of the case, and the evidence in the case file. That evidence included the flyers that had been found in İzmir, as well as the documents, books and periodicals found in the apartments of the first applicant and the other co-accused. The court also listed as evidence the organisation ’ s alleged manifesto ( tüzük ), which had been discovered in the apartment of a co-accused. Having considered the structure, methods, purpose and activities of the organisation in question, the court concluded that it was a terrorist organisation, contrary to the submissions of the accused and the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The court found that the amendments made to section 1 of Law no. 3713, namely the inclusion of the term “ using violence and coercion ” in the definition of a terrorist organisation, did not exclude situations where an unarmed organisation adopted violence and coercion as its aim, even when its acts only amounted to “ moral coercion” ( manevi cebir ). A contrary interpretation of the provision would render its application to unarmed terrorist organisations impossible. The court noted that even though the members of the organisation had not resorted to physical violence, they had used “ moral coercion” – such as issuing threats, as was apparent from the confiscated documents – in order to achieve their aims. The court stressed that the organisation ’ s manifesto and some of the flyers contained statements which were of sufficient gravity to coerce people morally.

After convening in five other congresses, namely in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, [and] in their final and last congress of 1996, they named themselves the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan/Turkey and declared that their aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey for the leadership of the working class, and for this reason they have engaged in the acts of distributing leaflets and declarations.",

Moreover, they have distributed and sold the publications Çağrı and Güney – which can be considered the organisation ’ s legal publications – in order to support the organisation financially.",
                "The accused have denied the accusations, in particular the existence of the organisation, and in any event have stated that their acts could not be considered crimes ... since no armed acts had been committed on behalf of the organisation ... The public prosecutor submitted that the organisation in question no longer corresponded to the definition provided for by law, in the light of the recent amendments made to Law no. 3713, and requested that the accused be acquitted.",
                "Therefore, what is at issue in the present case is whether the acts of the accused correspond to the amended definition of membership of a terrorist organisation ... In considering whether an organisation qualifies as a terrorist organisation, its structure, working methods, purpose and acts must be taken into account. The amended section 1 of Law no. 3713 requires [the use of] force and violence as an element of terror. It is sufficient for an organisation to adopt force and violence as its purpose to bring [the organisation] within the scope of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Coercion may just as well present itself as moral coercion. Terror is any criminal act committed for the purpose of achieving the ultimate goals listed in section 1 of Law no. 3713. ‘ Purpose ’ as worded in this section subsumes the purpose of using violence and force, and therefore envisages [the provision being applied] to unarmed organisations. Any conclusion that is contrary to this reasoning will render the application of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to unarmed organisations impossible, which will pave the way for them to work freely towards their goal of overthrowing democracy and the Turkish Republic. In democracies, people may be given all freedoms except for the freedom to destroy democracy. Since the legislature cannot be presumed to have given licence to organisations whose purpose is to ruin and divide the State, it necessarily follows that unarmed organisations fall within the scope of the law in question.",
                "Everyone has a right to freely declare their thoughts and opinions in the public sphere. However, when people establish an organisation to impose their ideas on others with the aim of changing the Constitution and bringing about the cessation of the State through violence and coercion, it can be considered that the constituent element of the crime, namely moral coercion, is presumed. In the light of this general overview, it can be considered that the acts of the accused are those of disseminating propaganda for an already existing organisation by means of distributing leaflets and thereby encouraging membership. [This] evidence obtained during the investigation has clearly revealed the aim which the accused have pursued. The ultimate purpose of the accused is to change the regime of the country by overthrowing the democracy and the Republic through a popular revolution [ ... ] thereby introducing a totalitarian regime based on Marxist and Leninist ideology. [ ... ] On pages 19, 20 and 21 of the organisation ’ s manifesto ... the Turkish Republic was insulted. [The manifesto] states that Turkey occupies lands that belong to Kurdistan and Armenia, and that the Kurdish people lead a justified resistance movement in North Kurdistan against the unjust and dirty war led by the fascist Turkish Republic. The dead terrorist İbrahim Kaypakkaya is mentioned ... On the following pages, Marxist and Leninist practices are praised and the quasi-feudal capitalist system is mentioned. The last chapter contains the party ’ s disciplinary procedures ... In a declaration which carries the emblem of the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan /Turkey, it is stated ‘ the history of the Ottoman Empire reeks of massacres and crimes ... 1.5 million Armenians were massacred ... and the fascist Turkish army is merely a continuation of the Ottoman Empire ... the real enemy is the fascist Turkish Republic ... unite under the red flag of the Bolshevik party in order to overthrow the fascist Turkish Republic with a democratic people ’ s revolution, and wave the red flag of Bolshevism in cities, castles, farms and mountains so that we can finally throw the fascist Turkish State into the gutters of history ... ’",

There are many documents which incite people to revolt against the regime and the State and wage war on the Government by taking to the mountains. However, it is not possible to quote all of them in the judgment. They have been identified individually in the present judgment under the category of written evidence. In the light of this examination, it appears that the aim of the Bolshevik Party is to change the regime and bring about the secession of part of the national territory of Northern Kurdistan. It is considered that the organisation has started working towards these aims but has not yet engaged in armed attacks. [However,] the mere existence of such discourse in the organisation ’ s manifesto and declaration is sufficient to coerce people morally .”"

Article 7 ECHR links the principle of legality to the commission of an act or an omission; a crime should thus consist in a material behaviour.

That court had concluded that the acts of which the applicants stood accused, namely forming an organisation with the aim of encouraging people to revolt against the Turkish State and distributing flyers, had included the element of violence required under those provisions. According to the Government, the domestic court ’ s use of the concept of moral coercion had been in accordance with the law and had been sufficiently foreseeable for the applicants, who had in any event committed the acts before the relevant amendments to the law in question had been made.

It also sets out, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where an individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him or her criminally liable ( see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, § 242, 28 June 2018). When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 141, ECHR 2008 ). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (ibid., with further references)."

In that connection, the parties disagree as to whether moral coercion – a concept which does not exist in the text of the applicable law – can nevertheless be regarded as subsumed by the requirement of “violence and force”, which is a constituent element of a terrorist offence under the amended versions of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

The Court observes that at the relevant time Law no. 3713 did not contain a separate definition of a terrorist organisation. Rather, the definitions of terrorism and terrorist organisation were intertwined as formulated in section 1 of the same law. In its original version, terrorism was described as any act committed by means of pressure, force and violence, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat, with one or more of the political or ideological aims listed under that section, while an organisation was simply defined as any type of association of two or more people to pursue a common goal. In the amended 2003 version of section 1, it appears that the term “using force and violence” is referred separately from the methods of terrorism. The emphasis is put on the commission of an act through the use of force and violence and a further element – namely the impugned acts committed by members of such an organisation being criminal in nature – has been introduced. Moreover, it is no longer possible to call an association of two or more people a terrorist organisation unless their purpose of coming together is to pursue the commission of a terrorist offence."

The Government have made the argument that the applicants ’ conviction was foreseeable in accordance with the original versions of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713 – in force at the time the offences were committed – given that those provisions had in any event defined terrorism in a broader sense. The Court is unable to agree with that argument on the basis of the following observations. First, the principle that more lenient provisions of criminal law must be applied retrospectively is implicitly guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. That principle is embodied in the rule that where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of the offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see, mutatis mutandis, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009, and Koprivnikar v. Slovenia, no. 67503/13, § 49, 24 January 2017). The Court also notes in that connection that in Turkish criminal law, courts are required to comply with Article 7 § 2 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with which the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied (see also Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, § 51, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

                "65. Secondly, although the applicants were convicted under section 7(1) of Law no. 3713 before its amendment by Law no. 5532, the domestic court ’ s final decision convicting the applicants under that provision took into account the amended 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 with respect to the definition of terrorism. Accordingly, the domestic courts reached the conclusion that the element of “force and violence” had been satisfied in the light of the finding that the applicants ’ activities had constituted moral coercion since they had adopted force and violence as their goal. Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic courts in convicting the applicants discussed at length whether the amendments made to Law no. 3713 had restricted or broadened the term “force and violence” by limiting it to armed or physical acts of violence and force. Having concluded that a restrictive interpretation would run contrary to the purpose of the law, the domestic courts held that the term “force and violence” should be interpreted broadly and include situations where violence, although not used in the ordinary physical sense, was nevertheless adopted as a goal of an organisation. Since the domestic courts themselves applied the amended version of section 1 in conjunction with the original version of section 7 to the applicants, the Court will confine its examination of the lawfulness of the applicants ’ conviction to those versions and not to those in force at the time of commission of the offence. In that respect, the Court will examine whether the domestic courts ’ broad interpretation of the text of the law in convicting the applicants was reasonably foreseeable for the purposes of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention. In so doing, the Court will have regard to whether the interpretation in question was the resultant development of a perceptible line of case-law or its application in broader circumstances was nevertheless consistent with the essence of the offence (see, inter alia, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 36, Series A no. 335-B, and Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, §§ 101-107, ECHR 2007 ‑ III )."

The Court observes in that connection that the Government did not present the Court with a comparable case in which an association was deemed to be a terrorist organisation on the sole basis of the nature of its written declarations and despite the absence of violent acts attributable to that organisation. It further notes that the Government did not present the Court with examples of domestic case-law that made use of the concept of “ moral coercion ” in the context of terrorist offences. The only example that mentions moral coercion in the context of offences against the integrity of the State post-dates the applicants ’ conviction and in any event cannot be deemed authoritative since it was struck down by the Constitutional Court of Turkey for being incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on fact-specific grounds (see paragraph 46 above)."

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the impugned concept is compatible with the essence of the offence, that is to say, invoking it in the circumstances of the case could be considered as reasonable irrespective of whether it was invoked by the domestic courts the first time."

The Court notes in that connection that the July 2003 legislative amendments to the provisions of Law no. 3713 narrowed down the definition of “terrorism” and “terrorist organisation”. Accordingly, the domestic law included several cumulative conditions for an association to be treated as a terrorist organisation. Those conditions are, inter alia : the intent to commit criminal acts; through the use of force and violence; and additional methods of pressure, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat; for one of the listed ideological or political motives. The wording of the relevant provisions of Law no. 3713 suggests that the essence of the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation is to join an association whose goal and mode of operation is to resort to the criminal use of force, violence and mass intimidation in order to advance certain political or ideological causes. The fact that the law-makers chose to single out the use of violence as a necessary means to commit terrorism in the 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 lends support to the conclusion that actual violence or the intent to use such violence is central to the definition of the offence."

It is also undisputed that there was no evidence that the organisation in question had engaged in any violent acts or that it had intended to pursue its aims through the use of force and violence or other terrorist methods. Finally, it was the first time that the domestic courts were called to determine whether the organisation could be proscribed as a terrorist organisation since there existed no judicial precedents concerning the same organisation.

Nevertheless, the Court finds relevant the case-law of the Court of Cassation that, where domestic courts are confronted with the task of assessing for the first time whether an organisation can be classified as terrorist, they must carry out a thorough investigation and examine the nature of the organisation by scrutinising its purpose, whether it has adopted an action plan or similar operational measures, and whether it has resorted to violence or a credible threat to use violence in pursuing that action plan (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above)."

In that respect, the domestic courts relied on the information note prepared by the Security Directorate, which considered the organisation in question a Marxist-Leninist illegal organisation whose ultimate aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey. The domestic courts also relied on the flyers distributed in the streets of İzmir, as well as the organisation ’ s manifesto discovered in a co-accused ’ s apartment, and found that the views expressed therein, because of their objectionable character, amounted to moral coercion of the public, therefore fulfilling the requirement of force and violence for the purposes of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

In that respect, while the domestic courts held that the organisation in question had not engaged in any armed attacks, they did not address the question whether the organisation had adopted an action plan or similar operational measures for such a purpose. In this connection, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case-file that the organisation in question, beyond the mere proclamation of certain goals, had adopted any concrete preparatory steps or indeed any form of action with a view to carrying out violent acts.

                "84. The Court reiterates that the fact that “freedom of movement” is guaranteed as such under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, which Turkey has signed but not ratified, is irrelevant, given that one and the same fact may fall foul of more than one provision of the Convention and its Protocols (see Poiss v. Austria, 23 April 1987, § 66, Series A no. 117 ). Moreover, the Court has examined similar complaints under Article 8 of the Convention by having regard to the fact that freedom of movement, particularly across borders, is considered essential to the full development of a person ’ s private life, especially when he or she has family, professional and economic ties in several countries ( see İletmiş v. Turkey, no. 29871/96, § 50, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII; Paşaoğlu v. Turkey, no. 8932/03, §§ 42-43, 8 July 2008; see also, mutatis mutandis, Riener v. Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 134, 23 May 2006, and Pfeifer v. Bulgaria, no. 24733/04, §§ 59-62, 17 February 2011 ). In that connection, submitting the necessary documents to that effect, the second applicant has substantiated before the domestic authorities as well as the Court that he was a lawful resident of Germany, and that he worked as a freelance journalist. Lastly, with regard to the Government ’ s objection concerning the alleged lack of a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that the parties do not dispute the fact that the applicant was a non-resident at the material time and that his life prior to his arrest in Turkey was based in Germany. In that respect the Court considers that the effects of the travel ban on the applicant ’ s private life in so far as it prevented him from returning to his place of residence cannot be underestimated. The Court also considers that it cannot be excluded that the travel ban had pecuniary implications for the applicant. Accordingly, there are no grounds for concluding that the applicant has suffered no significant disadvantage."

Finally, they argued that the period to be taken into account in respect of the travel ban should only be the duration when the applicant had the status of the accused, that is between 21 January and 24 July 2003 and between 8 April 2004 and 16 March 2006, in total approximately 2 years and 5 months."

With regard to the “legitimate aim”, the Court accepts that such a measure may have served the aim of preventing the second applicant from fleeing abroad, and thus of ensuring his presence during the criminal proceedings and the possibility of enforcing any resultant sentence. It is therefore satisfied that the interference with the second applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention pursued the legitimate aim of securing his availability for trial, and hence the prevention of disorder and crime."

                "92. As regards the proportionality of the measure in question, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the second applicant was the subject of criminal proceedings. In that respect, the Court reiterates that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty (see, for example, Makedonski v. Bulgaria, no. 36036/04, § 39, 20 January 2011 ). In principle, a ban on leaving the country is a minimally intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty. However, it is evident that a travel ban imposed on a non-resident of the country where the proceedings take place has more serious consequences on the effective enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life than that imposed on a resident. While a resident can go on about his daily life and resume social and professional activities without significant difficulties during the period the travel ban is enforced, a non - resident whose life has been established elsewhere will suffer a major disruption in their private and professional lives. Therefore, it is all the more necessary for such measure to be justified on the basis of an individualised approach from the outset and throughout its duration. Accordingly, the domestic authorities reviewing the measure should take account of all the factors involved by means of a periodic and individual assessment (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener, cited above, § 124). An automatic blanket ban imposed on an individual without an assessment of the fair balance test falls foul of the procedural obligations of the State inherent in Article 8 of the Convention."

                "93. In the present case, the Court notes that the travel ban was imposed on the second applicant after he was released from pre-trial detention, that is on 21 January 2003, as a preventive measure in lieu of detention. On that date he was prohibited from leaving Turkey until 25 December 2006, when his conviction for membership of a terrorist organisation became final. The travel ban was lifted on 24 June 2009 on his request, after he had served his sentence. During the proceedings, the second applicant made seven applications to the domestic courts requesting that the ban be lifted, explaining each time that the measure in question prevented him from maintaining his personal and professional ties to Germany, where he resided, and asking the courts to put in place a more appropriate measure, such as bail. The courts either failed to examine them or replied to those applications each time by merely referring to the stage the proceedings were at, without making any assessment as to whether the continuing restriction, after a certain lapse of time, was still a proportionate measure in the individual circumstances of the case (see paragraph 31 above). Since the domestic courts ’ decisions contain no consideration in relation to the applicant ’ s non-resident status and the profound implications of the travel ban on his private and professional life, it cannot be said that they weighed up the competing interests at stake. They therefore failed to provide sufficient justification for the continued ban on the applicant ’ s travelling abroad which, the Court recalls, lasted almost four years."

On 13 January 2012 the Ljubljana District Court, by means of a judgment, joined the three above-mentioned prison sentences, including the one for robbery which the applicant had already completed, in an overall sentence. Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years ’ imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years ’ imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years ’ imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that “[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent [ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality”."

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court ’ s judgment, pointing out that the latter court ’ s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un - amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case was thirty years."

In 1999 an amendment ( Official Gazette no. 23/1999, KZ-A – hereinafter “the 1999 Amendment” ) to the Criminal Code introduced a maximum term of thirty years ’ imprisonment for the most serious criminal offences committed with intent, such as certain categories of murder.

The Supreme Court also expressed an opinion that the requirement of applying the more lenient sentence should not be used when determining the overall sentence. The Constitutional Court by its decision no. Up-200/13 of 23 October 2014 found the above position incompatible with Article 28 of the Constitution, which, in the Constitutional Court ’ s view, required that when setting the overall sentence the court should use the penal law applicable at the time when the last offence considered in the overall sentence had been committed or a subsequent law if it was more lenient."

I Ips 58203/2011 was concerned with a case in which one of the sentences that were being combined amounted to thirty years ’ imprisonment. This is why the court in this case departed exceptionally from the semantic ( jezikovne ) interpretation of Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code and gave priority to historical, systemic and logical interpretation. The situation is different when the convicted person has had individual sentences imposed on him or her which do not exceed twenty years ’ imprisonment. Such was a situation in the present case and in the case decided by the Supreme Court ’ s judgment no. I Ips 21381/2011. In these cases the overall sentence cannot exceed twenty years. In this connection, the Supreme Court has taken into account the legal dogmatics which made it clear that semantic interpretation is the main method of interpretation. The possible meaning of the text of the legislation sets the outer limits, which cannot be overstepped by other methods of interpretation ... Such a limit on the interpretation of legal norms stems from the separation of powers (Article 3 of the Constitution) and the principle that the courts are bound by the Constitution and statutes (Article 125 of the Constitution). In the framework of criminal law it further stems from the principle of legality ...",

The second and the third judgment concerned offences committed before the applicant had started serving the term of imprisonment of four years imposed by the first judgment and the courts were therefore required under domestic law to determine one overall sentence for all three criminal offences (see paragraphs 13 and 22 above ). As they had not done so, the applicant, on 28 November 2011, applied to have an overall sentence determined under the provisions concerning the so - called irregular reopening of proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above).

There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was entitled to the determination of the overall sentence under the 2008 Criminal Code, which had been in force when his last conviction had become final as well as when the judgment imposing the overall sentence had been given (see paragraphs 13, 22 and 25 above).

                "56. The Court considers that the above situation, which was acknowledged by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 13, 16 and 26 above ) as well as the Government (see paragraph 42 above), contravened the principle of legality, by which the requirement that a penalty must be clearly defined in law is an essential part (see paragraphs 46 to 48 above). It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so. The Court notes in this connection that while the courts were certainly the best placed to interpret and apply domestic law, they were at the same time bound by the principle, embodied in Article 7 of the Convention, that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 105). It finds that the only way for the courts to have ensured the observance of this principle and to mitigate the effects of the law ’ s unpredictability in the present case would have been to interpret the deficient provision restrictively, that is to say to the advantage of the applicant."

                "57. In this regard, the Court observes that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code could be applied to the applicant by either disregarding the lower limit, pursuant to which the overall sentence should have exceeded each individual sentence, or by disregarding the upper limit, pursuant to which the overall prison sentence should not have exceeded the maximum ceiling of twenty years. It is clear from the foregoing that the more favourable to the applicant would have been the first option, which, most importantly, would have complied with the maximum limit on the overall sentence explicitly provided in the legislation (see paragraph 22 above) and thus avoided filling the legislative lacuna by way of extensive judicial interpretation."

                "58. Yet the domestic courts found that a term of imprisonment of thirty years, instead of twenty years, should be set as the overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case. In justifying their conclusion they had regard to, inter alia, other penalties set out in the 2008 Criminal Code; the overall sentence of thirty years ’ imprisonment set out in the ( then no longer valid ) 1994 Criminal Code; the purpose of the overall sentence; and the legislature ’ s intent which, in the Supreme Court ’ s view, had been later realised in the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 26. above)."

                "59. The Court therefore notes that the domestic courts interpreted the deficient legal provisions by resorting to different canons of interpretation and thereby coming to the conclusion that it should be understood as imposing a sentence of thirty years. They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention. It further finds that the overall penalty imposed on the applicant was in violation of both the principle that only the law can prescribe a penalty and the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law."

The present case cannot thus be compared to Del Río Prada where the applicant ’ s continued detention was in breach of Article 5 § 1 and she had had to serve a heavier penalty than the one that had been imposed, in disregard of Article 7 of the Convention ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 145 )."
