In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue."

Listing the various risks to which the site exposed the public, the report specifically referred to the danger of an explosion due to methanogenesis, as the tip had “no means of preventing an explosion of methane occurring as a result of the decomposition” of household waste (see paragraph 13 above)."

However, the Court considers that those steps are more indicative of a conflict of powers between different authorities, or indeed delaying tactics. In any event, the proceedings to have the report set aside were in fact abortive, having not been pursued by the councils’ lawyers, and the report was never declared invalid. On the contrary, it was decisive for all the authorities responsible for investigating the accident of 28 April 1993 and, moreover, was subsequently confirmed by the report of 18 May 1993 by the committee of experts appointed by the Üsküdar public prosecutor (see paragraph 23 above) and by the two scientific opinions referred to in the report of 9 July 1993 by the chief inspector appointed by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 28 above)."

The Court considers that neither the reality nor the immediacy of the danger in question is in dispute, seeing that the risk of an explosion had clearly come into being long before it was highlighted in the report of 7 May 1991 and that, as the site continued to operate in the same conditions, that risk could only have increased during the period until it materialised on 28 April 1993."

Furthermore, the Court likewise regards it as established that various authorities were also aware of those risks, at least by 27 May 1991, when they were notified of the report of 7 May 1991 (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above).",

The Environment Office had called for the tip to be brought into line with the standards laid down in regulations 24 to 27 of the Regulations on Solid-Waste Control, the last-mentioned of which explicitly required the installation of a “vertical and horizontal drainage system” allowing the controlled release into the atmosphere of the accumulated gas (see paragraph 56 above)."

Seeing that this policy effectively established an amnesty for breaches of town-planning regulations, including the unlawful occupation of public property, it must have created uncertainty as to the extent of the discretion enjoyed by the administrative authorities responsible for applying the measures prescribed by law, which could not therefore have been regarded as foreseeable by the public."

On 22 January 1960 Istanbul City Council (“the city council”) had been granted use of the land, which belonged to the Forestry Commission (and therefore to the Treasury), for a term of ninety-nine years. Situated on a slope overlooking a valley, the site spread out over a surface area of approximately 35 hectares and from 1972 onwards was used as a rubbish tip by the districts of Beykoz, Üsküdar, Kadıköy and Ümraniye under the authority and responsibility of the city council and, ultimately, the ministerial authorities.",

In support of their application, M.C. and A.C. produced documents showing that they had been liable for council tax and property tax since 1977 under tax no. 168900.

Methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are the two main products of methanogenesis, which is the final and longest stage of anaerobic fermentation (that is, a process taking place in the absence of air). These substances are generated, inter alia, by the biological and chemical decomposition of waste. The risks of explosion and fire are mainly due to the large proportion of methane in the biogas. The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CH 4 in the air is between 5% and 15%. If the level rises above 15%, methane will catch fire but will not explode."

It appears from various circulars and regulations in force in the Council of Europe’s member States regarding household-waste management and the operation of municipal rubbish tips that the main priorities of the authorities and operators concerned include: isolating waste-disposal sites by ensuring that they are not located within a minimum distance of any housing; preventing the risk of landslides by creating stable embankments and dykes and using compaction techniques; and eliminating the risk of fire or biogas explosions.",
                "As regards the last-mentioned priority, the recommended method for decontaminating sites appears to entail setting up a drainage system for fermentation gases whereby gases are pumped out and treated using a biological filter as the site continues to operate. A gas-extraction system of this kind, provision for which is also made in the Regulations of 14 March 1991 in force in Turkey, generally consists of perforated vertical ducts drilled into the waste or horizontal drains buried in the mass of waste, a ventilation system, a biological filter and a network of suction pipes.",

However, the Court considers that those steps are more indicative of a conflict of powers between different authorities, or indeed delaying tactics. In any event, the proceedings to have the report set aside were in fact abortive, having not been pursued by the councils’ lawyers, and the report was never declared invalid. On the contrary, it was decisive for all the authorities responsible for investigating the accident of 28 April 1993 and, moreover, was subsequently confirmed by the report of 18 May 1993 by the committee of experts appointed by the Üsküdar public prosecutor (see paragraph 23 above) and by the two scientific opinions referred to in the report of 9 July 1993 by the chief inspector appointed by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 28 above)."

The Environment Office had called for the tip to be brought into line with the standards laid down in regulations 24 to 27 of the Regulations on Solid-Waste Control, the last-mentioned of which explicitly required the installation of a “vertical and horizontal drainage system” allowing the controlled release into the atmosphere of the accumulated gas (see paragraph 56 above)."

No such recognition had ever been forthcoming under domestic law, either explicitly or tacitly, and the Government observed that the applicant had, moreover, been unable to produce any documents or title deeds in support of his claims.

Poland, no. 34049/96, § 63, ECHR 2001-VI).

In the first place, the criminal proceedings were conducted in such a way that the focus was shifted from the all-important life-endangering aspect of the case to a determination of whether or not the mayors could be held liable for “negligence in the performance of their duties”.

The Government observed that neither the Convention nor its case-law compelled the authorities to secure the conviction of a defendant. The Chamber’s suggestion that the verdict handed down against the mayors was tantamount to granting them almost total impunity had ignored both this point and the national authorities’ discretion to classify criminal charges in the light of the circumstances of a particular case, including situations like the one obtaining in the present case, where the applicant had never complained that the mayors were guilty of unlawful killing through negligence."

The Government further contended that, contrary to the Chamber’s finding, the compensation claim had been determined within a reasonable time, and certainly within a much shorter time-frame than, for example, in Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), where the Court had found that the period of six years and three months taken to determine a civil claim for death by negligence could not be said to raise an issue under Article 2.

As to the alleged loss resulting from the destruction of the applicant’s dwelling, the Court observes at the outset that, in the absence of any substantiation, the sum claimed would appear excessive. In this connection, it considers that the economic interest which the subsidised housing acquired by the applicant may have represented should be taken into account in the assessment of damage (see paragraph 156 above), although this task is complicated both by the constant fluctuation in the rates of exchange and inflation in Turkey and by the transactions carried out by the applicant in relation to his flat (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Chamber’s assessment was based on the assumption that the value of the applicant’s dwelling that was destroyed amounted to 50% of the cost of decent housing offered at the time by Istanbul City Council in the Çobançeşme area. The Grand Chamber notes in this connection that, according to a list drawn up on 20 March 2001 by the city council, the council was offering housing in the Çobançeşme area for approximately TRL 10,400,000,000, which on that date was equivalent to EUR 11,800.",
                "That information apart, the Court observes, again on the basis of its own – inevitably approximate – calculations, that on 13 November 1993, when the contract for the sale of the flat to the applicant was signed, the agreed price of TRL 125,000,000 was equivalent to approximately EUR 8,500, a quarter of which (EUR 2,125) was paid immediately. The remainder (equivalent to EUR 6,375) was to be paid in 120 monthly instalments of TRL 732,844. On 13 November 1993 the monthly instalments were equivalent to approximately EUR 53. However, on 24 March 1998, the date on which the applicant promised to sell his flat to E.B., the instalments corresponded to only EUR 3. According to calculations on the basis of the exchange rates in force between 13 November 1993 and 24 March 1998, the average value of the instalments was EUR 15. As there is no reason to believe that the applicant continued to pay the instalments after 24 March 1998, it can be presumed that by that date he must have paid, in addition to the down payment, the equivalent of approximately EUR 780 in monthly instalments towards the purchase of the flat, making a total of approximately EUR 3,000, which is significantly lower than the initial value of the flat.",
                "It should also be borne in mind that from at least February 1995 onwards, if not well before that date, the flat in question had been let to a certain H.Ö. for a monthly rent of TRL 2,000,000 (approximately EUR 41). In the thirty ‑ seven months during which the flat was leased, ending on 24 March 1998 when the undertaking to sell it was signed, the applicant must therefore have received a minimum of approximately EUR 1,500 in rent, whereas during the same period he had had to pay only EUR 550 in monthly instalments.",
                "Furthermore, on signing the undertaking to sell the flat, the applicant received 20,000 German marks from E.B.; that sum, equivalent at the time to EUR 10,226, is significantly higher than any amount the applicant would ultimately have had to spend on the purchase of his flat.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, assuming that the market value of the applicant’s slum dwelling may be estimated according to the criterion adopted by the Chamber and that he must have spent a certain amount on accommodation while his flat was being let out, there is still no reason for the Court to conclude that those circumstances resulted in a loss greater than the profit the applicant seems to have made from the transactions relating to his flat.",

In making that award, however, the court refused to take into account any electrical appliances allegedly owned by the applicant, on the ground that his dwelling did not have electricity (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the compensation awarded has never been paid to the applicant.

                "In the Court ’ s view, such considerations are indisputably valid in the context of dangerous activities, when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, which are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused such incidents.",
                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",
                "95. That said, the requirements of Article 2 go beyond the stage of the official investigation, where this has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. ”",

            [
                "9. Composite fuel, also known as composite propellant, is a broad class of solid chemical fuels that are used as propellants in rockets. The rocket-fuel sheets resemble PVC folia but are less stable and require a specialised location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions. They are composed of fuel and oxidiser. An example of a fuel is phenol formaldehyde and of an oxidiser, ammonium perchlorate (“AP”). AP is a powerful oxidiser, which explains why it is used mainly in solid propellant rocket boosters, including space shuttles and military missiles."
            ],
            [
                "10. AP is a white, granular, crystalline solid or powder. Its explosive characteristics depend on particle size and granulometric composition. It is a class 4 oxidiser (it can cause an explosive reaction) when particles measure over 15 micrometres. It is classified as an explosive when particles measure less than 15 micrometres. It has been apparently involved in a number of accidents. AP is stable when properly stored, transported and handled at temperatures below 150 degrees Celsius ( oC). The amount put in any pile must be limited and storage sites must be designed with blast walls. The risks of explosion and fire associated with AP arise mainly when there is a large proportion of AP in a premix or when it is exposed to intensive heat or an organic compound. When heated to 300 oC, AP degrades organic adhesive, breaking cemented joints. Complete reactions leave no residue."

They were requested to examine the scene two to three steps away from the entrance door for security reasons, given that the damaged roof could have collapsed. The judge noticed that it had been a powerful explosion, and that the production room had been covered in dust and pieces of the roof, which also prevented a good overview of the room.",

He had to wait thirty minutes for the director to be found and to finish his telephone call with the Belgrade mayor, N.Č. The director stated that the explosion had occurred when the factory ’ s experts with a team of additional experts (part of the statement is illegible ) had apparently tested a new product - manufacturing process with which he was not familiar. However, he clarified that the manufacturing process required special security measures and teams, and named all of the factory ’ s experts involved, including the applicant ’ s son as a chief engineer. The technical director, S.K., stated that his team of between seventeen and twenty employees had been testing a new product and that experts from other companies and faculties “might have been involved” in the manufacturing process that afternoon. Presuming that ten people had died, he anticipated that the cause of the explosion may have been “an unwanted, unexpected and unknown chemical reaction which had ‘ broken out ’ during the process”.",

While acknowledging that the obligation to investigate had evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding a State even when an alleged death had taken place before the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that State, the Government contended that the Court, nonetheless, had temporal jurisdiction to examine only those events which had occurred following the ratification date. However, according to the Government, the facts of this case showed that the alleged violation of the applicant ’ s right had originated in events which had taken place before 3 March 2004, namely the date on which the Convention had entered into force in respect of Serbia (“the ratification date”)."

The Government maintained that none of the elements of a “genuine connection” between the impugned death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia had been established in order for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. Firstly, whereas in the Šilih case the short lapse of time (one year) between the death of the applicant ’ s son and the acceptance by Slovenia of the right of individual petition was a crucial element, the fatal accident that had triggered the investigation in the present case took place nine years before the ratification date. Furthermore, and contrary to the Court ’ s position in numerous post- Šilih cases in which a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision were, or should have been, carried out after ratification, the public investigation at issue was carried out and terminated before the critical date. The Government stressed that although the criminal prosecution pursued by the applicant had continued beyond the ratification date, the applicant had not requested the reopening of the investigation. The competent authorities could not have initiated another ex officio investigation or resumed the prosecution after the initial investigation had been terminated and the applicant had already taken over the prosecution in the capacity of a “ subsidiary prosecutor ”. The Government therefore opined that the applicant ’ s complaint should be rejected by the Court as incompatible with the Convention ratione temporis."

                "(a) The State ’ s procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding a State regardless of whether the death, as a triggering event, took place before or after the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that State (see Šilih, cited above, §§ 159 and 162, and Velcea and Mazăre v. Romania, no. 64301/01, § 81, 1 December 2009 ).",
                "(b) However, bearing in mind the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended.",
                "(i) Firstly, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. The reference to “procedural acts” must be understood in the sense inherent in the procedural obligation under Article 2, namely, acts undertaken in the framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible or to an award of compensation to the injured party. The word “omissions” refers to a situation where there has been no investigation or where only insignificant procedural steps have been carried out, but where it is alleged that an effective investigation ought to have taken place (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, §§ 142-44, ECHR 2013 ).",
                "(ii) Furthermore, there must be a “genuine connection” between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. That means, in practice, that in order for a “genuine connection” to be established, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State must have been reasonably short (in principle, not exceeding ten years) and most of the investigative steps required by this provision must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the Convention ’ s entry into force (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, § 206, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Janowiec, cited above, §§ 146-48).",

Explicitly, where a preliminary investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law (see, as an original authority, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 96; see also Mladenović, cited above, §§ 39 and 53-54 )."

While the death and the preliminary investigative measures indeed took place before 3 March 2004, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia is not excessively long. Various procedural acts were undertaken in the framework of the impugned criminal proceedings over a period of over twelve years after the critical date, notably a criminal trial.

However, for reasons of context and whilst examining the situation complained of as a whole, the Court may also take note of all relevant events prior to that date (see, in the context of Article 2, Mladenović, cited above, § 5 2, and, in the context of Article 3, Milanović v.

As already noted above, Serbia ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004 and the official investigation into the incident had ended by 2003. In view of the absence of a pending investigation after the ratification date, the alleged events could not be of a continuing nature. According to the Government, the six-month time-limit had started to run as soon as the right to individual application to the Court had become available in Serbia.

When the trial commenced, he could reasonably expect that a more effective investigation and a more logical analysis would eventually be carried out by the judicial authorities, in view of the controversial death of his son and the prior investigative conclusions, which had been highly questionable. However, the applicant decided not to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings, but rather to lodge an application with the Court after this complex case restarted before the new chamber in 2007. He did so as he had begun to suspect that the trial was being obstructed and with the intention of accelerating it."

The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is, inter alia, to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6638/03, 2 4 August 2004). That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State ’ s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court ’ s own examination of the case. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Mocanu, cited above, § 262, with further references )."

That being said, the Court does not consider it appropriate to indicate general time-frames, as the issue of identifying the exact point in time that this stage occurs is difficult to determine with precision and depends, unavoidably, on the circumstances of each case and on other factors, such as the diligence shown by the applicants, the adequacy of the remedy and the global nature of the lapse of time (see, for the aspects of diligence, the decision in Nasirkhayeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 1721/07, 31 May 2011; see also Eren v. Turkey (dec.), no. 42428/98, 4 July 2002 ). In principle, the Court has qualified its previous case-law in cases of unlawful or violent death by requiring the applicant to bring such a case to the Court within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a few years after the events in question (see Varnava and Others, § 162 ). Stricter expectations would apply in cases where there was a complete absence of any investigation or progress in an investigation, or meaningful contact with the authorities. Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, or where a criminal prosecution is being pursued, even by the relatives themselves, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait longer for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues ( ibid ., §166 ). It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention."

Applying those principles to the facts of the present case, the Court notes firstly that on 12 June 2000, after preliminary investigative measures had been undertaken, the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute anyone on the grounds that no elements of any offence had been established which would be prosecuted ex officio. The Court accepts that in certain cases the six - month period may start running on the date when the applicants are informed that the national authorities are unable or unwilling to institute criminal proceedings in relation to their complaints (see Aydın v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 28293/95, 29494/95 and 30219 /96, ECHR 2000 ‑ III (extracts)). However, shortly after receiving such information, the applicant notified the competent criminal court that he intended to take over the prosecution by lodging a request for further investigative steps to be undertaken. On 8 April 2003, the applicant was informed that following his request the investigation had been terminated and that the public prosecutor was not interested in resuming the prosecution of the matter; however, he was informed that he could file an indictment if he so wished. Indeed, on 22 April 2003 the applicant continued to pursue a subsidiary prosecution by filing a bill of indictment against certain individuals. Where a national system allows the possibility for the victim ’ s family to take over the prosecution of the case on their own behalf, such post-ratification proceedings must also be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month time-limit (see paragraph 99 above)."

Despite the fact that certain documents from the preliminary investigation were not available to the applicant, the beginning of the criminal trial in May 2004, which is a potentially adequate remedy, must have raised his expectations of yet obtaining redress (see Mladenović, cited above) and he acted reasonably in awaiting developments in the criminal proceedings."

Although there were adjournments and lulls in the judicial activity in this case, there were no periods of total inactivity allowing the Court to establish the date on which the applicant was or could have been aware that the remedies had become ineffective, given that he had consistently displayed the requisite interest in obtaining a concrete result and had continued his efforts by pursuing a subsidiary prosecution (see, by contrast, Gasyak and Others v. Turkey, no. 27872/03, § 58, 13 October 2009, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009). The Court therefore accepts that the applicant, as he himself argued, must have started to doubt that the criminal prosecution was not progressing in February 2007 when the trial again recommenced before a new chamber. This relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant could or should already have been aware, more than six months before he lodged the application on 3 August 2007, that the criminal proceedings which were under way would not elucidate the situation, also having in mind that the court heard some of the crucial figures in this case and, moreover, rendered a first-instance judgment after February 2007."

In addition to the said finding of a violation, it ordered the competent courts to bring the impugned criminal proceedings to a conclusion as soon as possible and declared that the applicant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 6 7 above ).

Secondly, the Court may, in principle, accept a lower award of compensation by the domestic authorities than it would award itself, judged in the light of the standard of living in the State concerned.

He had been hoping that the liability for his son ’ s death would be established, but the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than eleven years, during which time the domestic courts had failed to elucidate the circumstances surrounding the accident.

The State could not have re-initiated an ex officio investigation once the applicant had already taken over the prosecution of the case in his capacity as a subsidiary prosecutor. Referring to the arguments raised in respect of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction (see paragraphs 91-93 above), the Government reiterated their view that the investigation could not therefore fall under the Court ’ s jurisdiction.

The obligation on the part of the State to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction has been interpreted so as to include both substantive and procedural aspects, notably a positive obligation to ensure that any occurrence of death caused by a life-threatening emergency would be followed by a judicial enquiry (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89-118)."

                "“89. The positive obligation to take all appropriate steps to safeguard life for the purposes of Article 2 (see paragraph 71 above) entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54; İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 91, ECHR 2000-VII; Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 62, ECHR 2000-III; and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 85, ECHR 2000-III).",
                "91. Where lives have been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State, that provision entails a duty for the State to ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response – judicial or otherwise – so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54).",
                "92. In this connection, the Court has held that if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation to set up an ‘ effective judicial system ’ does not necessarily require criminal proceedings to be brought in every case and may be satisfied if civil, administrative or even disciplinary remedies were available to the victims (see, for example, Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, § 90, ECHR 2004-VIII; Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 51; and Mastromatteo, cited above, §§ 90 and 94-95).",

However, in areas such as that in issue in the instant case, the applicable principles are rather to be found in those the Court has already had occasion to develop in relation notably to the use of lethal force, principles which lend themselves to application in other categories of cases.",
                "In this connection, it should be pointed out that in cases of homicide the interpretation of Article 2 as entailing an obligation to conduct an official investigation is justified not only because any allegations of such an offence normally give rise to criminal liability (see Caraher v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24520/94, ECHR 2000-I), but also because often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death are, or may be, largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 47 ‑ 49, §§ 157-64, and İlhan, cited above, § 91).",
                "In the Court ’ s view, such considerations are indisputably valid in the context of dangerous activities, when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, which are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused such incidents.",
                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",
                "95. That said, the requirements of Article 2 go beyond the stage of the official investigation, where this has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. ”",

Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum (see Binişan v.

It also places a duty on the State and/or local government authorities, as appropriate, to set up supervision mechanisms.

In the present case, it has not been established yet domestically whether or not there had been any negligence attributable to State officials or bodies which goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 93, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above); neither is the Court ’ s role to determine whether there was a causal connection between any failure on the side of the individuals or the State authorities and the accident, nor to reach any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense. However, given that the Government did not contend that the matter could have been effectively pursued outside the framework of criminal proceedings, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the measures taken in the framework of the proceedings instituted by the applicant within the Serbian criminal-law system, and within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction, were satisfactory in practice (see, in this respect, Öneryıldız and Henriques Pereira, both cited above). As mentioned above, the assessment of whether the domestic authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention when confronted with an arguable case of negligence causing deprivation of lives extends to the criminal trial (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 95, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above)."

The commission consisted of officers of the Security Institute and the two co-owners of the company JPL Systems, who, while sitting in private, published the report eight months later (see paragraphs 19-20; see also paragraphs 30, 36 and 64 above for the other experts ’ comments on the report ). The Court has not received other documents on the authorities ’ attempt to collect evidence from the accident scene, apart from the autopsy reports and the initial on-site inspection reports.",

An expert report was provided in May 1998 (see paragraph 30 above). The witnesses and those assigned by the applicant as suspects were heard between November 1998 and October 1999. The State Intelligence Service executives were heard in 1999-2000 and their statements were thereafter classified as State secret by the investigating judge (see paragraph 32 above). On 12 June 2000 the prosecutor decided not to further investigate or to prosecute (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has not received the prosecutor ’ s decision, if it was made in writing.",

The competent judicial authorities refused to open an investigation, having established that the rocket fuel had been produced at the request of the State Intelligence Service and the then Serbian President (see paragraphs 36-38 above). After the Supreme Court ’ s referral of the case back for further investigation and the District Court ’ s warning of the procedural defects in handling the case (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above), the investigating judge opened the investigation for another year to hear the five suspects and provide another report on the cause of the accident.

Given that the criminal trial is still under way, the issue to be assessed is not whether the judicial authorities, as the guardians of the laws laid down to protect lives, were determined to sanction those responsible, if appropriate (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 112 and 11 5), but whether the judicial authorities proceed with exemplary diligence and promptness. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an alleged infringements of the right to life may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Hugh Jordan, cited above, §§ 108 and 136-140; McCaughey, cited above, § 130; and Hemsworth, cited above, § 69)."

During that time, one of the accused has died (see paragraph 61 above). Only nine hearings were held while a total of twenty-one hearings were cancelled or adjourned by the competent courts for various procedural reasons. The Court observes that there were several long periods of unexplained inactivity and, moreover, that the trial recommenced before new chambers on six occasions either because of changes on the bench or because such delays in proceedings call for a fresh trial (see paragraphs 54, 56-57 and 59-61 above).

The present case was a matter of considerable political and pressing public sensitivity in which, the Court concedes, there may have been obstructiveness deployed by various sides in order to prevent progress in an investigation. However, the sensitive nature of the case and the obstacles are less an excuse for delay than a further reason for the State to have organised its judicial system to overcome the earlier defects and omissions by the prompt and diligent establishment of the facts at the criminal trial and to have brought those responsible to justice, if any, in order to avoid or disprove any appearance of a cover-up (see McKerr, cited above, and Dimitrov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 77938/11, § 148, 1 July 2014 ). In addition, even if a prosecution is brought and suspects stand trial, the Court will examine whether this is a “meaningful” or serious exercise with any realistic prospects of bringing the perpetrator to account (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, §§ 231, 250 and 251, ECHR 2005 ‑ II (extracts). Violations have also been found where the trial had continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending) or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see, mutatis mutandis, Teren Aksakal v.

In that regard, the Court would stress that the passage of time inevitably erodes the amount and quality of evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence casts doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts (see Trubnikov v. Russia, no. 49790/99, § 92, 5 July 2005 ). Moreover, the very passage of time is liable to compromise definitely the chances of investigation being completed (see M.B. v.

The Court considers that in Article 2 cases concerning proceedings instituted to elucidate the circumstances of an individual ’ s death, lengthy proceedings such as those are a strong indication that the proceedings were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State ’ s procedural obligations under the Convention, unless the State has provided highly convincing and plausible reasons to justify such a course of proceedings (see Šilih, cited above, § 203). Indeed, in the present case, the Government have failed to show any reason justifying such lengthy proceedings following the ratification date (compare to Mladenović, Blečić above, § 54, where the post-ratification eight-year long proceedings had been mostly concerned with the assessment of evidence, as argued by the Government, and remained unclear as to why there was still no final acquittal or conviction in the case)."

Greece, judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 20, § 59). However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 16-18, §§ 34-36).

As to the conduct of the first tier appeal courts, the Government pointed out that the fact that there appeared to have been no activity from 24 August 2000 to 13 January 2003 was due to the following. The Administrative Court in question was a small unit with only one Judge, who unexpectedly had gone on sick leave for a couple of months. When he had subsequently returned to work, he had been assigned to replace the President of the District Court. The work situation had accordingly been extremely difficult. During this time two temporary Judges had been appointed to hold the office of the Administrative Court Judge. However, the first temporary Judge had been specialising in tax law and the subsequent temporary Judge had been a prosecutor. It had been difficult and time-consuming to find a temporary Judge with due knowledge of the Swedish language. As to the proceedings in that court, the Government pointed out that it had held an inspection and a hearing. Taking into account the difficult circumstances, the time it had taken for the court to examine the case was not excessive. As to the Supreme Administrative Court, it had acted with due diligence.

The Health Board had failed repeatedly to comply with the courts ’ decisions, although the situation had been explained to representatives of the Health Board already in 1995 when they had sought legal advice.

In fact, they have informally learnt that this had been precisely the reason for the Health Board ’ s decision to comply, at least partly, and for the first time in years, with the judicial decisions. The applicants made reference to the case of Hornsby v.

It could also take into account changes in the circumstances which had occurred after the court ’ s decision. In addition, the authority had a reasonable time to choose the most suitable means to give effect to the decision concerned (see Hornsby v. Greece, cited above, p. 511-512, § 43). After this case had been returned to the Health Board for the first time, it had rendered the following decisions: On 9 September 1993 it ordered the neighbours to provide the dog yard with walls and to build a separate yard to be used by puppies. On 24 August 1995 it decided that no measures had to be taken as there was no nuisance. The official reporting on the case made a reservation to the decision. On 22 January 1998 the Health Board held an inspection and noted that the walls had been altered. On 27 January 2000 it upheld its previous decision as there were no new facts in the case. On 14 August 2003 it ordered that the walls be altered. On 10 June 2004 it approved a proposal to rebuild the walls. On 12 August 2004 it found that the existing dog yard must not be used. In June 1995 the second applicant admitted that the dogs had not caused any health hazard, which apparently resulted in the Health Board ’ s decision of 24 August 1995 not to take any measures. The Health Board had not given as detailed orders as requested and it had refused to indicate time-limits.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Philis v. Greece, judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 20, § 59). However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 16-18, §§ 34-36).

By lodging an appeal with the State ’ s highest administrative court the litigant seeks not only annulment of the impugned decision but also and above all the removal of its effects. The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities ’ part to comply with a judgment of that court. The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice. Where an administrative authority refuses or fails to comply, or even delays doing so, the guarantees under Article 6 enjoyed by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose."

The claim brought by the second applicant must be rejected as he was never an owner of the property, which up until the mid 1990s was owned by the estate and thereafter by the first applicant.

According to the applicants, the rental activities had generated an annual gross income of EUR 5,000-9,000 when the property had been rented out during 20 per cent of the year and they estimated that had there been no private nuisance the property could have been rented out during 70-80 per cent of the year.

The Court recalls that Article 8 has been found to apply where the dangerous effects of an activity to which the individuals concerned were likely to be exposed established a sufficiently close link with private and family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention (see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, § 189, cited above ). In that case, the Court recognised that the potential risks to the environment caused by the construction and operation of two liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminals established a sufficiently close link with the applicant ’ s private live and home for the purposes of Article 8 and thereby triggered the application of that provision ( see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, § 192, cited above)."

However, the Court must establish, in the absence of direct evidence of actual damage to the applicant ’ s health, whether the potential risks to the environment caused by the cemetery ’ s location established a close link with the applicant ’ s private life and home sufficient to affect his “quality of life” and to trigger the application of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraphs 78 – 8 1 above)."

                "83. The Court notes that the domestic environmental health and sanitary regulations clearly prohibited placing the cemetery in close proximity to residential buildings and water sources (see paragraphs 6 7 to 72 above). It appears that the nearest boundary of the cemetery is situated 38 metres away from the applicant ’ s house (see paragraph 3 3 above). This cannot be regarded as a minor irregularity but as a rather serious breach of domestic regulations given that the actual distance is just over one tenth of the minimum distance permissible by those rules. Furthermore, the cemetery is a continuous source of possible health hazards and the potential damage caused by such is not easily reversible or preventable. Such environmental dangers have been acknowledged by the authorities on numerous occasions, including, by prohibiting the use of the illegal cemetery for burials and by the offer to resettle the applicant (see paragraphs 20 – 25 and 49 above). It further notes that the domestic authorities established that the construction of a cemetery at the said location placed the applicant at risk of contamination of the soil and of the drinking and irrigation water sources because of emanations from decomposing bodies like ptomaine (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has particular regard to the fact that there was no centralised water supply in the Tatariv village and villagers used their own wells (see paragraph 9 above). It also appears that the high level of E. coli found in the drinking water of the applicant ’ s well was far in excess of permitted levels and may have emanated from the cemetery (see paragraphs 1 2, 1 8 and 3 0 above), although the technical reports came to no definitive or unanimous conclusion as to the true source of E. coli contamination (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, the high level of E. coli, regardless of its origin, coupled with clear and blatant violation of environmental health safety regulations confirmed the existence of environmental risks, in particular, of serious water pollution, to which the applicant was exposed."

Under such circumstances, the Court concludes that the construction and use of the cemetery so close to the applicant ’ s house with the consequent impact on the environment and the applicant ’ s “quality of life ” reached the minimum level required by Article 8 and constituted an interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home and private and family life. It also considers that the interference, being potentially harmful, attained a sufficient degree of seriousness to trigger the application of Article 8 of the Convention."

                "88. Environmental pollution may affect individuals ’ well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health. The Court notes that the allegations of environmental harm in the instant case do not, as such, relate to the State ’ s involvement in industrial pollution ( see, in the context of serious industrial pollution, Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, § 73, cited above ). However, they concern allegations of health hazards arising from the local authority ’ s decision to locate a cemetery just 38 meters from the applicant ’ s home in breach of domestic regulations plus the State ’ s failure to act in securing compliance with the domestic environmental standards. The allegations also concern the State ’ s failure to regulate the activities of the municipality in line with such standards. The Court ’ s task in such a situation is to assess whether the State took all reasonable measures to secure the protection of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In making such an assessment factors, including compliance with the domestic environmental regulations and judicial decisions, must be analysed in the context of a given case (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, cited above, § 141 ). In particular, where domestic environmental regulations exist, a breach of Article 8 may be established where there is a failure to comply with such regulations (see Moreno Gómez v. Spain, cited above, §§ 56 and 61)."

As the Court has noted in a number of its judgments, Article 8 has been relied on in various cases in which environmental concerns are raised (see, among many other authorities, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). However, in order to raise an issue under Article 8 the interference about which the applicant complains must directly affect his home, family or private life and must attain a certain minimum level if the complaints are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C; and Fadeyeva, cited above, § 69-70). Therefore, the first point for decision is whether the environmental pollution of which the applicant complains can be regarded as affecting adversely, to a sufficient extent, the enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life (see Ivan Atanasov v. Bulgaria, no. 12853/03, § 66, 2 December 2010 ). In this respect, the Court recalls that water pollution was one of the factors which was found to affect the applicants ’ health and hence their ability to enjoy their home, private and family life in the case of Dubetska and Others v.

As a basis for the analysis it may use, for instance, domestic legal provisions determining unsafe levels of pollution and environmental studies commissioned by the authorities. Special attention will be paid by the Court to individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to an applicant ’ s particular situation, such as an undertaking to revoke a polluter ’ s operating licence or to resettle a resident away from a polluted area. However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially when they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such a situation it has to assess the evidence in its entirety. Further sources of evidence for consideration in addition to the applicant ’ s personal accounts of events, will include, for instance, his medical certificates as well as relevant reports, statements or studies made by private entities (see Dubetska and Others v.

In that case, the Court recognised that the potential risks to the environment caused by the construction and operation of two liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminals established a sufficiently close link with the applicant ’ s private live and home for the purposes of Article 8 and thereby triggered the application of that provision ( see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, § 192, cited above)."

It appears that the nearest boundary of the cemetery is situated 38 metres away from the applicant ’ s house (see paragraph 3 3 above). This cannot be regarded as a minor irregularity but as a rather serious breach of domestic regulations given that the actual distance is just over one tenth of the minimum distance permissible by those rules. Furthermore, the cemetery is a continuous source of possible health hazards and the potential damage caused by such is not easily reversible or preventable. Such environmental dangers have been acknowledged by the authorities on numerous occasions, including, by prohibiting the use of the illegal cemetery for burials and by the offer to resettle the applicant (see paragraphs 20 – 25 and 49 above). It further notes that the domestic authorities established that the construction of a cemetery at the said location placed the applicant at risk of contamination of the soil and of the drinking and irrigation water sources because of emanations from decomposing bodies like ptomaine (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has particular regard to the fact that there was no centralised water supply in the Tatariv village and villagers used their own wells (see paragraph 9 above). It also appears that the high level of E. coli found in the drinking water of the applicant ’ s well was far in excess of permitted levels and may have emanated from the cemetery (see paragraphs 1 2, 1 8 and 3 0 above), although the technical reports came to no definitive or unanimous conclusion as to the true source of E. coli contamination (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, the high level of E. coli, regardless of its origin, coupled with clear and blatant violation of environmental health safety regulations confirmed the existence of environmental risks, in particular, of serious water pollution, to which the applicant was exposed."

The Court ’ s task in such a situation is to assess whether the State took all reasonable measures to secure the protection of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

Since 1974 Valencia City Council (“the City Council”) has allowed licensed premises, such as bars, pubs and discotheques, to open in the vicinity of his home. In view of the problems caused by the noise, the City Council resolved on 22 December 1983 not to permit any more licensed premises to open in the area. However, the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted. In 1993, the Polytechnic University of Valencia carried out a study of the levels of night - time noise during the weekend on behalf of the City Council. It was reported that in the San José district the noise levels were notably higher to the legally accepted norm."

He also asked for the withdrawal of the business licences of several establishments. The City Council replied that in fact no business activities were being carried out in some of the premises, and that the business activities carried out in the others could not be considered as producing a high level of noise ( for example bakeries). Lastly, the licences had in any case expired in many of the establishments."

Indeed, the applicant had decided to replace his windows without previously asking for a measurement of the noise inside his flat, as provided by Article 54 of the Ordinance.

Firstly, the City authorities had already designated the area in which the applicant lived an acoustically saturated zone, which, within the meaning of the Ordinance, meant an area in which local residents were exposed to high noise levels which caused them serious disturbance. Secondly, those high noise levels have continued for several years after the declaration of the district as an acoustically saturated zone, as confirmed by the official reports provided by the City Council services in 1998 and 2000 ( see paragraphs 12 and 13 above ). Indeed, that fact has been confirmed by the Government, who acknowledged that several years after the applicant ’ s claim the volume of the noise was 35 dBA in the applicant ’ s neighbour ’ s flat, above the 30 dBA considered the maximum permissible level by the City Council itself (see paragraph 34 above)."

Additionally, the Court observes that, contrary to what the Government stated, the applicant, in his position as president of the neighbourhood association of his district, had lodged numerous claims against the City Council before he replaced his windows. It cannot be considered that the applicant ’ s behaviour has been abusive or disproportionate to the disturbances he was suffering.

The Court has repeatedly emphasised that the existence of a sanction system is not enough if it is not applied in a timely and effective manner (see Bor v. Hungary, no. 50474/08, § 27, 18 June 2013 ). In the present case, the decrease in the number of times that the legal dBA levels were exceeded on a daily basis and the administrative sanctions imposed by the City Council cannot be considered sufficient measures.

A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area within reasonable limits. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person's home, but may also include those that are diffuse, such as noise, emissions, smells or other similar forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person's right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home ( cf. Moreno Gómez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, § 53, ECHR 2004 ‑ X).",

It also observes that the Government did not dispute in essence that the situation had indeed been problematic after the introduction of the toll on the motorway outside Alsónémedi – although they argued that the measures implemented had alleviated the burden on the applicant to such an extent that the adverse environmental effects had been reduced and did not attain the minimum level of harm proscribed by Article 8 in this field. The Court finds noteworthy that, from 1998 onwards, the authorities constructed three bypass roads, introduced a night speed limit of 40 km/h and provided two adjacent intersections with traffic lights.

The Court considers that the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention when it comes to the determination of regulatory and other measures intended to protect Article 8 rights. This consideration also holds true in situations, which do not concern direct interference by public authorities with the right to respect for the home but involve those authorities'failure to take action to put a stop to third-party breaches of the right relied on by the applicant (cf. Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 57 ). In the present case the State was called on to balance between the interests of road-users and those of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The Court recognises the complexity of the State's tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. It observes nevertheless that the measures which were taken by the authorities consistently proved to be insufficient, as a result of which the applicant was exposed to excessive noise disturbance over a substantial period of time. The Court finds that this situation created a disproportionate individual burden for the applicant. In that respect, the Court observes that, on the basis of the expert opinion of Budapest Technical University, the domestic courts concluded that the vibration or the noise caused by the traffic was not substantial enough to cause damage to the applicant's house, but the noise exceeded the statutory level (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has already held that noise pressure significantly above statutory levels, unresponded to by appropriate State measures, may as such amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention ( cf.

In the present case, it notes that, despite the State's efforts to slow down and reorganise traffic in the neighbourhood, a situation involving substantial traffic noise in the applicant's street prevailed at least until and including May 2003 when two measuring sessions established noise values respectively 15% and 12% above the statutory ones (see paragraph 11 above) (see, a contrario, Fägerskiöld v.

In the present case, it notes that, despite the State's efforts to slow down and reorganise traffic in the neighbourhood, a situation involving substantial traffic noise in the applicant's street prevailed at least until and including May 2003 when two measuring sessions established noise values respectively 15% and 12% above the statutory ones (see paragraph 11 above) (see, a contrario, Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37664/04, ECHR 2008– ... (extracts))."

The Court recalls that in Fadeyeva it established that the Severstal steel-plant's operations did not fully comply with the environmental and health standards established in the relevant Russian legislation. The operation of the Severstal plant in conformity with the domestic legislation would be possible only if the zone, separating the enterprise from the residential areas of the town, continued to exist and served its purpose."

In that case the Court considered two alternative avenues that could have been employed by the authorities in order to solve the applicant's problem: the resettlement of the applicant outside the zone and the reduction of the toxic emissions. As regards the resettlement, the Court found that little, if nothing, had been done in order to help the applicant moving to a safer area. As to the efforts of the authorities, aimed at reducing the pollution, the Court noted that a certain progress has been made since the 1980-s. However, the governmental programs and privately funded projects did not achieve expected results. Whereas, according to the 1990 Government Programme, the steel-plant was obliged to reduce its toxic emissions to a safe level by 1998, in 2004 the Chief Sanitary Inspector admitted that this had not been done and that the new deadline for bringing the plant's emissions below dangerous levels was henceforth 2015. During the period falling within the Court's competence ratione temporis (since 5 May 1998), the overall improvement of the environmental situation was very slow."

The Court accepted that, given the complexity and the scale of the environmental problem around the Severstal steel-plant, this problem could not be resolved in a short period of time. However, it did not mean that the authorities might remain passive. On the contrary, they had to take “reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants'rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8” ( Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ) in a shortest delay possible. Given the seriousness of the situation, the onus was on the State to show how it coped with the environmental problem. However, in that case the Government failed to do so. They did not show that the effects of the operation of the plant on public health and well-being were regularly monitored and the information obtained was shared with the population concerned. Further, the Government did not explain how the information available influenced their policy vis-à-vis the plant, and what that policy consisted of. Finally, the Government failed to show how the policy (if any) was enforced, which sanctions had been applied and for what kind of breaches. In these circumstances the Court drew adverse inferences and concluded that in regulating the steel-plant's industrial activities the authorities had not given due weight to the interests of the community living in close proximity to the premises of the Severstal steel-plant.",

Therefore, it may be assumed that she had had to endure the adverse effects of pollution for a shorter period of time than the other applicants. Indeed, the resettlement may have solved her problem for the future. However, it did not put right the alleged breach of her rights during the antecedent period and the authorities did not acknowledge the alleged breach of her rights under the Convention, nor expressly neither in substance. Accordingly, this fact does not deprive the fourth applicant of the status required to claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention within the meaning of Article 34."

The Government referred to a number of studies carried out in order to assess the environmental situation around the Severstal steel-plant. However, the Government have failed to produce these documents or to explain how they influenced the public policy vis-à-vis the plant. The only relevant report produced to the Court (see paragraph 29 above) was commissioned in 2003 by the plant itself in order to delimit its sanitary security zone. The information contained in that report was definitely useful for defining the extent of the environmental problem and its consequences, but it did not impose any particular obligations on the plant or the State authorities."

As regards other documents, produced by the Government, the Court notes that they reflect the company's environmental protection policy and the overall progress made in the recent years. However, this policy was not legally binding on the plant and its realisation to a great extent depended on the good will of the plant. The Court recalls in this respect that the central question of the present cases was how the State protected the applicants'rights under the Convention by regulating private industry. Since the interference with the applicants'rights persisted, it was of little relevance that the plant was willing to stop it and was taking practical steps in that direction. What is central for the present cases is how the State reacted to that situation, what legal mechanisms were employed in order to reduce the pollution to acceptable levels or, at least, to exclude those affected by the pollution from its effects."

Pursuing that matter, the Court notes that the Government did not produce the plant's operating permit, licence or other documents which would establish the Government's policy regulating the plant's industrial activities. The Government did not explain how the plant's compliance with the operating conditions of its licence, permit or general environmental standards was monitored and how it was enforced. The Government's argument that the plant functioned in compliance with the domestic and international environmental standards is not convincing. Thus, the fact that the management system of the plant was certified by an international organisation does not mean that the plant's emissions were at acceptable levels. The same concerns the audit by the EBRD experts, referred to by the Government. Nor did the Government provide the Court with a copy of the audit report, neither it explained what had been the purpose of it and its findings and recommendations."

The Court concludes that, despite the wide margin of appreciation left to the respondent State, the authorities failed to take appropriate measures in order to protect the applicants'right to respect for their homes and private lives against serious environmental nuisances. In particular, the authorities have neither resettled the applicants outside the dangerous zone, nor have they provided for a compensation for those seeking the resettlement. Furthermore, it appears that the authorities failed to develop and implement an efficient public policy which would induce the steel-plant to reduce its emissions to the safe levels within a reasonable time. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

As regards general effects of industrial pollution on the population of Cherepovets, the Government produced a report, prepared in 2003 by the Mechnikov Medical Academy in St- Petersburg in order to delimit the boundaries of the sanitary security zone. The conclusions of the report may be summarised as follows. The steel-plant's emissions in 2000 were half as much as in 1982. However, in 2000-2001 the concentration of several polluting substances in the air of the residential areas of the town still exceeded safe levels. At the same time the birth rate in the town was higher than the average in the country and the morbidity rate was lower. Most of the deceases registered in the town were not place-specific. However, prevalence of some chronic respiratory diseases was directly linked to the distance of the patients'houses from the territory of the steel-plant. The measures provided by the steel-plant in order to reduce emissions, would be capable of reducing health risks for the population of Cherepovets. If all these measures were implemented, by 2015 the concentration of pollutants in the air of the residential areas of the town could reach 1 MPL, which is the acceptable level. It would be possible to establish a sanitary security zone at a distance of one kilometre from the main sources of pollution. Having regard to the measures, scheduled for the period of 2002-2015, it would be possible to fix the boundaries of the sanitary security zone at the confines of the residential areas of the city."

That certificate concluded that the realisation of the project would allow by 2015 a complete reduction of the concentration of air contaminants to hygienic standards, which would “ guarantee reaching acceptable levels of public health hazards”."

The State Weather Forecast Agency of Cherepovets reported that the level of atmospheric pollution between 1997 and 2001 within the zone was rated as “high” or “very high”. Notably, a high concentration of hazardous substances, such as hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and carbolic acid was registered. According to a resolution of the Chief Health Inspector ( главный санитарный врач ) of 7 August 2000, the atmospheric pollution in the zone adversely affected public health, increasing the risk of cancer, as well as of respiratory and cardiac diseases."

                "77. First, the Government emphasised that the applicants had moved to the houses situated within the zone voluntarily, and, therefore, the State could not be held responsible for resettling them outside of it."

            [
                "78. Secondly, they claimed that after the annulment of municipal decree no. 30 the sanitary security zone has not been delimited, and the applicants, therefore, were not living in the zone. In any event, the applicants'temporary residence in an environmentally unfavourable territory was permissible under Article 10 of the Town Planning Code."

            [
                "79. Thirdly, the domestic courts had never examined the influence of industrial pollution on the applicants'health nor assessed the damage caused by it, because the applicants had not raised these issues in the domestic proceedings. Numerous examinations of the state of environmental pollution in the town did not reveal any extreme cases of environmental pollution. The applicants have failed to use the means prescribed by the Russian legislation for assessing environmental hazards. Namely, they did not obtain a report from the State Sanitary and Epidemiologic Service, as provided by decree no. 326 of the Public Health Ministry of the Russian Federation of 2001. Their flats were not declared unfit for living by a special commission, as provided by the Government Decree no. 552 of 2003. The different illnesses from which the applicants suffered have not been caused by the emissions from the Severstal steel plant, but were of general or occupational character."
            ],
            [
                "80. Fourthly, the Government claimed that, although the law provided for suspension or cessation of industrial activities of the polluting enterprises, “such question has never come up” with respect to the Severstal steel-plant. Since the 1980-s, the volume of overall emission of the steel-plant was reduced almost to one third. The most dangerous industrial units were closed and the emissions of high-risk chemical substances were reduced by 100 times. Every year the “ Severstal ” PLC spent about 250 million Roubles on environmental protection programs. In 2000 the company was audited by the “Bureau Veritas Quality International”, an international organisation, which established that the system of the environmental protection management of the company was in conformity with international standards. Further, in 1999 the Severstal steel-plant underwent technical and ecological expertise of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). As a result, the operation of the steel-plant was recognised to be in conformity with EBRD standards. The Government concluded that these aspects of the present cases permitted to distinguish them from the case López Ostra v. Spain ( judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303 ‑ C, p. 46-47, § 16-22), where the plant had operated without the appropriate licence and had been finally closed."

            [
                "81. Finally, the Government argued that the authorities had conducted regular examinations of the public health situation and had adopted various programs in order to improve it. In recent years the implementation of a number of federal and municipal programmes, as well as projects funded by the “ Severstal ” PLC resulted in a reduction of pollution in Cherepovets. Thus, in 1991 the proportion of “irregular samples” of the town's air was 37,6 per hundred. In 1998 it was 32,8 per hundred, and in 2004 only 23,6 per hundred. The Government stressed that the environmental monitoring carried out by State agencies revealed an improvement in the overall environmental situation throughout the town, and that the pollution levels near the applicants'houses did not differ significantly from the average levels across the town. They produced reports, prepared by the “ Severstal ” PLC for the general public, which described the plant's environmental policy and the progress made in recent years. Therefore, unlike in the López Ostra case, cited above, in the present cases the applicants'situation was improving, and not degrading with the course of time."

However, it was the finding of the domestic courts that the houses where the applicants lived were located within the sanitary security zone of the Severstal steel-plant. It was only after their applications had been lodged with the Court that the Russian authorities changed the regulations pertaining to the sanitary security zone of the Severstal steel plant. Consequently, the applicants submitted that they should be considered as having lived in the sanitary security zone at the material time. They lived there for many years, so Article 10 of the former City Planning Code, referred to by the Government, which allowed temporary dwelling in conditions of unfavourable environment, was not applicable."

The Government's argument that the steel plant operated in full compliance with domestic legislation could not be upheld. As to the link between the state of their health and the steel-plant's industrial emissions, the applicants noted that they have never alleged that the sole cause of their diseases was the operation of the steel-plant. The primary argument that they had consistently made was the fact that the persons suffering from such illnesses were more vulnerable than others to living in such an unhealthy environment."

                "86. As regards the measures, taken by the authorities and the plant itself in order to improve the environmental situation, the applicants noted the following. The federal programme of improvement of the ecological situation in Cherepovets for 1997 — 2010, referred to by the Government, was abolished by the Government's Decree of 7 December 2001. Since 1996 no official inquiry into the environmental situation in Cherepovets, which could influence the Government's actions towards the resolution of environmental problems, has ever been carried out. The specific consequences of any official inquiries have never been stated by the Government and such information has not been made adequately publicly available. The yearly National Report on Ecological Situation in Russia indicated year by year that the environmental situation in the Vologda region remained “ difficult ”, which significantly undermined the Government's arguments on effectiveness of the measures alleged aimed at amelioration of the environmental situation in the Vologda Region."

The applicants were not aware of any fines ever having been imposed on the “ Severstal ” PLC, although the Code of Administrative Offences provided for such possibility."

                "89. At the outset, the Court recalls that in assessing evidence it uses the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties'submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, 6 July 2005, with further references)."

The present four applications belong to this second category. There is no doubt that serious industrial pollution negatively affects public health in general. However, it is often impossible to quantify its effects in each individual case, and distinguish them from the influence of other relevant factors, such as age, profession etc. The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. The “quality of life” is a very subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition. Therefore, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court has no other choice than to repose thrust primarily, although not exclusively, in the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing factual circumstances of the case (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, pp. 1291-93, § § 74-7 7). However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially when they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such situation it has to assess the evidence in its entirety.",

The Court recalls its findings in the Fadeyeva case, where it found that the applicant's private life and enjoyment of her home had been seriously affected by the pollution, caused by the industrial emissions of the Severstal steel-plant. In reaching that conclusion, the Court paid special attention to the following facts."

                "92. First of all, it was widely recognised that the environmental situation in Cherepovets was unfavourable for the residents of the town and adversely affected their health and well-being. Although the situation improved since the 1980-s, when it was almost catastrophic, it still remained unsatisfactory, at least from the standpoint of the domestic standards. Namely, concentration of several polluting substances in the air of the city continuously exceeded safe levels, established by the domestic legislation, the MPLs."

Secondly, it was established that Ms Fadeyeva lived in the territory of the zone, which was initially designated to separate residential areas from the sources of pollution, but, in the course of time, was turned into a residential area. Although the law did not clearly require the resettlement of the residents of such zones, it prohibited any permanent dwelling in it because of the dangers it represented."

Thirdly, the Court relied on the reports on the environmental situation in Cherepovets, which confirmed that the over -concentration of certain pollutants in the town's air caused an increase in the morbidity rate for the city's residents (see §§ 11, 14, 33, 45 and 46 of the Fadeyeva judgment )."

                "96. Turning to the present cases, the Court notes that the applicants'situations do not differ significantly from that of Ms Fadeyeva. Although at the relevant time all of them lived at different addresses, their flats were located within the sanitary security zone of PLC “ Severstal ”, as defined by municipal decree no. 30. It should be noted that on 2 March 2000 the fourth applicant obtained a new flat from the authorities and moved outside the zone. The Court is thus prepared to accept that she is no longer exposed to dangerous levels of pollution. However, the interference complained of was of a continuing nature and lasted almost two years, if counted from 5 May 1998 (the date when the Convention entered into force with respect to Russia ). Therefore, her moving outside the zone did not by itself eradicate the adverse effects of her living there, and for a certain period of time she was in the same situation as other applicants (for further details see paragraph 106 below)."

However, it appears that at the time the applicants were unable to make an informed choice, or were not in a position to reject the housing offered by the State, or move elsewhere at their own expense (see the Fadeyeva judgment, § § 119 and 120 ). Thus, it cannot be claimed that the applicants themselves created the situation complained of or were somehow responsible for it (see also, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 105 et seq., ECHR 2004 ‑ ... )."

                "98. The Government further indicated that in 2002 municipal decree no. 30 had been annulled, and, at present, the boundary of the sanitary security zone remains undefined. The Federal Program of 1996, which provided for the resettlement of the residents of the zone, is no longer in force. On these grounds on 12 July 2002 the Cherepovets Town Court rejected the first applicant's claims against the steel-plant. However, in the Court's view, it does not mean that the danger for the first and other applicants'health and well-being is no longer there. The de facto abolishment of the sanitary security zone was decided not because the concentrations of toxic substances reached safe levels, but on formal grounds. For almost ten years decree no. 30 was in force and applied by the courts. Its validity has not been called into question either by the steel -plant, or by the municipality itself. Moreover, on many occasions various domestic official bodies confirmed that the applicants lived in the territory of the sanitary security zone where concentrations of certain toxic substances were above acceptable levels and which was therefore unsuitable for human residence. At last, in their observations on admissibility and merits the Government admitted that the applicants'houses were located within the zone (see the decision on admissibility of the present cases of 16 September 2004 ). Thus, in the eyes of the Court, the annulment of decree no. 30 and ensuing changes in the legal status of the zone has no bearing on the applicants'situation from the standpoint of their complaints under Article 8 of the Convention."

The Government finally indicated that the applicants had not obtained appropriate reports from relevant State bodies confirming that the place where they lived was unfit for living and that this matter had not been discussed before the domestic courts. In this respect the Court notes, first of all, that the Government referred to the legislation which had been enacted in 2001 - 2003, which was after the applicant's cases had been examined by the domestic courts. Secondly, the Court reiterates that in the proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 8 9 above). The applicants produced a large number of other documents, official reports, letters of various State authorities, confirming that the concentration of certain pollutants near the applicants'houses was constantly above safe levels, established by the Russian legislation. Moreover, this fact is supported by the data produced by the Government itself (see above, paragraphs 27 et seq.). Finally, at the time when the domestic proceedings took place the existence of interference with the applicants'private sphere was taken for granted at the domestic level, since the law defined the territory where they dwelled as unfit for residence, and presumed that the concentrations of pollutants that they had been exposed to were unsafe."

Further, the Court considers that the continuing operation of the Severstal steel-plant contributed to the economic system of the Vologda region and, to that extent, served a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention (see Fadeyeva, §§ 98 – 100).

In that case the Court considered two alternative avenues that could have been employed by the authorities in order to solve the applicant's problem: the resettlement of the applicant outside the zone and the reduction of the toxic emissions. As regards the resettlement, the Court found that little, if nothing, had been done in order to help the applicant moving to a safer area. As to the efforts of the authorities, aimed at reducing the pollution, the Court noted that a certain progress has been made since the 1980-s. However, the governmental programs and privately funded projects did not achieve expected results. Whereas, according to the 1990 Government Programme, the steel-plant was obliged to reduce its toxic emissions to a safe level by 1998, in 2004 the Chief Sanitary Inspector admitted that this had not been done and that the new deadline for bringing the plant's emissions below dangerous levels was henceforth 2015. During the period falling within the Court's competence ratione temporis (since 5 May 1998), the overall improvement of the environmental situation was very slow."

Given the seriousness of the situation, the onus was on the State to show how it coped with the environmental problem. However, in that case the Government failed to do so. They did not show that the effects of the operation of the plant on public health and well-being were regularly monitored and the information obtained was shared with the population concerned. Further, the Government did not explain how the information available influenced their policy vis-à-vis the plant, and what that policy consisted of. Finally, the Government failed to show how the policy (if any) was enforced, which sanctions had been applied and for what kind of breaches.

Indeed, the resettlement may have solved her problem for the future. However, it did not put right the alleged breach of her rights during the antecedent period and the authorities did not acknowledge the alleged breach of her rights under the Convention, nor expressly neither in substance.

However, the Government have failed to produce these documents or to explain how they influenced the public policy vis-à-vis the plant. The only relevant report produced to the Court (see paragraph 29 above) was commissioned in 2003 by the plant itself in order to delimit its sanitary security zone.

As regards other documents, produced by the Government, the Court notes that they reflect the company's environmental protection policy and the overall progress made in the recent years. However, this policy was not legally binding on the plant and its realisation to a great extent depended on the good will of the plant. The Court recalls in this respect that the central question of the present cases was how the State protected the applicants'rights under the Convention by regulating private industry. Since the interference with the applicants'rights persisted, it was of little relevance that the plant was willing to stop it and was taking practical steps in that direction. What is central for the present cases is how the State reacted to that situation, what legal mechanisms were employed in order to reduce the pollution to acceptable levels or, at least, to exclude those affected by the pollution from its effects."

The Government did not explain how the plant's compliance with the operating conditions of its licence, permit or general environmental standards was monitored and how it was enforced. The Government's argument that the plant functioned in compliance with the domestic and international environmental standards is not convincing.

In particular, the authorities have neither resettled the applicants outside the dangerous zone, nor have they provided for a compensation for those seeking the resettlement. Furthermore, it appears that the authorities failed to develop and implement an efficient public policy which would induce the steel-plant to reduce its emissions to the safe levels within a reasonable time.

In sum, taking into account various relevant factors, such as age, the applicant's state of health and the duration of the situation complained of, and making an assessment on an equitable basis in accordance with Article 41, the Court awards the applicants under the head of non-pecuniary damages the following amounts:",
                "( i ) EUR 7,000 to the first applicant,",
                "( ii ) EUR 8,000 to the second applicant,",

As regards future measures to be adopted by the Government in order to comply with the Court's finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, the Court notes the applicants in this respect are in different situations. The fourth applicant has been resettled outside the zone in 2000. Having regard to the information available and the scope of the present case, the Court considers that her individual problem has thus been solved and the Government has no further obligations vis-à-vis this applicant under the Convention, apart from paying her compensation for the past sufferings (see paragraph 114 above)."

The Court notes that the resettlement of them in an environmentally safer area (a measure sought by the applicants before the domestic instances) would be only one of many possible solutions. The Court is conscious that there are other possible ways of reducing the negative effects of the plant's activities on those who, like the applicants, reside in the vicinity of it. Therefore, given the complexity of the situation, and in line with its approach to the Fadeyeva case, cited above, the Court will not prescribe any particular legal, administrative or other measure to be adopted by the Government. According to Article 41 of the Convention, by finding a violation of Article 8 in the present case, the Court establishes the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation. Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Articles 41 and 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the present judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 4 1963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII), in particular, with the two alternative solutions examined by the Court (see paragraph 110 above)."

From the materials of the case and correspondence with the Court it is clear that Mr Vanzha represented the applicants in the domestic proceedings and before the Court at the initial stage of the proceedings. The applicants claimed that they were under an obligation to pay Mr Vanzha certain amounts for his work. Mr Vanzha, in his turn, confirmed this claim by producing the calculation of his fees. Therefore, the Court concludes that the lawyer's fees are real."

Further, the Court excludes expenses which were not related to the proceedings before the domestic courts and the European court. Finally, the Court considers that since the individual situations of the applicants were quite similar, the preparation of their cases did not require as much time is indicated in the calculation produced by Mr Vanzha. Consequently, making an assessment on a reasonable basis, the Court awards each of the applicant EUR 800 for the costs incurred under this head, or EUR 3, 2 00 for all of them."

Furthermore, the existence of the applicant ’ s right of access to the information sought was recognised both in the domestic legislation and in three final Supreme Administrative Court judgments which ordered the mayor to provide the information to her (see paragraphs 10, 1 4 and 1 8 above).

Section 4 of the SMRDA provides that compensation is due for all damage which is the direct and proximate result of the unlawful act or omission. The State ’ s liability is strict, i.e. no fault is required on the part of the civil servants in the commission of the unlawful acts. A claim for damages could be made after the administrative act in question had been quashed in prior proceedings.

In her view such a non-substantial fine could not guarantee that the official responsible to act would do so in the absence of a mechanism for actual enforcement.

At the same time, the Court has consistently emphasised that Article 10 guarantees not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 59(b), Series A no. 216; Guerra and Others v. Italy, 19 February 1998, § 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I; Ahmet Yıldırım v. Turkey, no. 3111/10, § 50, ECHR 2012). In that connection it has held that particularly strong reasons must be provided for any measure limiting access to information which the public has the right to receive (see Timpul Info-Magazin and Anghel v. Moldova, no. 42864/05, § 31, 27 November 2007; Węgrzynowski and Smolczewski v. Poland, no. 33846/07, § 57, 16 July 2013)."

Furthermore, the existence of the applicant ’ s right of access to the information sought was recognised both in the domestic legislation and in three final Supreme Administrative Court judgments which ordered the mayor to provide the information to her (see paragraphs 10, 1 4 and 1 8 above). The Court also notes that the Government did not dispute the applicability of Article 10 to the facts of the present case.

What is more, until the applicant lodged her application with the Court on 18 January 2007 only the Act 1997 was applicable, as it was repealed by the Code on 1 March 2007. In any event, even if it were accepted that Article 304 of the Code was applicable to the present case because the failure to enforce the three judgments in the applicant ’ s favour represented a continuing situation which had not been resolved after the entry into force of the Code, the Court has already held that imposing a pecuniary sanction under that Article could not be considered an effective remedy for the reasons that the applicant could not take part in the related proceedings, nor could he appeal against a possible refusal to impose such a sanction (see Stoyanov and Tabakov v. Bulgaria, no. 34130/04, § 99, 26 November 2013)."

                "46. As regards the Government ’ s second objection of non-exhaustion, namely the possibility of bringing a claim for damages, the Court notes that as of July 2006 a claim for damages can be brought not only against the State, but also against the municipalities under section 1 of the SMRDA (see paragraph 2 9 above). Indeed, the Court has held that proceedings for damages could, in principle, be considered an effective remedy in cases of non-enforcement of final administrative court decisions (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 99; Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov, cited above, § 65; Stoyanov and Tabakov, cited above, § 102). However, in cases where the authorities were expected to take specific action to comply with a final court judgment and not simply pay compensation, the Court has repeatedly dismissed an objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies based on the possibility to bring a tort action against the State (see Hadzhigeorgievi v. Bulgaria, no. 41064/05, § 50, 16 July 2013; Mutishev and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 18967/03, § 104, 3 December 2009, with further references; Lyubomir Popov v.

Bulgaria, nos. 19130/04, 17694/05 and 27777/06, 25 September 2012). The reason for it was that a compensatory remedy in the form of a claim for damages could not provide adequate redress in a situation where the authorities were called upon to take specific, i.e. non-substitutable measures, as was the case for example where they had to accelerate and complete the process of restitution of agricultural land. The Government have not put forward arguments capable of convincing the Court to depart from the approach adopted in the above cases."

While the Court is aware of two final decisions in which the domestic courts awarded damages for non ‑ enforcement of final judgments (see paragraph 30 above), it notes that in a number of other decisions the courts have rejected such claims (see paragraph 30 above) or awarded damages not in connection with the failure to enforce but because of the quashing of the initial administrative act by the courts (see on this last point Stoyanov and Tabakov, cited above, § 104 ). Consequently, the Court finds that the domestic practice is not sufficiently consolidated to allow it to conclude that the compensation remedy provided for in the SMRDA is an effective one for the purposes of exhaustion in cases where final administrative court judgments have not been acted upon."

In addition, the Court observes that in the present case the three final judgments in the applicant ’ s favour date back to May and October 2004, while the possibility to seek damages against the municipality was introduced in law in July 2006 (see paragraph 2 9 above). Therefore, the period of around two years during which the applicant could not seek damages in law was in itself sufficiently long to be considered problematic under the Convention (see Androsov v. Russia, no. 63973/00, § 53, 6 October 2005, where the Court held that a delay of a year and 12 days to enforce a final judgment against the regional authorities had been too long)."

The Court notes that, in any event, she could have only attempted that remedy as of 1 March 2007 which was more than two and a half years after the judgments in her favour had entered into force. The Court considers that the utility of the information for the purposes of the applicant ’ s request would have been greatly diminished due to the passage of time. It recalls in this connection that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication for indeterminate periods, or its dissemination as in the instant case, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian, cited above, § 60 ). The Court has held that these principles also apply to the publication of books in general or written texts other than the periodical press (see, in the case of an association applicant complaining about a ban on its publication, Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII). The applicant in the present case sought information, including statistical data, in order to inform the public about a question of general interest which had been relevant during a particular period of time, namely more than two years before the remedy under Article 290 of the Code 2006 was introduced.

Therefore, the information was directly related to her work as a member and representative of the association which was active in the field of animal defence. Consequently, the applicant was involved in the legitimate gathering of information of public interest for the purpose of contributing to public debate. According to the applicant, the three final judgments in her favour remained entirely unenforced. As the Government did not provide information capable of demonstrating the opposite, the Court sees no reason to find otherwise. Therefore, by not providing the information which the applicant had sought, the mayor interfered in the preparatory stage of the process of informing the public by creating an administrative obstacle (see, similarly, Társaság a Szabadságjogokért, cited above, § 28).

The reason was that in Frăsilă and Ciocîrlan, cited above, a private company, as opposed to a public authority, had prevented the applicants from gaining access to a newsroom which had been ordered in a final judgment in the applicants ’ favour. As a result, the Court examined the responsibility of the State as a positive obligation to protect the exercise of the Article 10 rights of the applicants, two journalists, from interference by others. In the present case it was a public authority, the mayor of Vidin, who failed to act in order to implement the final judgments in the applicant ’ s favour (see paragraph 2 1 above) despite being bound to do so in law. Consequently, the mayor ’ s failure to act in accordance with the final judgments constitutes a direct interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive and ultimately to impart information as enshrined in Article 10 § 1 of the Convention (see Társaság a Szabadságjogokért, cited above, § 28; Österreichische, cited above, § 36; Kenedi, cited above, § 43 ).",

More specifically in respect of the law, the Court has held that it has to be of a certain quality, namely that its provisions should be clear and accessible, and the consequences of its application foreseeable ( see, among other authorities, Müller and Others v.

The Court also notes that on this point the Supreme Administrative Court had held that, as the law did not provide time-limits within which the administrative body had to comply with final judgments, the decision as to when the judgment should be enforced was entirely in the hands of the administrative body concerned (see paragraph 2 5 above).

Notwithstanding this, the national judicial practice had accepted that the law itself provided no clear time-frame for enforcement and the question was left to the good will of the administrative body responsible for the implementation of the judgment (see paragraph 2 5 above). The Court finds that such a lack of clear time-frame for enforcement created unpredictability as to the likely time of enforcement, which, in the event, never materialised.

The claim concerned the alleged unlawfulness of the enforcement of the demolition order, and the claimant relied on, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention. In upholding the lower court ’ s decision to dismiss the claim, the Supreme Administrative Court analysed the demolition in terms of that Article, finding that it had amounted to an interference with the claimant ’ s right to respect for her home. It said that the enforcement authority should have taken into account that the house had been the claimant ’ s only home.

Any arguments relating to their poor health or lack of means were irrelevant. The balance between the competing interests had been resolved at the legislative level.

It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time : the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants ’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate. Article 8 of the Convention could not be construed as precluding the enforcement of the building regulations in respect of those who sought to flout them, or as requiring the authorities to provide persons in the applicants ’ situation with a place to live."

The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances."

An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v.

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73 - 76 below ), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § § 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one ’ s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual ’ s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person ’ s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, § § 114-16 ). On the contrary, the Ombudsman of the Republic has repeatedly expressed concern in that regard (see paragraphs 41 - 43 above)."

Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37 - 39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above )."

The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them ( see paragraph 26 in fine above ) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Nor does it appear that, as suggested by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 1 June 2015 in a similar case ( see paragraph 30 above ), it would have been possible, as matters stand, to obtain a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by seeking judicial review of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 294 et seq. of the 2006 Code (see paragraph 35 above ). Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above)."

The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned. Moreover, in the applicants ’ case the enforcement proceedings started less than one month after the demolition order was upheld by the courts (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above)."

In the alternative, the Government submitted that the interference with the first applicant ’ s possessions was justified. The demolition, which was a measure of control of property, was lawful and would not impose an excessive burden on the applicants as their financial situation, as evident from the property disposal transactions carried out by them, was not so dire, and as they had wilfully acted in defiance of the law. Moreover, the house did not exclusively belong to the first applicant; the other co-owners of the plot were entitled to a share of it, and some of them had objected to its construction. The legitimate aim sought to be achieved by the demolition was to enforce the building regulations, which required a permit for each newly constructed building.

There is no incongruity in this, as the intensity of the interests protected under those two Articles, and the resultant margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under each of them, are not necessarily co-extensive (see Connors, cited above, § 82). Thus, although the Court has in some cases assessed the proportionality of a measure under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the light of largely the same factors as those that it has taken into account under Article 8 of the Convention (see Zehentner, §§ 52-65 and 70-79; Gladysheva, §§ 64-83 and 90-97; and Rousk, §§ 108 - 27 and 134-42, all cited above, as well as Demades v.

The applicant company thought that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been implementing the function of public administration, and that that document had had a direct influence on the applicant company ’ s rights and obligations, and was thus an individual legal act that had to be examined before the administrative courts. On 28 November 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court of 23 July 2012. It held that the applicant company had questioned the lawfulness of both the Management Plan and the development plan. The Supreme Administrative Court held that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been carrying out the function of State power. Moreover, the court had already ruled on the issue of the attribution of the Management Plan to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and had decided that it had not been attributable to those courts (see paragraph 79 below). The court indicated that a legal act could consist of textual and graphic information (tables, drawings, schemes, plans, symbols, emblems). The Constitutional Court had already held that all parts of a legal act were interrelated and were of equal legal effect (see paragraph 77 below). The court further held that the present case was in substance identical to cases already examined by it, and that there were no grounds to reach a different conclusion on the nature of the Management Plan. The court explained that the applicant company could only raise the issue of the lawfulness of the Government Resolution in the context of an individual case regarding violation of its specific rights (by complaining against an individual legal act, by which the Government Resolution and the decisions of the Management Plan would be implemented). It could then ask the court examining that case to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The applicant company ’ s request to organise the procedure to amend the Management Plan so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of the Management Plan."

The court acknowledged that the authority ’ s decision had lacked a seal of approval but held that that shortcoming could not be regarded as grounds to overrule the decision. The court also held that the authority had not acted unlawfully, so there were no grounds for awarding the applicant company pecuniary damages. Moreover, domestic law did not require that the Management Plan contain a compensation mechanism for the buildings to be “ removed ”. However, the Management Plan in question indicated that an area in Juodkrantė had been designated to compensate for the losses incurred by the lawful owners of the buildings to be removed. Thus the Management Plan provided for the opportunity to compensate for possible losses. As regards the referral to the Constitutional Court, the court held that the applicant company had mistakenly stated that the decision to remove the buildings had only been indicated in the Management Plan. The court stated that it was a commonly known fact that the applicant company ’ s buildings had been earmarked for removal at the time the purchase agreement had been concluded, and the applicant company, as a diligent legal entity, should have assessed the legal status of the buildings and the restrictions on their use. The legitimate expectations of the applicant company had not been breached as it had not proved the need to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The court also pointed out that the buildings had not been taken from the applicant company for the needs of society (see paragraph 45 below). However, when using them the applicant company had to follow the legal regulations, which established that construction in the area in question was not allowed and that it was attempting to protect its rights in the wrong way.

On 29 November 2000 the Curonian Spit was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List, subject to the following criterion: “The Curonian Spit is an outstanding example of a landscape of sand dunes that is under constant threat from natural forces (wind and tide). After disastrous human interventions that menaced its survival the Spit was reclaimed by massive protection and stabilization works begun in the 19th century and still continuing to the present day.”",

The formation of the landscape in the Curonian Spit is still taking place; the social role of modern society, which is related to the traditional lifestyle and in which the evolutionary process is still in progress, is still active. The Curonian Spit reflects the material changes which have been taking place over the course of many decades and which are closely related to the interaction of natural forces and human beings. In the Curonian Spit, one can still see the remains of landscape where evolutionary processes have ended. There is the ethnographic heritage of the Curonian tribe, which lived in the Curonian Spit for a long time (and which is now extinct). In the relevant documents, the following examples of cultural heritage in the Curonian Spit have been noted: fishermen ’ s settlements where the interaction of man and nature is, from an ethno-cultural, historical and aesthetic point of view, of exceptional universal value; a wealth of unique works of architecture which, from an artistic and scientific point of view, were of exceptional value; and archaeological sites which are especially significant, owing to villages being swallowed up by moving sand. The particular importance of the Curonian Spit is also reflected by natural and cultural heritage, which is woven together in a picturesque manner and which is related not only to material or spiritual aspects, but also to the experience gained by every generation of the local people. This helps to rebuild the lost natural ecosystems of the Curonian Spit.",

As the Court has stated on a number of occasions, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 comprises three distinct rules: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, inter alia, to have a measure of control over the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 98, ECHR 2000-I, and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, § 217, ECHR 2015).",

The Court notes that the applicant company was banned from developing its property, situated in the Curonian Spit National Park, which was subject to a specific legal regime and designated for demolition, by virtue of the development plan, which was in force when it acquired the buildings. Subsequently, the Management Plan (see paragraphs 26 and 53 above) and relevant domestic regulations proscribed any construction in the area where the applicant company ’ s buildings were located. In fact, the only legal action the applicant company could take with regard to the buildings was to demolish or resell them. The inability to develop his or her own property constitutes a limitation of the rights normally enjoyed by a property owner (see Matczyński v. Poland, no. 32794/07, § 96, 15 December 2015). The Court is therefore of the view that there has been an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of the applicant company ’ s possessions."

                "101. The Court observes that the development plan, the Management Plan and relevant domestic law did not deprive the applicant company of its possessions but rather imposed certain restrictions on the use of those possessions. The applicant company ’ s buildings were designated for demolition in 1994. It cannot be said that the applicant company was deprived of its possessions. Moreover, contrary to its statements, it did not look after the buildings as required by domestic law, which resulted in an inspection (see paragraphs 32 and 57 above) and the requirement to repair the buildings and to remove the parts that were falling down. That cannot be regarded as equivalent to carrying out major repair work (see paragraph 55 above). The Court therefore considers that the applicant company ’ s ownership right with respect to the buildings did not disappear. The restrictions thus may be regarded as measures to control the use of property (see Potomska and Potomski v. Poland, no. 33949/05, § 63, 29 March 2011). However, the applicant company ’ s complaint also relates to the authorities ’ alleged failure to take relevant decisions as regards compensation, time-limits for demolition and refusal to allow the applicant company to develop the property. Having regard to the different facets of the applicant company ’ s complaint, the Court considers that it should examine the situation complained of under the general rule established in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention ( ibid. ).",

The applicant company ’ s buildings were designated for demolition in the development plan of 1994, six years prior to the purchase and the restrictions preventing the development of the property were already in existence when the applicant company acquired it (see paragraphs 8, 51 - 53 above). Although a number of provisions of the development plan have been changed by the Management Plan in 2012, the provisions concerning the applicant company ’ s buildings remained unchanged since 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The Court thus considers that the applicant company knew, or should reasonably have known, that under the domestic law in force at the time when it bought the buildings in question, the property was designated for demolition and although the date of the demolition had not been set, it had to take place at some point in time. The whole text and schemes of the development plan were accessible to all those who wanted to access them (see paragraph 69 above). The applicant company thus could not reasonably have expected to obtain planning permission to redevelop the buildings, in particular to reconstruct them by changing their designation, function or size, even if such possibility might have been considered at some point in time (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) and must already have accepted the risk at the time of purchase because the demolition had to take place at some point in time. Contrary to the applicant company ’ s arguments, as is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the Management Plan of 2012 did not change the designation of the property, and its classification has not changed since. The applicant company thus was never entitled to any compensation for demolition of the buildings, irrespective of when such demolition had to take place."

The Court thus considers that the interference with the applicant company ’ s peaceful enjoyment of its property was accompanied in the present case by sufficient procedural guarantees affording to it a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case to the relevant judicial authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision (see Sourlas v.
