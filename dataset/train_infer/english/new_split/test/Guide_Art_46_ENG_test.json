The Court decided to apply the pilot-judgment procedure in the present case, referring notably to the large number of people affected and the urgent need to grant them speedy and appropriate redress at domestic level. It is therefore convinced that the purpose of the present judgment can only be achieved if the required changes take effect in the Hungarian legal system and practice without undue delay."

The Court considers that a reasonable time-limit is warranted for the adoption of the measures, given the importance and urgency of the matter and the fundamental nature of the right which is at stake. Nonetheless, it does not find it appropriate to indicate a specific time frame for the arrangements which could lead to an overall improvement of conditions detention and the reduction of overcrowding, and for the introduction of a combination of preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of alleged violations of Article 3, which may involve the preparation of draft laws, amendments and regulations, then their enactment and implementation, together with the provision of appropriate training for the State officials concerned.

Rule 61 § 6 of the Rules of Court provides for the possibility of adjourning the examination of all similar applications pending the implementation of the remedial measures by the respondent State. The Court would emphasise that adjournment is a possibility rather than an obligation, as clearly shown by the inclusion of the words “as appropriate” in the text of Rule 61 § 6 and the variety of approaches used in the previous pilot-case judgments (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 143-146, where the adjournment concerned only the applications lodged after the delivery of the pilot judgment; and Rumpf, cited above, § 75, where an adjournment was not considered to be necessary)."

The court concluded that the plaintiff had suffered, during his detention, a disadvantage not inherent in a sentence of imprisonment, on account of the aggregation of overcrowded prison conditions and the lack of medical care, and awarded him 250,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 750 euros (EUR) ) as non-pecuniary damage for the violation of his personality rights.",

The court emphasised that one of the criteria as to whether or not to award compensation for a breach of personality rights was the damage actually caused by the respondent ’ s unlawful conduct. The infringement of the plaintiff ’ s personality rights did not in itself establish the prison facility ’ s liability for compensation.

In other words, the overpopulation rate doubled in four years (i.e. from 22 % to 44 %).",

Such a presentation of accommodation can be misleading because – though mathematically correct –in superficial interpretation it could suggest that the overcrowding (that is, the number of the prisoners) has doubled. To avoid this, but still properly emphasizing the magnitude and the gravity of the accommodation problem it is recommended to specify that in the course of the last 4 years the overcrowding of the prisons has increased by a further 22%, to 144%.",

It should be emphasized that the Prison Service is under the general obligation of providing accommodation, and it cannot significantly affect either the number or the temporal and geographical distribution of the admissions. The Government has worked out a new standpoint about subsequent adjustments with a view to long-term planning; by starting a new, comprehensive, multi-year programme for capacity expansion, and by placing the execution of the tasks of the Prison Service on new footing.",
                "The aim of the programme is the uniform distribution of the additional responsibilities among the institutions. While agreeing with the fact that the programme is neither the sole nor the long-term solution, it should be emphasized that the work invested in it is not in vain, because it prevents much more serious – with the wording of the Report – problems than those caused.",

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 33-34, Series A no. 40; Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30 210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; Vučković and Others v. Serbia [GC], no. 17153/11, § 75, 25 March 2014 )."

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, amongst other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40).

If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Sergey Babushkin v.

The special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court ’ s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weaken the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements (see Yarashonen v.

In these circumstances, it cannot be said that any attempt by the applicant to seek with the penitentiary authorities an improvement of the conditions of his detention would give sufficient prospects of a successful outcome” (§ 75). In the present case, the authorities acknowledged that the Hungarian prisons were overcrowded and that in the material period the average rate of occupancy of Budapest Prison was 150% (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Consequently, the Court observes that, in the circumstances of the present case, the remedies referred to by the Government were not capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaint.

                "121. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII; Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 26, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII).",
                "122. The Court is mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by the applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about the conditions of their detention. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government.",
                "123. The Court has held on many occasions that cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant ’ s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations (see Gubin v. Russia, no. 8217/04, § 56, 17 June 2010, and Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts))."

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25)."

In particular, the Court has to have regard to the following three elements: (a) each detainee must have an individual sleeping place in the cell; (b) each must dispose of at least 3 square metres of floor space; and (c) the overall surface area of the cell must be such as to allow detainees to move freely between items of furniture.

Furthermore, the Court notes that, as opposed to pre-trial detention facilities and high-security prisons where inmates are confined to their cell for most of the day, when assessing the issue of overcrowding in post-trial detention facilities such as correctional colonies, it considered that the personal space in the dormitory should be viewed in the context of the applicable regime, providing for a wider freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees in correctional colonies during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Insanov v.

The Court firstly considers that when, as in the instant case, an individual has been convicted after proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. In that regard, it notes that Article 449 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure permits the reopening of proceedings at domestic level where the Court has found a violation of a person ’ s fundamental rights and freedoms. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in that case ( see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005-IV, and Panasenko v. Portugal, no. 10418/03, § 78, 22 July 2008). In the present case, the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by the Court of Appeal.",
                "42. Secondly, the Court notes that in the present case the only applicable basis for an award of just satisfaction lies in the fact that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards of Article 6. In that regard, it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and rejects this claim. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing ( see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 51, 10 March 2009). On the other hand, it considers it appropriate to award the applicant EUR 2, 400 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. ”",

In a judgment of 27 May 2009 (domestic proceedings no. 55/01.OTBEPS-A.S1), the Supreme Court held that the new ground, as set out in Article 449 § 1 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for review of a final judgment had to be interpreted restrictively. In the light of Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, it held that the reopening of proceedings was necessary “ where a decision of the European Court of Human Rights had concluded that a domestic judgment was contrary to the Convention or where there had been procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity as to cast serious doubt on the decision ( fortes dúvidas sobre a decisão ) adopted at the close of the proceedings, and, simultaneously, where the injured party continued to suffer very serious adverse effects as a result of the national decision, those effects could not be remedied by the just satisfaction awarded by the Court and restitutio in integrum could only be achieved by means of a retrial or the reopening of the proceedings ”.",

At this stage of the proceedings, the Supreme Court ’ s sole task – I repeat – is to determine whether this formal condition for granting a review is present. It will be for the body conducting the review to deliver a new judgment (Articles 460 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure) entailing the execution of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.”"

The principles set out by the Court in those judgments and that decision may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) Findings of a violation in its judgments are essentially declaratory and, by Article 46 of the Convention, the High Contracting Parties undertook to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they were parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 6 1 ).",
                "( b) The Committee of Ministers ’ role in this sphere does not mean, however, that measures taken by a respondent State to remedy a violation found by the Court cannot raise a new issue undecided by the judgment and, as such, form the subject of a new application that may be dealt with by the Court. In other words, the Court may entertain a complaint that a retrial at domestic level by way of implementation of one of its judgments gave rise to a new breach of the Convention ( ibid, § 62; see also Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 33, and Egmez, cited above, § 51).",
                "( c) On that basis, the Court has found that it had the competence to entertain complaints in a number of follow-up cases, for example where the domestic authorities had carried out a fresh examination of the case by way of implementation of one of the Court ’ s judgments, whether by reopening the proceedings or by initiating an entirely new set of proceedings ( see Egmez, cited above, § 52, and the references therein ).",
                "( d) It transpires from the Court ’ s case-law that the determination of the existence of a “new issue” very much depends on the specific circumstances of a given case and that distinctions between cases are not always clear-cut ( see Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 34, and, for an examination of that case-law, Egmez, cited above, § 54). The powers assigned to the Committee of Ministers by Article 46 to supervise the execution of the Court ’ s judgments and assess the implementation of measures adopted by States under that Article are not encroached on where the Court has to deal with relevant new information in the context of a fresh application ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 67)."

Nevertheless, as stated in Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, the practice of the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the Court ’ s judgments shows that in exceptional circumstances the re-examination of a case or the reopening of proceedings has proved the most efficient, if not the only, means of achieving restitutio in integrum, that is to say ensuring that the injured party is restored, as far as possible, to the situation which he or she enjoyed prior to the violation of the Convention.

For example, in the specific context of cases concerning the independence and impartiality of the Turkish national security courts, the Court has held that, in principle, the most appropriate form of redress would be for the applicant to be given a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Gençel v.

The respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment and with the rights of the defence."

The Court reiterates that in Bochan (no. 2) ( cited above ) it considered the issue of the applicability of Article 6 to remedies concerning the reopening of civil proceedings which had been concluded by final judicial decisions. The principles set out by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) According to long - standing and established case-law, the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a terminated case reopened. Extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought do not normally involve the determination of “civil rights and obligations” or of “any criminal charge” and therefore Article 6 is deemed inapplicable to them. This approach has also been followed in cases where the reopening of terminated domestic judicial proceedings has been sought on the ground of a finding by the Court of a violation of the Convention ( ibid ., §§ 44 ‑ 45, with the references therein).",
                "( b ) However, should an extraordinary remedy lead automatically or in the specific circumstances to a full reconsideration of the case, Article 6 applies in the usual way to the “reconsideration” proceedings. Moreover, Article 6 has also been found to be applicable in certain instances where the proceedings, although characterised as “extraordinary” or “exceptional” in domestic law, were deemed to be similar in nature and scope to ordinary appeal proceedings, the national characterisation of the proceedings not being regarded as decisive for the issue of applicability ( ibid ., §§ 46-47).",
                "( c) In sum, while Article 6 § 1 is not normally applicable to extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought, the nature, scope and specific features of the relevant procedure in the legal system concerned may be such as to bring the procedure within the ambit of Article 6 § 1 and of the safeguards of a fair trial which that provision affords to litigants ( ibid ., § 50)."
            ],
            [
                "61. As regards criminal proceedings, the Court has found that Article 6 is not applicable to applications for their reopening, given that a person who, having been convicted with final effect, submits such an application is not “ charged with a criminal offence ” within the meaning of that Article. Likewise, Article 6 is not applicable to a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law, brought with the aim of quashing a final conviction following a finding by the Court of a violation, as the person concerned is likewise not “ charged with a criminal offence ” in such proceedings (see, for example, Fischer v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 27569/02, ECHR 2003 -VI, and Öcalan v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010)."
            ],
            [
                "62. Still in the criminal-law sphere, the Court has held that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. Considerations such as the emergence of new facts, the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings that could affect the outcome of the case, or the need to afford redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments, all militate in favour of the reopening of proceedings. Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, §§ 55-57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts ’ power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujniţa v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, § 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v. Romania, no. 16382/03, § § 33 and 34, 4 November 2008 )."

Russia, no. 28730/03, §§ 39 and 40, 29 January 2009, and Giuran v. Romania, no. 24360/04, § 39, ECHR 2011 ( extracts ) ). Similarly, the Court has found that the upholding, after review proceedings, of a conviction which breached the right to a fair trial amounted to an error of assessment which perpetuated that breach (see Yaremenko v. Ukraine (no. 2), no. 66338/09, §§ 52-56 and 64-67, 30 April 2015). On the other hand, the arbitrary reopening of criminal proceedings, in particular to the detriment of a convicted person, infringes the right to a fair trial (see Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, § 25, 28 February 2006; Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 48, 24 May 2007; and Ştefan v. Romania, no. 28319/03, § 18, 6 April 2010)."

The Court has also considered other stages in criminal proceedings where the applicants were no longer “persons charged with a criminal offence” but persons “convicted ” as a result of judicial decisions deemed final under domestic law. Given that “criminal charge” is an autonomous notion and having regard to the impact which the procedure for examining an appeal on points of law may have upon the determination of a criminal charge, including the possibility of correcting errors of law, the Court has found that such a procedure is covered by the safeguards of Article 6 (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII), even where it is treated as an extraordinary remedy in domestic law and concerns a judgment against which no ordinary appeal lies. By the same token, the Court has held that the safeguards of Article 6 are applicable to criminal proceedings in which the competent court began by examining the admissibility of an application for leave to appeal with a view to having a conviction quashed (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115)."

In the latter eventuality, the Supreme Court must adjudicate on the conformity with substantive law of the decision delivered or on the lawfulness of the procedure followed, and decide whether or not the defects noted justify reopening the proceedings.",

Furthermore, under Article 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court may, if it decides to grant a review, suspend the execution of the sentence or security measure should it deem this necessary.",

The examination on the basis of Article 449 § 1 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is therefore likely to be decisive for the determination of a criminal charge, and in that respect has some features in common with an appeal on points of law ( compare Maresti v.

The Court should not act as a fourth - instance body and will therefore not question under Article 6 § 1 the national courts ’ assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (ibid., § 61; see also the cases cited therein: Dulaurans v.

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings ( see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 303 ‑ A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I).

However, as indicated in the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 14 (see paragraph 104 above), the infringement procedure does not aim to reopen before the Court the question of a violation, already decided in its first judgment. Nor does it provide for payment of a financial penalty by a High Contracting Party found to be in violation of Article 46 § 1. It follows that the Court is not competent to find a further violation of Articles 5 and 18 of the Convention. In reality, the finding of a violation of Article 46 § 1 means that the primary obligation resulting from the Court’s initial judgment, namely restitutio in integrum, with all the ensuing consequences, continues to exist, and that it is for the Committee of Ministers to continue to supervise the execution of the Court’s initial judgment."

Given the outcome of the present infringement proceedings, the Court finds, however, that in the interest of the proper administration of justice, the costs and expenses relating to these proceedings are to be reimbursed to Mr Kavala by the Government, in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum, in accordance with the Court’s established case-law. The Court notes in this regard that Mr Kavala – as a person concerned by the present proceedings – was invited by the Court to submit written observations. The preparation of these observations by his representatives necessarily entailed costs for which Mr Kavala claimed reimbursement. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the material in the case file and the observations submitted by the Government and Mr Kavala, as well as the above-mentioned criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award Mr Kavala 7,500 euros (EUR) in respect of the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings before it.

On 31 May 2013, however, the police intervened violently to remove the persons occupying the park. There were confrontations between the police and the demonstrators. The protest movement escalated in June and July and spread to several towns and cities in Türkiye, taking the form of meetings and demonstrations which sometimes led to violent clashes. Violent groups joined the demonstrators and committed acts of violence.

This evidence showed that H.J.B.’s participation at the meeting in question had been a means of hiding his links to the perpetrators of the attempted coup. Furthermore, this witness stated that H.J.B. had talked with him and confided that, each time that he came to Türkiye, extraordinary events took place. During that conversation, the hotel employee had also asked H.J.B. about the attempted coup, and the latter had attempted to hide his participation by replying “it’s a game, a false coup, I don’t think that such a thing is happening”. Moreover, the communications analysis report had revealed the existence of a link between H.J.B. and Mr Kavala, and it had been established that H.J.B and Mr Kavala had used telephone numbers registered in their respective names when contacting each other. Their respective mobile telephones had emitted signals from the same base transceiver station on 29 November 2014, as well as on 1, 3 and 5 June 2015 and on 7 and 9 March, 28 and 29 June and 18 July 2016, which showed that they also met in person for discussions. Mr Kavala’s statements indicated that he and H.J.B. had met in a restaurant on 18 July 2016, that is, after the attempted coup. In addition, the witness statement and the communications data proved that a relationship existed between H.J.B and Mr Kavala. Investigations into this relationship were still ongoing. For these reasons, the prosecutor’s office concluded that there was evidence to suggest that Mr Kavala was guilty of military or political espionage."

                "32. On the same date the magistrate’s court heard Mr Kavala. He stated, among other points, that the base receiver station in question covered a large central zone in which numerous hotels and his office were located, and that it was completely normal that his mobile telephone, and that of H.J.B., had emitted signals from the same station. He further stated that he had not taken part in the meeting held on 15 July 2016, while specifying that it had been a legal meeting in which certain civil servants had also participated. He considered it abnormal that, two years after his placement in pre-trial detention on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, he was being accused of espionage on the basis of the same facts. Lastly, he submitted that there was no prima facie evidence against him concerning the offence in question, and that the purpose of the request was to circumvent the Court’s judgment."

In support of its decision, it referred to the evidence mentioned in the prosecution request (see paragraph 31 above). It considered that there was concrete evidence which could justify the suspicions against Mr Kavala. It also held that the detention measure was proportionate, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the possible sentence."

The relevant parts of the investigating judge’s decision read as follows:",
                "“Having regard to the existing reports, the statements made by the suspect and witnesses, the relevant reports and the case file as a whole, certain evidence gives rise to strong suspicion against [Mr Kavala] of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order. However, the suspect has been detained for more than two years in connection with this offence. For this type of offence, Article 102 § 4 of the CCP lays down that the maximum length of detention on remand during the criminal investigation phase is two years. Given that the suspect is in detention in relation to another offence, and that the evidence has been collected, in the absence of a risk that the suspect will tamper with the evidence and in view of the time that he has spent in detention, it is considered that a measure of pre-trial detention would be severe. In consequence, it has been decided to accept the opinion from the Istanbul general prosecutor’s office regarding the suspect’s release on bail in relation to the offence of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, and to instruct, with immediate effect, that [Mr Kavala] be released on bail, unless he has been detained or convicted in connection with another offence...”",

            ],
            [
                "36. On 28 September 2020 the Istanbul prosecutor’s office issued an indictment against Mr Kavala in respect of charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order (Article 309 of the Criminal Code) and military or political espionage (Article 328 of the Criminal Code).",
                "In this indictment, the prosecutor’s office set out the charges against Mr Kavala. It argued that on various dates Mr Kavala had had telephone conversations with H.J.B., the content of which was unknown. Their respective mobile telephones had allegedly emitted signals from the same base receiver station. In addition, Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had dined together in a restaurant on 18 July 2016, after the attempted coup. Mr Kavala had also carried out multiple visits abroad, at a more frequent pace than in the preceding years. He had founded and provided financial support to NGOs, under the guise of lawfulness but for illegal purposes, with a view to taking the pulse of society. During the Gezi Park events, Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had attempted to provide the left-wing terrorist organisations with an environment that was conducive to violence, by mobilising cells infiltrated into the NGOs. In Türkiye, Mr Kavala had collaborated with H.J.B., who had maintained an organic link with foreign intelligence services.",
                "With regard to the offence of espionage, the prosecutor’s office also submitted that the spying activities were not limited to gathering and analysing confidential information, but that they also consisted in exploiting, with the help of the security services of numerous States, civil society actors, with a view to exercising economic, cultural, ideological and military pressure on these States and bringing about social engineering through activities conducted by NGOs in receipt of foreign funding. It alleged that in many countries retired officials from the intelligence services participated in think tanks and carried out social, cultural and political research which was subsequently submitted to the secret services.",
                "The prosecutor’s office pointed out that Mr Kavala was the representative of the Open Society Institute, an entity set up by G.S., an American businessman who was also one of the founders of the Foundation for an Open Society in Türkiye. It submitted that in 2002 Mr Kavala had founded Anadolu Kültür, a non-profit-making association, in order to control his illegal activities in Türkiye. It concluded from a report, prepared on 16 October 2018 by the Directorate General for Foundations, that Mr Kavala conducted projects through funds provided by the Foundation for an Open Society. In addition to analysing, for the purpose of espionage, the social and cultural features of Turkish society, the projects in question were intended to incite Turkish citizens to hatred and hostility on the grounds of a distinction based on their connection with a language, race, relation, sect or region. It considered that the aim of the Foundation for an Open Society was to overthrow the government by encouraging division within society. The prosecutor’s office also argued that the non-profit association and the other NGOs founded or led by Mr Kavala had carried out extensive research on the characteristics of the Turkish people, and that the aim of this research was to foster division, influence governments and make contact with the authorities of foreign States and international organisations.",
                "Again according to the prosecution, these activities, on the pretext of protecting freedoms, were in fact intended, under the supervision of the secret services, to overthrow the legitimate government. In this context, Mr Kavala had wished to create pockets of resistance in society, by conducting activities with the proclaimed aims of upholding women’s rights, protecting children from abuse, combatting violence against women, integrating minorities, and promoting freedom of expression and environmental protection. In so doing, he was attempting to group independent entities around these projects, with the aim of encouraging them, when the time came, to take part in mass demonstrations against the government.",
                "The prosecutor’s office argued that Mr Kavala had also funded, through his association Anadolu Kültür, many projects and documentary films on the origins of Turkish citizens, with the aim, firstly, of disseminating the belief that the Turkish State was assassinating citizens of Kurdish origin or subjecting them to serious human-rights violations, and, secondly, of provoking sympathy with regard to the PKK and its allies. In this connection, it referred to a series of reports and documentaries on the women’s section of the PKK, the situation of children in the south-east of Türkiye, the burning of villages and forced migration of populations, commemoration of the events in 1915 which had strongly affected the Armenian population, and the allegations of human-rights violations after the attempted coup, asserting that these reports and documentaries had been funded or supported by Mr Kavala or that they had been found on his smartphone or on the digital media found in his office.",
                "The prosecutor’s office also argued that during his visits to Germany Mr Kavala had met C.D., a journalist who lived in that country and had been convicted in Türkiye of disclosing classified documents (espionage), and that they had communicated with each other on numerous occasions via WhatsApp.",
                "It also argued that Mr Kavala had played an active role at the preparatory stage of the attempted coup. In support of that allegation, it cited the evidence set out below and concluded that H.J.B.’s activities coincided with the preparations for the attempted coup to an extent that was not “consistent with the normal course of life”. It mentioned various trips that H.J.B. had made to Türkiye or different towns in Türkiye, and that Mr Kavala had made to foreign countries before the attempted coup. It also argued that H.J.B. had stayed in Istanbul from 7 to 9 March 2016 and that, during this period, his mobile telephone and that of Mr Kavala had on numerous occasions emitted signals from the same base receiver station. It claimed that on 8 October 2016 H.J.B had had three telephone conversations with Mr Kavala, which had lasted 28 seconds, 36 seconds and 193 seconds respectively. H.J.B. had travelled twice to Türkiye and during his stays, his and Mr Kavala’s mobile telephones had emitted signals from the same base receiver station, in two districts of Istanbul – Şişli, where Mr Kavala’s office is located, and Fatih. In 2015 and 2016 the two men’s mobile telephones had also emitted signals from the same base receiver station, located in Şişli, on numerous occasions. Mr Kavala and H.J.B had allegedly met on 18 July 2016 in a restaurant. In addition, Mr Kavala had allegedly travelled to Germany from 11 to 14 November 2015. A.Ö., who was accused of being one of the instigators of the attempted coup and of having acted on instructions from Fetullah Gülen, had travelled to the United States on 14 November 2015.",
                "The prosecutor’s office also argued that Mr Kavala had used another mobile telephone for two and a half months in 2015, that is, the year in which elections were held and the PKK had declared autonomy in the south-east of Türkiye. However, it noted that it had proved impossible to find this telephone and that Mr Kavala had used other telephone numbers in Germany.",
                "The prosecution further submitted that Mr Kavala had exchanged emails with A.V., the content of which had not been recovered. It claimed that A.V., who had participated in the meeting on Büyükada on 15 July 2016, was a member of a Brussels-based think tank founded by, among others, G.S. and a former ambassador, and that he had facilitated Fetullah Gülen in obtaining a residence permit in the United States.",
                "The prosecutor’s office concluded from this evidence that Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had been informed in advance about the attempted coup and had established, in Türkiye and abroad, a network of contacts with the aim of creating the infrastructure for the attempted coup. It also considered that although it had been possible to bring to light only a limited number of direct exchanges between H.J.B and Mr Kavala, this was because H.J.B. was highly skilled in the tactics and procedures used by the secret services.",
                "The prosecution also argued that on 6 November 2015 G.S. had come to Türkiye and had met Mr Kavala, who had taken a photograph of him with I.A. According to the prosecutor’s office, I.A., a businessman, was close to Mr Kavala, and was a representative of the Open Society Foundation in Türkiye and co-founder of the Foundation for an Open Society; he too had allegedly assisted Fetullah Gülen in obtaining his residence permit.",
                "Relying on the evidence set out above, the prosecutor’s office concluded that Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had committed the offences set out in Articles 309 and 328 of the Criminal Code."

In its reasoning, it referred to the request presented by the Istanbul prosecutor’s office on 9 March 2020 (see paragraph 31 above), the decision issued on the same date by the 10th Magistrate’s Court, ordering Mr Kavala’s placement in pre-trial detention in relation to military or political espionage (see paragraph 34 above), and the indictment of 28 September 2020 (see paragraph 36 above). It noted that additional research conducted by the prosecution service with regard to H.J.B. had resulted in evidence being gathered which suggested that he had conducted espionage activities for foreign States. With regard to Mr Kavala, it stated, among other points, that reference had been made to communications interception reports and the existence of links between H.J.B. and Mr Kavala. With regard to the indictment, it noted that the prosecutor’s office had relied on the following elements concerning the offence defined in Article 328 of the Criminal Code: the alleged contacts between Mr Kavala and H.J.B., the activities conducted by Mr Kavala through entities and organisations that were owned or managed by him, the flash drive seized from Mr Kavala and the recordings found on his mobile telephone. It also noted that, according to the investigative authorities, H.J.B. had conducted espionage against Türkiye and had sat on the management board of a foundation which had the head of the FETÖ/PDY as its honorary president.

Moreover, the facts that the constituent acts of such offences are often carried out in cooperation with the intelligence services of other countries and that the perpetrators of these offences are more skilled at hiding their actions than other suspects might necessitate the adoption of comparatively different standards with regard to the type and level of proof required, at least at the beginning of the investigation or when selecting preventive measures such as pre-trial detention.”",
                "The Constitutional Court considered, by a majority, that the evidence gathered by the investigative authorities and accepted by the magistrate’s court which had ordered Mr Kavala’s placement in pre-trial detention (see paragraphs 31-34 above) were sufficient to give rise to a strong suspicion with regard to the offence defined in Article 328 of the Criminal Code."

                "61. In his dissenting opinion, the President of the Constitutional Court stated that he had not found any evidence capable of justifying the suspicions against Mr Kavala, and that the latter’s pre-trial detention in relation to the offence of espionage was therefore, in his view, unlawful. He noted, firstly, that the suspicions of espionage were based on the links existing between Mr Kavala and H.J.B. However, the investigative authorities had been unable to provide any tangible evidence capable of rebutting Mr Kavala’s statements about his relations with H.J.B. In particular, certain abstract allegations, based on hypotheses, had been presented in the detention order and the indictment as established facts. In addition, even assuming that the alleged telephone conversations had taken place, no information about their content had been disclosed. He also considered that, given the constituent elements of the offence in question, it was problematic to accept as prosecution evidence the data about telephone conversations between Mr Kavala and H.J.B., who had been born in Istanbul and followed university courses in Turkish studies. In the president’s opinion, there was no evidence capable of supporting either a strong suspicion, or even a mere suspicion, with regard to the charges in question.",
                "The President of the Constitutional Court also stated that the constituent elements of this offence had not been established in the decisions concerning Mr Kavala’s pre-trial detention. He added that Mr Kavala was accused of having obtained information through the NGOs that he had created and supported, and that he had used this information against Türkiye and for the benefit of foreign States. In this connection, he emphasised that the NGOs’ central task was to conduct research and analysis, to prepare reports and to issue recommendations on the socio-economic and political problems facing the country. While he accepted that an NGO could indeed be used for the purpose of espionage, the allegation that an NGO was carrying out activities that could be described as espionage ought, in his opinion, to be substantiated by information, documents and tangible evidence, and not by abstract and general hypotheses. However, such evidence was absent in the present case.",
                "In his dissenting opinion, the President of the Constitutional Court also addressed the question of whether Mr Kavala had already been detained on the basis of the same evidence, and, if so, whether the second period of detention was linked to the previous charges. He found that it was. In his reasoning, he stated that the initial suspicions had been based on the ties that Mr Kavala was accused of having maintained with H.J.B. in 2013 and 2016. In his view, however, the investigative authorities had possessed this information from the outset of their work. This meant that the information accepted as evidence on 9 March 2020 had existed in general terms in the investigation file for more than three years. During this period, it had not proved possible to obtain any new information with regard to the nature of the presumed links which could justify placement in pre-trial detention on the charge of espionage. The President noted that the investigative authorities had been unable to explain why it had been necessary to order that Mr Kavala be placed in pre-trial detention more than three years after the existence of a link to H.J.B. had been established. For three years, on the basis of essentially the same evidence, the competent courts had ordered that Mr Kavala be placed in detention and his release on bail on three occasions and had acquitted him once. He observed that the existence of links between Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had been mentioned in all of the detention orders, from the very outset, and this element had been accepted as evidence from the first detention order referring to the existence of a strong suspicion of involvement in the attempted coup. He noted that the suspicion in question had been lifted, but that Mr Kavala had nonetheless been detained a second time, for the same offence, after he had been acquitted and his release on bail had been ordered in the context of the Gezi Park proceedings. Equally, the argument that there were ties between Mr Kavala and H.J.B. had also been used in the second detention order to justify the existence of a strong suspicion concerning another offence (Article 309 of the Criminal Code). Lastly, he noted that the third order for pre-trial detention on the charge relating to the offence set out in Article 328 of the Criminal Code, issued shortly after the second order for pre-trial detention, was again justified by this evidence."

                "62. In his dissenting opinion, the Deputy President of the Constitutional Court also criticised the lack of information about the content of the alleged contacts between Mr Kavala and H.J.B. He further stated that the other evidence referred to by the prosecutor’s office, namely, the documentary films found on the flash drive and Mr Kavala’s mobile telephone, were unrelated to the offence of espionage, since it had not been alleged that they contained confidential information. After commenting on the constituent elements of the offence defined in Article 328 of the Criminal Code, he specified that the subject matter of this offence was a “State secret”, that is, information that was classified as confidential and unknown to the public. In his view, information that had been obtained from open sources and was thus, by definition, available to the public, could not be considered as a “State secret”, and the prosecutor’s office ought therefore to have clarified the constituent elements of the offence in question, by replying to the following question: “what secret information, held by which State body, is at stake?” In his view, however, the prosecutor’s office had based its arguments solely on abstract assessments, which could not be considered as constituent elements, for the purposes of criminal law, of the offence identified in Article 328 of the Criminal Code. He concluded, firstly, that there was nothing in the materials submitted to the case file concerning Mr Kavala’s detention that could justify the suspicion in question, and, secondly, that this detention had no legal basis. He also criticised the proportionality of placing Mr Kavala in detention three years after having obtained the evidence referred to in the relevant decisions."

For his part, the third dissenting judge concluded that there was no fact, information or evidence capable of establishing that Mr Kavala had taken part in a criminal activity for the purposes of Article 328 of the Criminal Code. He essentially repeated the arguments already set out by the other dissenting judges, expressing also his concerns as to the conduct of Mr Kavala’s pre-trial detention. He stated that to accuse a person of espionage on the sole basis of evidence relating to the signals emitted by his telephone, and without any tangible evidence, could lead to worrying situations from the perspective of human rights. Referring to the relevant paragraph in the Kavala judgment (cited above, § 154), he argued that the prosecutor’s office had been unable to provide any element capable of showing that Mr Kavala’s meetings with H.J.B. had been particularly frequent, and that its argument had created an irrebuttable presumption in respect of the suspect. With regard to the statement by one of the witnesses, which, in his view, could be considered as a new element subsequent to the Court’s judgment, he noted that this individual’s statements had not concerned Mr Kavala. With regard to the other activities conducted by Mr Kavala in the context of his NGOs, this judge considered that these were legal activities. In his view, the prosecution’s approach was likely to lead to the criminalisation of activities conducted lawfully by NGOs. Lastly, he too held that the contested measure had been disproportionate."

In their joint dissenting opinion, the fourth and fifth dissenting judges began by reviewing the Constitutional Court’s relevant case-law, stating from the outset their view that the majority’s conclusion was not compatible with it. They considered, having regard to the criteria set out in that case-law, that the case disclosed serious flaws. The constituent elements of the offence defined in Article 328 of the Criminal Code (information or documents belonging to the State and falling by their nature under “State secrets”, and the fact or obtaining or disclosing such documents or information) had not been set out in the documents concerning Mr Kavala’s detention. In particular, they criticised the criterion developed in paragraph 92 of the Constitutional Court’s judgment (see paragraph 60 above). Were this approach to be followed, the detention measures applicable to certain types of offences would not be protected by the safeguards set out in the Constitution. They also argued that certain actions, which clearly did not constitute an offence, had been accepted as evidence with regard to the offence of espionage. They concluded that the case file did not contain any evidence of this offence and that the return to pre-trial detention of Mr Kavala, which moreover had not been based on any relevant and sufficient reason, had been disproportionate."

In the absence of a duly submitted claim, it decided not to make any award to the applicant under Article 41 of the Convention.

Under Article 15 of the Convention, it also considered that “the suspicion against him [had] not reach[ed] the required minimum level of reasonableness. Although imposed under judicial supervision, the contested measures were thus based on a mere suspicion”. It further held that the measures in question “[could] not be said to have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation” (ibid., §§ 157-158). The Court held as follows in paragraph 157:",

It further notes that the measures were essentially based not only on facts that cannot be reasonably considered as behaviour criminalised under domestic law, but also on facts which were largely related to the exercise of Convention rights. The very fact that such acts were included in the bill of indictment as the constituent elements of an offence in itself diminishes the reasonableness of the suspicions in question.”"

In addition, in view of the nature of the charges brought against the applicant, it held that the contested measures were likely to have a dissuasive effect on the work of human-rights defenders (ibid., §§ 230-232).

                "Secondly, the Court, in its assessment under Article 18, found it crucial that several years had elapsed between the events forming the basis for the applicant’s detention and the court decisions to detain him, with no plausible explanation given by the government for this lapse of time (§§ 225-228 of the judgment). Similarly, the accusations which form the basis of the present detention order, issued on 9 March 2020, relate to events prior to July 2016.",
                "Thirdly, again in reaching its conclusion under Article 18 that the criminal proceedings against the applicant pursued the ulterior purpose of reducing him to silence and dissuading other civil society activists, the Court found a link between the acts of the prosecutors and the timing and content of two speeches made by the President of the Republic of Turkey in which he named the applicant. It cannot but be observed that on the day the applicant was re-arrested, the President made another, similar speech, in which he also criticised the applicant’s acquittal, is, as the Commissioner of Human Rights commented, ‘a strong indication that the same dynamics are in operation’.",
                "Finally, the fact that the prosecutor decided to appeal against the acquittal, and that the Council of Public Prosecutors and Judges initiated an examination to verify the need for whether a disciplinary investigation against the three judges who delivered the acquittal judgment should be initiated, indicates that the authorities have not accepted the European Court’s findings. In this respect it is recalled that the execution of the Court’s judgments should involve good faith on the part of the respondent State and the importance of the good faith obligation is paramount where the Court has found a violation of Article 18...”",

The Parties to the Convention have a collective duty to preserve the Court’s authority – and thus the Convention system’s credibility and effectiveness – whenever the Committee of Ministers considers that one of the High Contracting Parties refuses, expressly or through its conduct, to comply with the Court’s final judgment in a case to which it is party.",

Currently the ultimate measure available to the Committee of Ministers is recourse to Article 8 of the Council of Europe’s Statute (suspension of voting rights in the Committee of Ministers, or even expulsion from the Organisation). This is an extreme measure, which would prove counter-productive in most cases; indeed the High Contracting Party which finds itself in the situation foreseen in paragraph 4 of Article 46 continues to need, far more than others, the discipline of the Council of Europe. The new Article 46 therefore adds further possibilities of bringing pressure to bear to the existing ones. The procedure’s mere existence, and the threat of using it, should act as an effective new incentive to execute the Court’s judgments.

They argued that Türkiye had complied with the Court’s judgment, and that no exceptional circumstances existed in the present case that could justify the referral in question. In this connection, they argued that the Committee’s decisions had been based on the assertion that “the information available to the Committee raise[d] a strong presumption that Mr Kavala’s current detention [was] a continuation of the violations found by the Court”, and that the Committee of Ministers had ruled on judicial proceedings which could only be assessed by the Court. However the Government considered that the Committee of Ministers had neither authority nor mandate to evaluate the evidence produced in the context of a case that was pending before the domestic courts, and that by embarking on the procedure set out in Article 46 § 4, the Committee of Ministers had not only interfered in the ongoing domestic proceedings, but it had also taken a position on a matter that might be brought before the Court in the context of a separate application.

He explained that on the evening of 18 February 2020, although his acquittal and release on bail had just been pronounced, he had been taken directly from prison to the Istanbul police headquarters, where he was held in conditions that he described as difficult and disagreeable until being brought before the magistrate’s court on the following day."

Having had the opportunity to examine all the evidence on which these two charges were based, the Court had clearly found that there was no evidence capable of reaching the threshold required by Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. In addition, the Court also found that the very exercise of his rights guaranteed by the Convention formed the basis of these charges and that his detention pursued an ulterior purpose of reducing him to silence. He considered that the decision ordering his release and acquittal of 25 April 2022 demonstrated that the charges under Article 328 of the Criminal Code had been manifestly unfounded, instrumentalised to keep him in detention until a new pre-trial detention order and a new conviction were obtained under Article 312 of the Criminal Code.

Equally, Mr Kavala considered that new indications were necessary in the present case, so that he could resume his activities in the area of human-rights protection and so that he and other human-rights defenders were no longer troubled by the abusive use of the criminal law on account of their activities in this field, given the dissuasive effect of his arbitrary detention on other human-rights defenders.

This procedure does not aim to reopen the question of violation, already decided in the Court’s first judgment. When introducing this procedure, it was felt that the political pressure exerted by proceedings for non-compliance before the Grand Chamber and by the latter’s judgment should suffice to secure execution of the Court’s initial judgment by the State concerned (see point no. 99 of the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 14, paragraph 104 above). Indeed, infringement proceedings should be brought only in “exceptional circumstances”, as provided for by Rule No. 11 and the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 14 (see paragraphs 103-104 above). This criterion is intended to indicate that the Committee of Ministers should apply a high threshold before launching this procedure. Infringement proceedings should therefore be viewed as a measure of last resort, where the Committee of Ministers considers that the other means to secure the execution of a judgment have ultimately proved unsuccessful and are no longer adapted to the situation. Moreover, infringement proceedings are not intended to upset the fundamental institutional balance between the Court and the Committee of Ministers (ibid., § 166).

Further, in view of the charges that were brought against the applicant, it considers that the contested measures were likely to have a dissuasive effect on the work of human-rights defenders. In consequence, it concludes that the restriction of the applicant’s liberty was applied for purposes other than bringing him before a competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, as prescribed by Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.",

Consequently, in the absence of other relevant and sufficient circumstances, a mere reclassification of the same facts cannot in principle modify the basis for those conclusions, since such a reclassification would only be a different assessment of facts already examined by the Court. Were it otherwise, the judicial authorities could continue to deprive individuals of their liberty simply by opening new criminal investigations in respect of the same facts. Such a situation would amount to permitting the law to be circumvented and might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Korban v.

However, as indicated in the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 14 (see paragraph 104 above), the infringement procedure does not aim to reopen before the Court the question of a violation, already decided in its first judgment. Nor does it provide for payment of a financial penalty by a High Contracting Party found to be in violation of Article 46 § 1. It follows that the Court is not competent to find a further violation of Articles 5 and 18 of the Convention. In reality, the finding of a violation of Article 46 § 1 means that the primary obligation resulting from the Court’s initial judgment, namely restitutio in integrum, with all the ensuing consequences, continues to exist, and that it is for the Committee of Ministers to continue to supervise the execution of the Court’s initial judgment."

                "176. With regard to Mr Kavala’s claims under Article 41 of the Convention (see paragraph 124 above), the Court considers that it is not competent to make an award in respect of any (pecuniary or non-pecuniary) damage sustained by the person concerned, given the nature of infringement proceedings as explained above (see paragraph 175). Given the outcome of the present infringement proceedings, the Court finds, however, that in the interest of the proper administration of justice, the costs and expenses relating to these proceedings are to be reimbursed to Mr Kavala by the Government, in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum, in accordance with the Court’s established case-law. The Court notes in this regard that Mr Kavala – as a person concerned by the present proceedings – was invited by the Court to submit written observations. The preparation of these observations by his representatives necessarily entailed costs for which Mr Kavala claimed reimbursement. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the material in the case file and the observations submitted by the Government and Mr Kavala, as well as the above-mentioned criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award Mr Kavala 7,500 euros (EUR) in respect of the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings before it. In this regard, it recalls that the Committee of Ministers is competent under Article 46 § 5 of the Convention to take the measures that it deems necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations arising from the Court’s finding of a violation of Article 46 § 1. The Court also considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.",

In January 2003 he sent to a newspaper two letters containing information about pressure put on the Prosecutor General ’ s Office by a high-ranking politician. In one of the letters, the Vice-President of Parliament expressed discontent that several police officers were being criminally prosecuted for allegedly ill-treating and unlawfully detaining suspects. In another letter it was stated that one of those police officers had previously been convicted of similar offences, but had been exempted from serving a sentence and had soon been re-employed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Subsequently, the newspaper published an article on the basis of the letters. The applicant was then dismissed by the Prosecutor General for having violated the internal regulations of the Press Department. In proceedings for his reinstatement brought against the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, he argued before the domestic courts that the disclosure of the letters had been in good faith and had pursued the aim of “fighting corruption and trading in influence ”. He argued that, in any event, the letters could not be classified as secret under domestic law. The domestic courts found in favour of the applicant ’ s employer, on the grounds that the applicant had breached his duty of confidentiality by disclosing the letters, and that he had failed to consult other heads of departments before disclosing the letters to the newspaper."

As to whether the measure had been “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of that provision, the Court noted firstly that the applicant had not had alternative channels for disclosing the letters, and that, in the circumstances of the case, external reporting, even to a newspaper, could be justified. Against that background, it also found that the information disclosed by the applicant was of major public interest, because it concerned such issues as the separation of powers, improper conduct by a high-ranking politician, and the government ’ s attitude towards police brutality. Balancing the different issues involved, the Court also took into consideration the detriment caused to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office by the disclosure. In doing so, the Court came to the conclusion that the public interest in having information about undue pressure and wrongdoing within the Prosecutor General ’ s Office revealed was so important in a democratic society that it outweighed the interest in maintaining public confidence in the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. Lastly, the Court noted that the applicant had acted in good faith and that the most severe sanction possible had been imposed on him. In view of all the considerations, the Court came to the conclusion that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression, in particular his right to impart information, had not been “necessary in a democratic society”, and that there had been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention."

As for the applicant ’ s complaint in the present case, the Court notes that it relates to his being dismissed once again and to the reasons given by the domestic courts for dismissing his reinstatement action. That being so, the applicant ’ s second dismissal from his employment and the new proceedings concerning his reinstatement constitute new information in relation to the Court ’ s previous judgment.

                "47. In interpreting and applying Article 10 of the Convention in the context of the workplace, the Court relied on the following general principles in Guja (cited above, § § 69-78 ):",
                "“ (i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfillment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "70. The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace, and that civil servants, such as the applicant, enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 52 above). At the same time, the Court is mindful that employees have a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion to their employer. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002).",
                "71. Since the mission of civil servants in a democratic society is to assist the government in discharging its functions and since the public has a right to expect that they will help and not hinder the democratically elected government, the duty of loyalty and reserve assumes special significance for them (see, mutatis mutandis, Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 53.) In addition, in view of the very nature of their position, civil servants often have access to information which the government, for various legitimate reasons, may have an interest in keeping confidential or secret. Therefore, the duty of discretion owed by civil servants will also generally be a strong one.",
                "72. ... the Court notes that a civil servant, in the course of his work, may become aware of in-house information, including secret information, whose divulgation or publication corresponds to a strong public interest. The Court thus considers that the signaling by a civil servant or an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should, in certain circumstances, enjoy protection. This may be called for where the employee or civil servant concerned is the only person, or part of a small category of persons, aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large.",
                "73. In the light of the duty of discretion referred to above, disclosure should be made in the first place to the person ’ s superior or other competent authority or body. It is only where this is clearly impracticable that the information could, as a last resort, be disclosed to the public (see, mutatis mutandis, Haseldine, cited above). In assessing whether the restriction on freedom of expression was proportionate, therefore, the Court must take into account whether there was available to the applicant any other effective means of remedying the wrongdoing which he intended to uncover.",
                "74. In determining the proportionality of an interference with a civil servant ’ s freedom of expression in such a case, the Court must also have regard to a number of other factors. In the first place, particular attention shall be paid to the public interest involved in the disclosed information. The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see, among other authorities, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV). In a democratic system, the acts or omissions of government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of the media and public opinion. The interest which the public may have in particular information can sometimes be so strong as to override even a legally imposed duty of confidence (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, and Radio Twist, a.s. v. Slovakia, no. 62202/00, ECHR 2006-XV).",
                "75. The second factor relevant to this balancing exercise is the authenticity of the information disclosed. It is open to the competent State authorities to adopt measures intended to react appropriately and without excess to defamatory accusations devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 46, Series A no. 236). Moreover, freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify, to the extent permitted by the circumstances, that it is accurate and reliable (see, mutatis mutandis, Morissens v. Belgium, no. 11389/85, Commission decision of 3 May 1988, DR 56, p. 127, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ III).",
                "76. On the other side of the scales, the Court must weigh the damage, if any, suffered by the public authority as a result of the disclosure in question and assess whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed (see, mutatis mutandis, Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16 December 1992, § 45, Series A no. 252, and Stoll, cited above, § 130). In this connection, the subject matter of the disclosure and the nature of the administrative authority concerned may be relevant (see Haseldine, cited above).",
                "77. The motive behind the actions of the reporting employee is another determinant factor in deciding whether a particular disclosure should be protected or not. For instance an act motivated by a personal grievance or a personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage, including pecuniary gain, would not justify a particularly strong level of protection (ibid.). It is important to establish that, in making the disclosure, the individual acted in good faith and in the belief that the information was true, that it was in the public interest to disclose it and that no other, more discreet, means of remedying the wrongdoing was available to him or her.",
                "78. Lastly, in connection with the review of the proportionality of the interference in relation to the legitimate aim pursued, attentive analysis of the penalty imposed on the applicant and its consequences is required (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 49). ”"

As stated above, it is for the State concerned to decide, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, what measures are most appropriate in the context of executing the Court ’ s judgment in any given case.

As interpreted by the Court of Appeal in its decision of 17 December 2008 (see paragraph 1 9 above), that section gave the newly appointed Prosecutor General the power to dismiss the applicant, rather than imposed an obligation on him to do so. Moreover, as indicated by the applicant ’ s submissions, which were not disputed by either the Government in the proceedings before the Court or by the Prosecutor General ’ s Office in the domestic proceedings, the applicant was the first employee of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office to be dismissed on the basis of that provision.

In particular, they could have presented a copy of the applicant ’ s badge permitting him access to the building of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, or any other documents proving that the applicant received a badge. Similarly, the applicant must have left traces of his work or work - related activities during his ten days of employment, which could have been presented in support of the Government ’ s allegations."

The manner in which the events unfolded and their timing could make an independent observer reasonably conclude that the applicant ’ s second dismissal was not unrelated with the events of 2003. In fact, the Prosecutor General did not even attempt to maintain the impression of a simple labour dispute. Instead, he acted in such a way as to make it obvious to the applicant and others that the applicant was no longer welcome to work at his old workplace. Here the Court wishes to stress that the obligation to reinstate does not preclude future dismissal on another, justified ground unrelated to the original dismissal (see, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Others v.

Moreover, what is of great importance for the Court in the present case is the fact that the domestic courts did not react in any way to the applicant ’ s allegations that his dismissal was in fact an attempt by the authorities to dispose of an employee whom they deemed inconvenient in the light of the events of 2003. The courts paid no attention at all to the applicant ’ s allegations concerning the treatment to which he had been subjected during his ten days of employment. They did not examine whether the dismissal constituted an interference with the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 10, or whether the decision to dismiss the applicant again under section 14(8) of the Public Service Act was justified under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, bearing in mind the events of 2003 and the Guja judgment."

The available information showed that the applicant followed strictly the organisation’s ideas and would unhesitatingly follow the orders of its leaders.

In its early case ‑ law under that provision, the Supreme Administrative Court accepted that the State Refugees Agency could apply it when dealing with asylum requests (реш. № 5848 от 17 юни 2002 г. по адм. д. № 7864/2001 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 6048 от 24 юни 2002 г. по адм. д. № 1298/2002 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 7102 от 16 юли 2002 г. по адм. д. № 994/2002 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 9203 от 16 октомври 2002 г. по адм. д. № 4948/2002 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 10069 от 12 ноември 2002 г. по адм. д. № 996/2002 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.).

                "52. There are twelve “official” Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon: two in the north of the country, near Tripoli, five in the centre (four near Beirut and one near Baalbek), and five in the south (two near Saida and three near Tyre). In addition, there are dozens of informal gatherings, sometimes referred to as “unofficial camps”, spread throughout the country. The majority of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are those displaced during the Arab ‑ Israeli war of 1948 and their descendants. More Palestinians arrived in 1967 after the Six ‑ Day War, and in the 1970s after they were expelled from Jordan. The refugees fall into three categories: those registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (“the UNRWA”) (“registered refugees”), who are also registered with the Lebanese authorities; refugees registered with the Lebanese authorities but not with the UNRWA (“non-registered refugees”); and refugees registered neither with the UNRWA nor with the Lebanese authorities (“non ‑ ID refugees”). According to the UNRWA, on 30 June 2010 there were 427,057 registered refugees in Lebanon; 226,767, or 53.1% of them, were living in the “official” camps. However, according to a report by the International Crisis Group (see paragraphs 76 and 77 below), many observers believe that the numbers cited by the UNRWA are inflated and fail to take account of the impact of the 1975 ‑ 90 Lebanese Civil War and subsequent waves of Palestinian departures; according to their estimates, in 2009 the refugees were between 200,000 and 250,000. There are an estimated 10,000 to 35,000 non ‑ registered refugees and 3,000 to 5,000 non ‑ ID refugees. By law, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are considered foreigners and are subject to various restrictions (for details, see Amnesty International: Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, October 2007)."

The Tahalof consisted of seven factions, including the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Palestinian Liberation Organization faction was made up of five groups and was dominated by Fatah. The Islamic faction comprised three groups: Asbat al ‑ Ansar, Harakat Mujahideen Islamiyah, and Ansar Allah.

Mounir Maqdah against Yasser Arafat’s command. With Iranian finances and Hezbollah logistical support, he began training his own militia and ‘By 1995, Maqdah’s dissident faction [the Black September 13 Brigade], backed by pro ‑ Syrian leftist groups, had established dominance over mainstream Fatah forces in the camp, in part because many of Arafat’s most loyal commanders had been transferred to the West Bank and Gaza.’ MEIB noted that ‘Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which had only a limited presence in the camp until the mid ‑ 1990s, coordinated closely with Maqdah and were allowed to distribute Iranian funds to expand their bases of support.’",

The group’s military wing, which now paid recruits monthly salaries for the first time, grew to a force of 150 ‑ 300 fighters, dozens of whom were sent to bin Laden’s training camps in Afghanistan.’ Due to its increased financial resources, the group was able to buy weapons and also move more freely, as members could now pay the bribes needed to pass through Lebanese security checkpoints.

However, with the in absentia conviction of Fatah’s leader in Lebanon, Sultan Abu al ‑ Aynayn [based in Rashidieh camp], of forming an armed gang and the subsequent arrest of three senior Fatah officials, Syrian support of Fatah’s authority in Ein el-Hilweh was again curtailed, seemingly in favour of Esbat al ‑ Ansar.",

However, the camp was “a microcosm of the Palestinian political universe”, with all PLO, Tahaluf and Jihadi factions being represented and perpetually competing for influence and power, which resulted in frequent clashes. Palestinian militant groups continued to capitalise on the lack of government control within the camps. Some of those groups, such as Usbat al ‑ Ansar and Jund al ‑ Sham, had been able to find safe haven within the camps, most notably in Ain al ‑ Hilweh. In March 2008 heavy clashes had erupted in the camp between Jund al ‑ Sham militants and fighters of Fatah. They had exchanged rocket fire for four hours until a ceasefire had been agreed following mediation by another Islamist group. A Fatah leader had said at least four people had been wounded in the clashes. The Jund al ‑ Sham fighters would leave the camp and Fatah security agents would take control. The Lebanese army had blocked the entrance to the camp while allowing civilians to leave. A Palestinian official had said that the militants of Jund al-Sham had been angered by Fatah’s seizure of a commander of the group and his handover to the Lebanese army. The captive had been suspected of links to militant groups outside Lebanon. On 15 September 2008 a Jund al ‑ Sham member had been killed in further clashes between the group and Fatah. Reports had said the Lebanese army had taken up positions at the entrance of the camp just metres away from the fighting."

                "“In assessing any risk from the Lebanese authorities to those who claim to have been a member of an armed Palestinian group, the type of group and level of involvement will need to be considered. Consideration should also be given to the reasons for leaving a refugee camp and how the claimant was able to avoid the authorities when leaving Lebanon. In general, the Lebanese authorities do not enter Palestinian camps.",
                "Palestinian groups operate autonomously in refugee camps and in the majority of cases would be able to offer the protection needed from within these camps. Claimants who have not been directly involved in criminal or militant acts and who support more moderate groups, such as Fatah, are unlikely to have come to the attention of or be of interest to the Lebanese authorities. A grant of asylum or Humanitarian Protection would not usually be appropriate in such cases. However, if it is accepted that the claimant has been involved in armed groups of particular interest to the Lebanese authorities, such as the Abu Nidal Organisation, Asbat Al ‑ Ansar/Al Nur and Jund al ‑ Sham, or can otherwise demonstrate adverse interest and inability to access protection, it may be appropriate to grant asylum.",
                "Case owners should note that members of armed Palestinian groups have been responsible for numerous serious human rights abuses. If it is accepted that a claimant was an active operational member or combatant of an armed Palestinian group and the evidence suggests he/she has been involved in such actions, then case owners should consider whether one of the Exclusion clauses is applicable. Case owners should refer such cases to a Senior Caseworker in the first instance.”"

                "62. With regard to claims based on fear of Islamic Palestinian Groups in the Ain al ‑ Hilweh, such as Usbat al-Ansar, Jund al-Sham, or the Fatah Revolutionary Council (also known as Abu Nidal Organisation), the OGN observed that although Fatah’s control was weak, claimants could seek their protection. It went on to note that the refugee camps were outside the government’s control, which meant that in those areas the Lebanese authorities would not be able to offer sufficiency of protection from extremist Palestinian groups. However, the authorities would be able to offer protection outside the camps. A further option was internal relocation. Since the threat was localised in specific camps, relocation to another camp or elsewhere in Lebanon was feasible and not unduly harsh. In that respect, the OGN referred to two immigration tribunal rulings: BS (Palestinian – Lebanon – relocation) Lebanon [2005] UKIAT 00004, and MA (Lebanon/Palestine, fear of Fatah, relocation) Palestine [2004] UKIAT 00112, and reached the following conclusion:",
                "“Within the [A]in [a]l ‑ Hilweh camp there have been in the past, and continue to be, various factions of extremist Palestinian groups struggling for power leading to occasional outbreaks of violence. In individual cases consideration needs to be given as to why the claimant would be of interest to the extremist Palestinian groups and the level of that interest. The Tribunal have found that it is not unduly harsh to relocate between camps in Lebanon. Many of the most extreme groups have limited support in Lebanon, especially outside the refugee camps. It is therefore considered that a claimant could find safety in another camp or elsewhere in Lebanon where the specific extremist Palestinian group he fears does not have a significant presence. Protection may also be available to the claimant from other Palestinian groups, particularly Fatah. Therefore a grant of asylum or Humanitarian Protection would not usually be appropriate for claims on this basis.”"

                "63. With regard to claims based on fear of Palestinian groups on account of collaboration with their enemies, the OGN observed that, since the Government of Lebanon did not exercise control over the Palestinian refugee camps, armed groups could operate relatively freely there. Therefore, sufficiency of protection would not generally be available from the Lebanese authorities inside the camps. For those who feared persecution at the hands of a rival group, protection inside the refugee camp could be available from another group. There was no evidence to show that the Lebanese authorities would be unwilling or unable to offer protection outside the refugee camps to those fearing Palestinian groups. Another option was internal relocation. The law provided for freedom of movement, and the Lebanese authorities generally respected that right, with some limitations. They maintained security checkpoints, primarily in military and other restricted areas. There were few police checkpoints on main roads or in populated areas. The security services used those checkpoints to conduct warrantless searches for smuggled goods, weapons, narcotics, and subversive literature. Few Palestinian groups had influence outside the refugee camps and relocation to another camp or elsewhere in Lebanon was not likely to be unduly harsh. In that respect, the OGN referred to the above ‑ mentioned ruling in BS (Palestinian – Lebanon – relocation) Lebanon [2005] UKIAT 00004, and to the ruling in WD (Lebanon – Palestinian – ANO – risk) Lebanon CG [2008] UKAIT 00047, and concluded as follows:",
                "“Consideration needs to be given to the level of involvement as a collaborator, who the claimant worked for, what information the claimant was in a position to give and their position in that group. In the majority of cases within the refugee camps the Lebanese authorities would not be able to provide sufficiency of protection. However, few Palestinian groups have influence outside the refugee camps and the Lebanese authorities would be in a position to offer sufficiency of protection in the remainder of the country. However if the claimant is a known Israeli collaborator the Lebanese authorities might not offer protection. Internal relocation to another camp away from a particular Palestinian group feared would not be unduly harsh. Therefore in the majority of cases a grant of asylum or [h]umanitarian [p]rotection would not usually be appropriate.”",

Nevertheless, a porous border with Syria, weak internal camp security, and LAF reluctance to enter the Palestinian refugee camps all contributed to fears of another confrontation with an armed group, similar to the 2007 Nahr al ‑ Barid conflict. The most widely predicted venue for such a clash is in Lebanon’s most populous refugee camp, Ain al-Hilweh, near the southern city of Sidon.

The collapse of the peace process in the late 1990s intensified the process. Taking advantage of young refugees’ identity crisis, socioeconomic despair and leadership vacuum, groups such as Jund al ‑ Sham, Usbat al ‑ Ansar, Usbat al ‑ Nour, al ‑ Haraka al ‑ Islamiyya al ‑ Mujahida and, more recently, Fatah al ‑ Islam, prospered.

The report said that the group was based in a small stretch of no ‑ man’s ‑ land known as Taamir, between the boundary of Ain al ‑ Hilweh and one of the Lebanese Army checkpoints that overlooked the camp. Following the attack, Ansar Allah, another Palestinian Islamist group, had been tasked with heading an eighty ‑ member security force to control two of the camp border checkpoints, including the one overlooking the Jund al ‑ Sham stronghold. The other camp border checkpoints, as well as security inside the camp, had remained the task of Fatah. The report went on to say that Fatah militants had had regular deadly clashes with Jund al ‑ Sham over the previous six months, and also faced a challenge from other armed and more radical Palestinian groups, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command or Usbat al ‑ Ansar."

After talks, Usbat al-Ansar leaders had given Issa a free mandate to annihilate the threat he said jihadists and radicals posed to the camp’s security. Issa was quoted as saying that “[a]fter some battles with these factions, some died, many of them were captured and handed over to the Lebanese authorities, and those that were left fled. These groups took advantage of the instability in Lebanon and infiltrated the camp, and when we realized that they were among suspects in explosions taking place around stores, we started dealing with them with security means, we captured many of them, went to battle with some, and some, like I said, fled”. He had also said that some of the jihadists had left for Europe, adding that “[t]hey were originally in the ‘emergency’ area [at the outskirts of the camp] and started fleeing bit by bit. Some left to France, some to Belgium, some to Sofia in Bulgaria”. He had said that in mid ‑ December 2010, five of the runaways had been sent back to Lebanon by the Bulgarian authorities. Among them had been Youssef Kayed, a rogue former Fatah member who had rebelled against the central command, Anwar al ‑ Sidawi and Imad Karroum, both wanted by the Lebanese authorities.

The Government submitted that the applicant’s fears were groundless in view of the prohibition in section 44a of the Aliens Act 1998 on the expulsion of aliens to a country where their health or life would be in jeopardy. The order to expel him had been intended to protect the national security of Bulgaria. However, its enforcement was subject to the provisions of section 44a, which coincided with the principles underlying Articles 2, 3 and 5 of the Convention. The practice in such cases was for the competent authorities, which worked in close cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and non ‑ governmental organisations, to verify the issue upon expulsion of their own motion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs kept an updated list of safe third countries that could receive individuals in the applicant’s position. The authorities were thus complying with the absolute prohibition of Article 3 of the Convention, and, unlike the situation obtaining in Saadi v. Italy ([GC], no. 37201/06, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...), were not seeking to balance national security considerations against the risk of ill ‑ treatment faced by the applicant.

The only opportunity for him to invoke that provision to prevent his expulsion to Lebanon had been in the proceedings for judicial review of the expulsion order. However, the Supreme Administrative Court had held that the point was irrelevant. In any event, the only procedure in which the applicant could prove that he risked death or ill ‑ treatment were asylum proceedings. When examining his asylum request, the State Refugees Agency had found that risk to be real, based as it was on the applicant’s personal circumstances and the general situation in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. On that account it had granted him humanitarian protection. The risk could therefore be regarded as established. However, he could not benefit from such protection, as he fell within the exclusion clauses of sections 4(4) and 67(3) of the Asylum and Refugees Act of 2002."

Since the Government appear to contest that the applicant is at risk of being expelled to a country where he may face treatment contrary to Article 3, the Court must first examine his victim status. It notes, firstly, that the order for his expulsion, having been upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court, is final and enforceable (see, mutatis mutandis, Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 358, ECHR 2005 ‑ III; Abdulazhon Isakov v. Russia, no. 14049/08, § 100, 8 July 2010; Karimov v. Russia, no. 54219/08, § 90, 29 July 2010; and Kolesnik v.

Secondly, although issued more than a year and a half ago, it continues to have full legal effect (contrast Benamar and Others v. France (dec.), no. 42216/98, 14 November 2000). Lastly, there is no indication that the authorities have suspended its enforcement (contrast Andrić v. Sweden (dec.), no. 45917/99, 23 February 1999), or that it is possible to challenge its enforcement (contrast Kalantari v. Germany (striking out), no. 51342/99, § 56, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; and Yildiz v. Germany (dec.), no. 40932/02, 13 October 2005). The question whether the bar in section 44a of the Aliens Act 1998 on the expulsion of aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be in danger or where they may face a risk of ill ‑ treatment (see paragraph 38 above) would in fact prevent the applicant’s removal to Lebanon goes to the merits of the case (see Boutagni v. France, no. 42360/08, §§ 47 ‑ 48, 18 November 2010).

                "(a) As a matter of well ‑ established international law, and subject to their treaty obligations, including those arising from the Convention, Contracting States have the right to control the entry, residence and removal of aliens. Neither the Convention nor its Protocols confer the right to political asylum.",
                "(b) However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case that provision implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to a country where he or she would face such a risk.",
                "(c) In this type of case the Court is therefore called upon to assess the situation in the receiving country in the light of the requirements of Article 3. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the Contracting State, by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to the risk of proscribed ill ‑ treatment.",
                "(d) Article 3, which prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic societies. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15, even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation. As the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute, irrespective of the victim’s conduct, the nature of any offences allegedly committed by the applicant is therefore irrelevant."

Its examination of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one.",

Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it.",
                "(c) To determine whether there is a risk of ill ‑ treatment, the Court must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his or her personal circumstances.",
                "(d) To that end, as regards the general situation in a particular country, the Court has often attached importance to the information contained in recent reports from independent international human ‑ rights organisations such as Amnesty International, or governmental sources, including the United States Department of State. At the same time, it has held that the mere possibility of ill ‑ treatment on account of an unsettled situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3, and that, where the sources available to it describe a general situation, an applicant’s specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence.",
                "(e) In cases where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of ill ‑ treatment, the protection of Article 3 enters into play when the applicant establishes, where necessary on the basis of the sources mentioned in the previous subparagraph, that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned.",
                "(f) With regard to the material date, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of expulsion. However, if the applicant has not yet been removed when the Court examines the case, the relevant time will be that of the Court’s examination. Accordingly, while historical facts are of interest in so far as they shed light on the current situation and the way it is likely to develop, the present circumstances are decisive."

In paragraphs 140 ‑ 42 of the same judgment the Court, in response to arguments by certain governments in relation to the standard of proof in such matters, reaffirmed that for a planned expulsion by a Contracting State to be in breach of the Convention, it is sufficient for substantial grounds to have been shown for believing that there is a real risk that the person concerned will be subjected in the receiving country to treatment prohibited by Article 3, even where he or she is regarded as presenting a threat to the Contracting State’s national security."

Thus, any considerations in the present case having to do with the question whether the applicant presents a risk to the national security of Bulgaria are irrelevant for the Court’s examination.

Russia, no. 2947/06, § 126, 24 April 2008). The Court notes in this connection that the Supreme Administrative Court did not attempt to assess the question of risk, confining itself to the question of the lawfulness of the expulsion order. It is a matter of regret that that court found the applicant’s statement about the risk which he faced if he were to be returned to Lebanon “irrelevant for the ... proceedings” (see paragraph 23 above). Not only does the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court not assist the Court in the assessment of the risk, such approach cannot be considered compatible with the need for independent and rigorous scrutiny of the substance of the applicant’s fears, which were plainly arguable in the light of the opinion delivered by the State Refugees Agency (see paragraph 11 above). The Court will revert to this matter in the context of Articles 13 and 46 (see paragraphs 121 and 139 below).

When considering that question on 29 October 2009, the State Refugees Agency was satisfied that there existed substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk that the applicant would face ill ‑ treatment or death in Lebanon, and granted him humanitarian protection, based, firstly, on his particular circumstances and, secondly, on the general situation in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. Its decision mainly relied on the fact that the applicant had been a member of Fatah and had been personally engaged in a violent conflict with members of a militant group (Jund al ‑ Sham) operating in the Palestinian refugee camp (Ain al ‑ Hilweh) where he had lived (see paragraph 11 above). Those findings carry significant weight, for two reasons. First, that Agency is a specialised body with particular expertise in this domain. Secondly, its officers were able to conduct a personal interview with the applicant. They had an opportunity to see, hear and assess his demeanour, and were thus in a position to test the credibility of his fears and the veracity of his account (see, mutatis mutandis, Ahmed v. Austria, 17 December 1996, § 42, Reports 1996 ‑ VI; Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII; Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no. 30471/08, §§ 82 ‑ 83, 22 September 2009; and R.C. v.

                "103. Moreover, this evidence cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, it must be assessed against the background of the available information on the situation in Lebanon and that of the Palestinian refugees there. It is true that the situation in the country as a whole does not appear so serious that the return of the applicant there would constitute, in itself, a breach of Article 3 (see paragraph 58 above). However, it cannot be overlooked that the applicant is a stateless Palestinian originating from a refugee camp in Lebanon (see paragraphs 1 and 7 above). There is therefore a likelihood that he would not be allowed to reside in Lebanon proper, but would have to return to the camp from which he fled, Ain al ‑ Hilweh. The information available on the Palestinian refugee camps in general and Ain al ‑ Hilweh in particular (see paragraphs 52 ‑ 55, 60, 62, 65 ‑ 73, 77, 78, 80 and 82 ‑ 88 above) shows that they are not under the control of the Lebanese authorities, but of various Palestinian armed factions. They are secluded from the rest of the country, are often surrounded by Lebanese army checkpoints, and have been described in reports as “beyond the [S]tate’s reach”, “ de facto sanctuaries for weapons” and “a safe heaven for those who seek to escape the authority of the State”. They continue to be plagued by outbursts of violence and armed clashes between various factions. Ain al ‑ Hilweh, which is very densely populated and not under the control of any single faction, appears to be one of the more chaotic and violent camps, where Fatah and various radical Islamist groups have for decades been engaged in a conflict of varying degrees of intensity. Since 2007, there has been a string of violent clashes between Fatah and Jund al ‑ Sham, which is reported to have about fifty armed men at its disposal. Although in late 2010 the Jund al ‑ Sham suffered some setbacks, including the death of a leader, it reengaged in armed clashes with Fatah in March and April of this year. In addition, there appear to exist power struggles within the ranks of Fatah itself. They, together with corruption within the movement, have apparently contributed to various security breakdowns. One of those internal divisions is pitting the applicant’s purported “protector”, Mounir Maqdah (see paragraph 9 above), against other figures in Fatah. It is therefore not readily apparent that Fatah, despite its relative dominance in Ain al ‑ Hilweh, would be able to provide the applicant with effective protection. Nor is it apparent that the applicant would be able to settle in another Palestinian refugee camp. Fatah apparently does not have strong positions in the camps in northern Lebanon, where the radical Islamist groups are more powerful. Those circumstances, coupled with the applicant’s personal account, amount to at least prima facie evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if expelled to Lebanon. Having regard to the information referred to above, the Court is not persuaded that the situation has evolved to an extent that the findings made by the State Refugees Agency in October 2009 on the question of risk are no longer valid. Indeed, as recently as 19 April 2011 the Secretary ‑ General of the United Nations reported on violent clashes in Ain al ‑ Hilweh and estimated that there still existed a threat of violence inside the Palestinian refugee camps (see paragraph 73 above). The burden is therefore on the State to dispel any doubts in that regard."

In that connection, it is noteworthy that when issuing and reviewing the decision to expel the applicant, the competent domestic authorities and courts did not try to make any assessment of that risk. The expulsion order and the proposal for one to be issued gave no consideration to this matter (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). In the ensuing judicial review proceedings, the Supreme Administrative Court expressly stated that the applicant’s fear that his life would be at risk in Lebanon was irrelevant (see paragraph 23 above). The Court is therefore unable to conclude that the Bulgarian authorities have duly addressed the applicant’s concerns with regard to Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Khodzhayev v. Russia, no. 52466/08, § 104, 12 May 2010, and Khaydarov v. Russia, no. 21055/09, §§ 112 ‑ 14, 20 May 2010). Their uncorroborated assertions that he is not who he says he is, but is a member of a militant Jihadist organisation who is sought by the Lebanese authorities in connection with a number of assassinations (see paragraphs 14, 22, 23 and 87 above) show, if anything, that he may be at even greater risk of ill ‑ treatment, by the Lebanese authorities themselves. There are a number of reports indicating that those authorities are likely to ill ‑ treat persons suspected of involvement with such groups (see paragraphs 61, 64, 74 and 75 and above). There is no indication that the Government have sought or obtained any form of assurance on the part of Lebanon in relation to such matters. In any event, the existence of assurances does not absolve a Contracting State from its obligation to consider their practical application (see, among other authorities, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, § 106, 6 July 2010)."

They explained that the practice in such cases was for the authorities to verify the matter when executing the expulsion order, and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs kept an updated list of safe third countries that could receive individuals in the applicant’s position. However, the Court does not consider that the Government’s statement can be regarded as a binding assurance that the applicant will not be expelled to Lebanon, for two reasons. First, in contrast to the express assurances given by the French Government in Boutagni (cited above, §§ 20 and 42), in the present case the Government did not declare that the applicant would not be removed to Lebanon, but merely said that the point would be examined at the time of the execution of the expulsion order. Secondly, the Government’s statement is not based on, or reflected in, a binding legal act (contrast Boutagni, cited above, §§ 19 ‑ 20 and 47 ‑ 48), and it is unclear whether it can of itself bind the authorities responsible for executing the expulsion order (see, mutatis mutandis, Shamayev and Others, cited above, §§ 344 ‑ 45)."

Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 286, 21 January 2011). It is not persuaded that, if and when they proceed with the applicant’s expulsion, the Bulgarian authorities will examine with the necessary rigour whether his return to Lebanon would put him at risk of treatment prohibited under Article 3 (contrast M.H. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 10641/08, §§ 25 and 41, 21 October 2008). The Government did not provide any particulars about the manner in which the immigration authorities apply section 44a when implementing expulsion orders, and did not give any concrete examples. The Aliens Act 1998 and the regulations for its application are silent on this point, and there are no reported cases (see paragraph 38 in fine above). It is thus unclear by reference to what standards and on the basis of what information the authorities will make a determination, if any, of the risk faced by the applicant if removed to Lebanon. Nor is there any indication as to whether, if the authorities choose to send the applicant to a third country, they will properly examine whether he would in turn be sent from there to Lebanon without due consideration for the risk of ill ‑ treatment. The Court reiterates that under its case ‑ law removal to an intermediary country does not affect the responsibility of the expelling State to ensure that the applicant is not exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3 as a result of the decision to expel (see T.I. v. the United Kingdom, cited above; Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 141; K.R.S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 32733/08, 2 December 2008; Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, § 88; Babar Ahmad and Others, cited above, §§ 113 ‑ 16; and M.S.S. v.

Firstly, it imperatively requires close, independent and rigorous scrutiny of the claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 293, with further references). That scrutiny must be carried out without regard to what the person may have done to warrant expulsion or to any perceived threat to the national security of the expelling State (see Chahal, cited above, 151 in fine ). The second requirement is that the person concerned should have access to a remedy with automatic suspensive effect (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, §§ 81 ‑ 83, ECHR 2002 ‑ I, and Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, § 66 in fine, ECHR 2007 ‑ II; Muminov v.

Concerning the “scrutiny” requirement, the Court observes that when examining the applicant’s legal challenge against the order for his expulsion, the Supreme Administrative Court expressly refused to deal with the question of risk, saying that any threat to the applicant in Lebanon was irrelevant for determining the lawfulness of his expulsion (compare with Jabari, cited above, § 49). As for the “suspensive effect” requirement, it should be noted that under Bulgarian law applications for judicial review of expulsion orders issued on national security grounds do not have automatic suspensive effect (see paragraph 35 above). It furthermore appears that the courts have no power to suspend the enforcement of such orders, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill ‑ treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 31, 34 and 37 above). The proceedings for judicial review of the expulsion order against the applicant cannot therefore be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of his grievance under Article 3."

However, the Court has already found that there are no guarantees that before proceeding with the expulsion the authorities would subject the applicant’s claims under Article 3 of the Convention to rigorous scrutiny (see paragraphs 105 and 106 above). More importantly, the Government did not point to any procedure whereby the applicant would be able to challenge their assessment of those claims. From the provisions of the Aliens Act 1998 and the regulations for its application it does not appear that it is possible to bring a separate legal challenge against the enforcement of the expulsion order, let alone that there exists an avenue of redress that meets the two requirements set out in paragraph 120 above. The Court would emphasise in that connection that the existence of remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, and that it falls to the respondent State to establish that (see, among other authorities, McFarlane v.

On the merits, the Court reiterates that Article 5 § 1 (f), which permits the State to control the liberty of aliens in the immigration context, does not demand that detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example, to prevent the individual from committing an offence or fleeing. Any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (f) will be justified, however, only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under that provision (see, among other authorities, Chahal, § 113; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, § 164; Mikolenko v. Estonia, no. 10664/05, § 63, 8 October 2009; and Raza, § 72, all cited above).

Indeed, a similar point was recently made by the ECJ in relation to Article 15 of Directive 2008/115/EC (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). It should, however, be pointed out that unlike that provision, Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention does not contain maximum time ‑ limits; the question whether the length of deportation proceedings could affect the lawfulness of detention under this provision thus depends solely on the particular circumstances of each case (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, no. 15933/89, Commission decision of 14 January 1991, unreported, and Gordyeyev v.

As a result, the applicant spent exactly eighteen months in custody, the maximum period allowed by law. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, compliance with that time ‑ limit, which is in any event exceptional (see paragraphs 47, 48, 50 and 51 above), cannot automatically be regarded as bringing the applicant’s detention into line with Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention.

Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, legal certainty must be strictly complied with in respect of each and every element relevant to the justification of the detention under domestic and Convention law.

Under Article 46, the Contracting Parties have undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in cases to which they are parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto imposes on the respondent State the legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction pursuant to Article 41 of the Convention but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if necessary, individual measures which it considers appropriate to incorporate into domestic law in order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress as far as possible the effects. It is primarily for the State concerned to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the means to be used under its domestic law to comply with that obligation. However, with a view to helping the respondent State in that task, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see, among other authorities, Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, §§ 254-55, ECHR 2012; Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 158, ECHR 2014; and Simeonovi v.

The Court notes that the Russian domestic framework for authorising and supervising test purchases was found to be deficient in the cases of Vanyan (cited above, §§ 46 and 47), and Khudobin (cited above, § 135), adopted in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In view of the continued receipt of applications raising the same issue, in 2012 the Court carried out a detailed analysis of the structural problem underlying entrapment cases and reiterated that the Russian legal system, including the Operational-Search Activities Act and other relevant instruments, did not provide for adequate and effective legal safeguards against arbitrariness (see Veselov and Others, cited above, §§ 106 and 126-27). Two years later, in Lagutin and Others (cited above, § 134), the Court stated the need to adopt general measures in order to reform this system, holding as follows:",
                "“... the failure to conduct an effective judicial review of the entrapment plea which gave rise to the finding of a violation in this case was intrinsically linked to the structural failure of the Russian legal system to provide for safeguards against abuse in the conduct of test purchases. The Court has already highlighted the structural nature of the problem, indicating that in the absence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising test purchases and operational experiments the system was in principle inadequate and prone to abuse (see paragraphs 93 and 115 above with further references). This situation in principle calls for the adoption of general measures by the respondent State, which remains, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ...”"

                "111. Furthermore, addressing the issue of entrapment in the context of “operational experiments”, a technique commonly used to expose bribe ‑ taking, the Court found the same structural flaw as the one affecting test purchases (see Nosko and Nefedov, cited above):",
                "“73. The Court reiterates that even though Russian law expressly prohibits entrapment, it nevertheless lacks adequate mechanisms of control and supervision and leaves undercover operations at the sole discretion of officers executing them, as happened in the two cases examined above. While the Court has recognised that judicial supervision would be an adequate safeguard for undercover operations, it notes that in order to exercise judicial control in practice the courts need access to sufficient factual material clarifying the circumstances leading to the conduct of an undercover operation. The Court is mindful of the burden placed on Russian courts to examine pleas of entrapment on the basis of the limited evidence provided to them at the discretion of the bodies that carry out undercover operations. However, it continues to stress that in the fight against drug trafficking, corruption and other criminal offences, considerations of procedural economy and efficiency cannot be allowed to stand in the way of an individual ’ s fundamental right to a fair trial, especially in the light of the successful efforts made by other European countries in this area (see paragraph 35 above and Veselov, cited above, §§ 50-63).",
                "74. The Court has found above that the superficial preliminary investigation combined with the deficiencies in the procedure for authorising the undercover operations in both cases left the applicants unprotected against arbitrary police action and undermined the fairness of the criminal proceedings against them. The domestic courts, for their part, failed to adequately examine the applicants ’ plea of entrapment and in particular to review the reasons for the test purchase and the conduct of the police and their informants vis-à-vis the applicants.”"

            [
                "113. In the present cases the Court has found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, linking it to the structural inadequacy of the regulatory framework, which failed to provide effective legal safeguards against abuse (see paragraph 104 above). Furthermore, the Court has by December 2020 adopted twenty judgments concerning a total of 121 similar individual applications. It observes that the facts of many of those cases occurred after the adoption of the general measures referred to by the respondent Government (see paragraphs 79 - 85 above). Several test purchases examined in those cases took place from 2015 to 2017, and the relevant domestic judgments were as recent as 2017 to 2019 (see Bokov and Others v. Russia [Committee], nos. 7779/17 and 5 others, 26 March 2020; Livadniy and Others v. Russia [Committee], nos. 12233/10 and 15 others, 26 March 2020; and Medvedev and Others v.

                "114. This problem has multifaceted repercussions beyond compromising a fair hearing. Although the number of entrapments is not counted, the scope of the problem can be inferred from the fact that in 2019, 13.1% of all convicts in Russia were imprisoned for drug-related criminal offences [1]. Despite a steady reduction of this category of offences in the overall number of criminal convictions (by about a third since 2015), this represents a significant number of 78,400 persons in one year, the majority of whom received custodial sentences. This continues to have a significant negative influence on several other human rights problems in Russia, for example the overcrowding of remand prisons leading to violations of Article 3 of the Convention on account of poor conditions of detention and transfer (see, among other examples, Idalov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 41858/08, §§ 109 and 112, 13 December 2016, and Rodionov v. Russia, no. 9106/09, §§ 99, 103 and 107, 11 December 2018 )."

In view of the above, the Court, while noting the efforts made so far by the Russian authorities, in particular the Supreme Court, to improve the examination of entrapment pleas at domestic level, and reiterating that the choice of instruments remains fully at the discretion of the respondent Government, considers it appropriate to indicate under Article 46 that a further reform of the existing regulatory framework is required."

                "116. The Court has pointed out that the crux of the problem is the absence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising undercover operations, notably test purchases and operational experiments, which eventually undermines the effective examination of entrapment pleas by the trial courts. Under the Court ’ s case-law, the authorisation of test purchases and similar covert operations must be given by a body separate from the body carrying out the operation. The role of the authorising independent body is to verify the existence of good reasons for the planned operation, which must be justified by concrete and detailed submissions of the requesting body. The same body must also supervise the conduct of the operation, or ensure that the file contains sufficient information for another independent body – ultimately the trial court – to conduct a meaningful review in order to exclude entrapment and other breaches of the law."

                "118. As to the authorisation of test purchases by prosecutors, the introduction of such a mechanism has indeed resulted in the resolution of similar problems in some countries and the closure of relevant cases by the Committee of Ministers (see for Romania CM/ ResDH (2013)40; Lithuania CM/ ResDH (2011)231; Latvia CM/ ResDH (2016)191; and Moldova CM/ ResDH (2018)12)). However, there is no certainty that the reforms carried out in these countries could be successfully replicated in the Russian legal system. The institutional place of the prosecutor ’ s office in a legal system and its functions vary significantly from one member State to another. For example, in Romania, prosecutors belong to the judiciary [2]. Whether or not a prosecutor is capable of securing a Convention-compliant safeguard also depends on the context in which it exercises its supervisory powers in a particular sphere (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 215, 10 January 2012, and Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, §§ 278-79, ECHR 2015)."

            [
                "119. On the other hand, the Court has emphasised the connection between the preliminary review of the reasons for carrying out undercover operations and the courts ’ subsequent capacity to examine pleas of entrapment effectively (see Veselov and Others, cited above, §§ 110-11). For this reason, it considers that judicial authorisation would enhance the effectiveness of the review at both stages: during the investigation and subsequently, during the examination of the criminal case on the merits. Moreover, the introduction of such judicial authorisation has resulted in the resolution of a similar problem, for example, in Portugal (see the Committee of Ministers ’ Resolution ResDH ( 2001)12 adopted in the case of Teixeira de Castro against Portugal on 26 February 2001). In this connection, it may be noted that for some other operational-search activities, such as home searches and telephone interceptions, judicial authorisation is already necessary under Russian law (see section 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act, quoted in Veselov and Others, cited above, § 44 ), and no structural flaw has been established by the Court in cases where searches and interceptions were ordered by courts, as opposed to cases where the courts were bypassed through caveats of the urgent procedure which was found to be deficient (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 266, and, mutatis mutandis, Kruglov and Others v. Russia, nos. 11264/04 and 15 others, § 124, 4 February 2020 ). The institutional and procedural rationalities would therefore suggest that judicial powers may be extended to also authorise undercover operations in a similar way. The domestic courts can then carry out proper review of entrapment complaints in conformity with the Convention standards set out in paragraphs 85 - 96 above."

In view of the above, the Court holds that, for the prevention of similar violations in the future, the structural defect previously identified by the Court must be addressed by the Russian authorities. It considers it appropriate to specify that the Russian legal framework pertaining to the conduct of operational-search activities must be amended so as to provide for a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorisation of undercover operations, such as test purchases and operational experiments, by a judicial body providing effective guarantees against abuse."

This lack of clarity allowed for manipulation, such as the use of agents provocateurs and the fabrication of evidence. The applicant contested the Government ’ s arguments that the 2006 and 2010 guidelines of the Supreme Court provided sufficient safeguards and stated that they had not been observed in practice, particularly not in her case. She reiterated that the order for the test purchase conducted against her had not been examined at trial, contrary to those guidelines. She contended that the measures listed in support of the Government ’ s statement that the problem had been addressed had had no practical effect. Entrapment was not being punished despite the legislative prohibition on entrapping, as it did not entail any sanctions or other negative consequences for officials and other individuals responsible for inciting criminal offences. The courts had a propensity to neglect pleas of entrapment and be complacent with the conduct of the investigating authorities.

According to the findings of the Constitutional Court on 17 July 2012 (see paragraph 49 above) and the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 48 - 49 above), the formal requirement for the order to be issued by the competent authority was a necessary condition for a test purchase to be valid under domestic law."

According to the Supreme Court ’ s guidelines, any circumstances contributing to the commission of crimes which were identified by the trial court could be the subject of a separate ruling indicating the relevant authority that had been responsible for a breach of the law and calling for measures to be taken in this regard. Furthermore, in its 2012 Review (see paragraph 48 above) the Supreme Court had referred to the principles set out in the Court ’ s case-law and imposed on the lower courts an obligation to verify allegations of entrapment following those principles.

To perform this task, they are increasingly required to make use of undercover agents, informers and covert practices, particularly in tackling organised crime and corruption (see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 49). The Court reiterates that while it accepts the use of undercover agents as a legitimate investigative technique for combating serious crimes, it requires that adequate safeguards against abuse be provided for, as the public interest cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police incitement (see Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, §§ 34-6, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑IV). The use of special investigative methods - in particular, undercover techniques - must be kept within clear limits, on account of the risk of police incitement entailed by such techniques (see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 51; see also Ciprian Vlăduț and Ioan Florin Pop v.

When examining an arguable plea of entrapment by an applicant, the Court will attempt, as a first step, to establish on the basis of the available material whether the offence would have been committed without the authorities ’ intervention, that is to say whether the investigation was “essentially passive”. In deciding whether the investigation was “essentially passive” the Court will examine the reasons underlying the covert operation, in particular, whether there were objective suspicions that the applicant had been involved in criminal activity or had been predisposed to commit a criminal offence until he was approached by the police (see Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014) and the conduct of the authorities carrying it out, specifically whether the authorities exerted such an influence on the applicant as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 55; Furcht, cited above, § 48; Morari v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 65311/09, § 31, 8 March 2016; and Matanović, cited above, § 123)."

The Court has stressed that any information relied on by the authorities must be verifiable (see Vanyan, cited above, § 49; Khudobin, cited above, § 134; and Veselov and Others, cited above, § 116). In cases where the police proceeded with the test purchase immediately after a first report incriminating the applicant and without any attempt to verify that information or to consider other means of investigating the applicant ’ s alleged criminal activity the Court found that the undercover operation had involved entrapment (see Vanyan, § 49, and Veselov and Others, §§ 108 and 121, both cited above). By contrast, where the test purchase was preceded by a number of investigative steps, most notably telephone tapping authorised by a court, which secured tangible evidence of the applicant ’ s pre-existing intent, and that evidence was then available for examination in open court, the Court concluded that there had been no entrapment (see Bannikova, cited above, § 69)."

Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment (see Matanović, cited above, § 126)."

The Court notes, however, that in two further cases where the authorities relied on the existence of information from an undisclosed source the material in the case files suggest that the test purchases were conducted by a police informant or even a police officer (nos. 29068/15 and 23896/15 respectively). In two other cases the material in the case files confirm that the individuals who acted as buyers had been arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence (no. 66152/14 and no. 30920/15), and in one other case the applicant ’ s plausible submission to the same effect remained unrebutted in the domestic proceedings (no. 76054/14).

The test purchases were ordered by simple administrative decisions of the bodies which later carried out the operations; the decisions contained very little information as to the reasons for and purposes of the planned test purchases, and the operations were not subjected to judicial review or any other independent supervision. There was no need to justify the decision and virtually no formalities to follow. That exposed the applicants to arbitrary action by the police which could undermine the fairness of the criminal proceedings against them (see Veselov and Others, cited above, §§ 126)."

Turning, secondly, to the procedural step, the Court has previously emphasised the role of the domestic courts in reviewing undercover operations, in particular in a system where the police operation takes place without a sufficient legal framework or adequate safeguards (see Lagutin and Others, cited above, § 119). Taking into account the importance of the covert operations for the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the applicants and the high risk of provocation, it was incumbent on the domestic courts to verify that the manner in which the test purchases had been ordered and conducted excluded the possibility of abuse of power, particularly entrapment. The Court observes that throughout the judicial proceedings the applicants maintained that they had been incited to commit criminal offences. Accordingly, in each case the domestic courts were under an obligation to examine the plea of entrapment, including, in particular, the reasons why the operation had been mounted, the extent of the police ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected (see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 71)."

However, the courts made only a limited assessment of the applicant ’ s plea of entrapment in each case, failing to examine the reasons for the undercover operation and the circumstances surrounding it and disregarding the applicant ’ s allegations of pressure from the police during the undercover operation. As noted above, in none of the cases in question did the investigating authorities prove, or have to prove, pre-existing intent on the part of the applicants to commit the criminal acts at the time when the source began collaboration with the police (cf. Sequeira and Eurofinacom, both cited above). In the cases where during trial certain information was not disclosed on the basis of confidentiality, the courts did not ensure that all information relevant to the examination of the entrapment be put openly before the trial court or tested in an adversarial manner, or give detailed reasons for the refusal to do so, contrary to the requirements of Article 6 (see Bannikova, §§ 64-65, and Lagutin and Others, § 121, both cited above).

In view of the continued receipt of applications raising the same issue, in 2012 the Court carried out a detailed analysis of the structural problem underlying entrapment cases and reiterated that the Russian legal system, including the Operational-Search Activities Act and other relevant instruments, did not provide for adequate and effective legal safeguards against arbitrariness (see Veselov and Others, cited above, §§ 106 and 126-27). Two years later, in Lagutin and Others (cited above, § 134), the Court stated the need to adopt general measures in order to reform this system, holding as follows:",

The Court has already highlighted the structural nature of the problem, indicating that in the absence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising test purchases and operational experiments the system was in principle inadequate and prone to abuse (see paragraphs 93 and 115 above with further references). This situation in principle calls for the adoption of general measures by the respondent State, which remains, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ...”"

The Court reiterates that even though Russian law expressly prohibits entrapment, it nevertheless lacks adequate mechanisms of control and supervision and leaves undercover operations at the sole discretion of officers executing them, as happened in the two cases examined above. While the Court has recognised that judicial supervision would be an adequate safeguard for undercover operations, it notes that in order to exercise judicial control in practice the courts need access to sufficient factual material clarifying the circumstances leading to the conduct of an undercover operation. The Court is mindful of the burden placed on Russian courts to examine pleas of entrapment on the basis of the limited evidence provided to them at the discretion of the bodies that carry out undercover operations. However, it continues to stress that in the fight against drug trafficking, corruption and other criminal offences, considerations of procedural economy and efficiency cannot be allowed to stand in the way of an individual ’ s fundamental right to a fair trial, especially in the light of the successful efforts made by other European countries in this area (see paragraph 35 above and Veselov, cited above, §§ 50-63).",

It observes that the facts of many of those cases occurred after the adoption of the general measures referred to by the respondent Government (see paragraphs 79 - 85 above). Several test purchases examined in those cases took place from 2015 to 2017, and the relevant domestic judgments were as recent as 2017 to 2019 (see Bokov and Others v.

Despite a steady reduction of this category of offences in the overall number of criminal convictions (by about a third since 2015), this represents a significant number of 78,400 persons in one year, the majority of whom received custodial sentences. This continues to have a significant negative influence on several other human rights problems in Russia, for example the overcrowding of remand prisons leading to violations of Article 3 of the Convention on account of poor conditions of detention and transfer (see, among other examples, Idalov v.

The Court has pointed out that the crux of the problem is the absence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising undercover operations, notably test purchases and operational experiments, which eventually undermines the effective examination of entrapment pleas by the trial courts. Under the Court ’ s case-law, the authorisation of test purchases and similar covert operations must be given by a body separate from the body carrying out the operation. The role of the authorising independent body is to verify the existence of good reasons for the planned operation, which must be justified by concrete and detailed submissions of the requesting body. The same body must also supervise the conduct of the operation, or ensure that the file contains sufficient information for another independent body – ultimately the trial court – to conduct a meaningful review in order to exclude entrapment and other breaches of the law."

However, there is no certainty that the reforms carried out in these countries could be successfully replicated in the Russian legal system. The institutional place of the prosecutor ’ s office in a legal system and its functions vary significantly from one member State to another. For example, in Romania, prosecutors belong to the judiciary [2]. Whether or not a prosecutor is capable of securing a Convention-compliant safeguard also depends on the context in which it exercises its supervisory powers in a particular sphere (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 215, 10 January 2012, and Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, §§ 278-79, ECHR 2015)."

On the other hand, the Court has emphasised the connection between the preliminary review of the reasons for carrying out undercover operations and the courts ’ subsequent capacity to examine pleas of entrapment effectively (see Veselov and Others, cited above, §§ 110-11). For this reason, it considers that judicial authorisation would enhance the effectiveness of the review at both stages: during the investigation and subsequently, during the examination of the criminal case on the merits. Moreover, the introduction of such judicial authorisation has resulted in the resolution of a similar problem, for example, in Portugal (see the Committee of Ministers ’ Resolution ResDH ( 2001)12 adopted in the case of Teixeira de Castro against Portugal on 26 February 2001). In this connection, it may be noted that for some other operational-search activities, such as home searches and telephone interceptions, judicial authorisation is already necessary under Russian law (see section 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act, quoted in Veselov and Others, cited above, § 44 ), and no structural flaw has been established by the Court in cases where searches and interceptions were ordered by courts, as opposed to cases where the courts were bypassed through caveats of the urgent procedure which was found to be deficient (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 266, and, mutatis mutandis, Kruglov and Others v. Russia, nos. 11264/04 and 15 others, § 124, 4 February 2020 ). The institutional and procedural rationalities would therefore suggest that judicial powers may be extended to also authorise undercover operations in a similar way.

In this connection, it has already considered that in the light of the various factual elements and their close temporal and substantive connection, taken as a whole, the authorities associated with the applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention did not appear to be primarily interested in the investigation of his suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed in 2014 (see paragraphs 426-433 above). In the Court’s view, the ultimate aim of the judicial authorities was to deprive the applicant of his liberty notwithstanding the decision by the Ankara Assize Court ordering his release (see paragraph 93 above).The Government argued that the offences for which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention on 20 September 2019 (summarised at paragraphs 116-117 above) were different from those forming the subject matter of the present application because the latter concerned not only the incidents which had taken place from 6 to 8 October 2014, but also included “acts and incidents” indicated in several other investigation reports (see paragraph 415 above). Thus, according to the Government themselves, the detention order of 20 September 2019 also related to the incidents occurring between 6 and 8 October 2014, although it was framed in narrower terms than the charges leading to the applicant’s initial detention.

Our people have the power to resist against pressure and massacre policies everywhere. We have the power to protect ourselves against any attack. We will show that we are not despairing; we will resist together; we will achieve salvation without forgetting our motherland and history and by defending our rights.’",

[Because] these people are absolutely certain that they will triumph from the very first day. They are the defenders of an honourable, noble and dignified cause. We will not let cruelty and fascism win any more; this resistance will triumph. Those who try to downplay it by calling it [resistance of] ditches and holes should look back at history. There are tens of millions of heroes and brave people resisting against this coup. You are waging a war against the people. The people are resisting and will resist everywhere. Next week, on 26 and 27 December, we will attend the extraordinary meeting of the Democratic Society Congress in Diyarbakır. We will have intensive discussions and take important decisions concerning the processes of self-governance and autonomy and their operation in the political arena. We will implement them all.’",

                "On 26 December 2015 the suspect made the [following] statements to the DTK: ‘The barricades and trenches are not the result of the Kurdish people’s desire for self-governance; they were put up because the people who made plans for a massacre in Ankara began implementing those plans. What trench, what barricade? We can’t play down the question. The resistance in the trenches and barricades [is driven by the same motive as] the resistance against fascism and massacres: the right to an honourable life. If one day someone refuses to accept this and discuss it and says he will lock up and bring to their knees anyone who thinks in this way ... ‘Oh, they have put up barricades, but that’s not much – what else can they do?’ They criticise us because that’s what people say. If we, the politicians, NGOs, workers’ organisations, women’s organisations, youth organisations, local authorities, can support self-governance, if we can achieve it step by step, we will solve this historic problem. This resistance will lead to victory. My thanks go to all our friends [, who are not letting us down], who are resisting, who are not crumbling, [and] all our comrades who, despite everything, are remaining by the people’s side during this time. Once again, I repeat my promise of loyalty and affection towards our friends, their families and the martyrs from 7 to 70 who have put their lives at risk.’",
                "On 26 March 2016, in the theatre hall at Yenişehir Municipality Building, the suspect gave a speech [in which he stated]: ‘Not claiming a corpse is dishonourable; leaving a corpse on the ground is dishonourable. We are looking at [what is happening] with shame; we are truly ashamed. [They are saying:] ‘Oh, you went to [express] your condolences’, ‘no, it was a member of parliament [from your party] who went’, ‘no, the other one went...’. Can there be fifteen million terrorists in a country? If you [accuse] everyone of terrorism, in particular if you [accuse] the Kurds, who are claiming [their] rights and freedoms, [and] if you say you are going to take the necessary action, [this] fifteen-million-strong people will resist against your fascist practices by all available means. [Against this background], resistance becomes legitimate. Otherwise, war is not legitimate, there is no legitimacy [in] war. Resistance is legitimate. The people will be obliged to pay a higher price, our young people will be obliged to pay a higher price [and] we, the politicians, can only look at what is happening with sorrow when our dearest [friends] are murdered before our eyes. Against this background, I trust that the Democratic Society Congress will revive the enthusiasm [from] the time of its creation.’",

                "it has been found that there is a suspicion, based on concrete evidence, that the suspect committed the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation.",

(It should be reiterated that, in accordance with Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention, a person may be detained only in the context of criminal proceedings, for the purpose of bringing him or her before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence (see Jėčius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 50, ECHR 2000-IX; Włoch v. Poland, no. 27785/95, §108, ECHR 2000-XI; and Poyraz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 21235/11, § 53, 17 February 2015). The ‘reasonableness’ of the suspicion on which a detention order must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as reasonable will, however, depend on all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, § 32, Series A no. 182; O’Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, § 34, ECHR 2001-X; Korkmaz and Others v. Turkey, no. 35979/97, § 24, 21 March 2006; Süleyman Erdem v. Turkey, no. 49574/99, § 37, 19 September 2006; and Çiçek v. Turkey (dec.), no. 72774/10, § 62, 3 March 2015).",
                "Having regard to the nature of the suspect’s alleged offence of forming and leading an armed terrorist organisation, since it is among those listed in Article 100 § 3 (a) (11) of the CCP (no. 5271), and to the above-mentioned indications of the existence of concrete evidence giving rise to a strong suspicion, there is a strong suspicion [ sic ] of the commission of the offence in question, and therefore a ground for detention in accordance with Article 100 § 3 (a) (11) of the CCP.",
                "As pointed out in the Constitutional Court’s decisions of 27 October 2011 (nos. E. 2010/71 and K. 2011/143) and 27 December 2012 (nos. E. 2012/35 and 2012/203), the proportionality principle comprises the principles of ‘appropriateness’, ‘necessity’ and ‘proportionality’ [ sic ]. In view of the nature of the suspect’s alleged offence, the lower and upper limit of the prison sentence prescribed by law, the importance of the case and the anticipated penalty and security measure, the pre-trial detention [of the suspect] is proportionate to the aim pursued. Certain grounds dictate that [the suspect] must be detained; consequently, [while there are risks linked to the suspects’ detention,] it has nevertheless been deemed necessary to impose the measure of detention. The aim cannot be achieved by applying judicial supervision measures; following an assessment of the provisions on judicial supervision measures, [they are] deemed insufficient. For these reasons, the detention order will satisfy the proportionality principle set forth in Article 13 of the Constitution and Article 100 § 1 of the CCP (no. 5271). In view of all the above considerations, judicial supervision measures are insufficient. There is concrete evidence giving rise to a strong suspicion against the suspects. There is a ground for detention and [that measure] is proportionate. There are grounds for detention in the light of Article 19 of the Constitution, Article 5 of the [Convention] and Article 100 of the CCP (no. 5271). Furthermore, the deprivation of liberty is lawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 of the [Convention and] is compatible with the principle of the rule of law enshrined in the provisions of the [Convention] and Article 100 of the CCP.

                "(i) In a speech given in the BDP offices in Batman on 27 October 2012, the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of the PKK terrorist organisation by urging people to close their shops and not to send their children to school as a protest aimed at securing the release of the PKK leader.",
                "(ii) On 13 November 2012 two demonstrations had been held in Nusaybin and Kızıltepe in protest against the conditions of the PKK leader’s detention, and the applicant had made the following comments in Kızıltepe:",
                "“They said you couldn’t put up the poster of Öcalan. Those who said it ... Let me speak clearly. We are going to put up a sculpture of President Apo. The Kurdish people have now risen up. With their leader, their party, their elected representatives, their children, their young and old, they are one of the greatest peoples of the Middle East.” (“ Demişler ki Öcalan posteri asamazsınız. Onu diyenlere açıkça sesleniyorum... Biz başkan Apo’nun heykelini dikeceğiz heykelini. Kürt halkı artık ayağa kalkmış bir halktır. Önderiyle, partisiyle, seçilmişiyle, çocuğuyla, genciyle, yaşlısıyla Ortadoğu’nun en büyük halklarından biridir. ”) According to the bill of indictment, these comments amounted to propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation.",
                "(iii) In a speech he had given in the BDP offices in Diyarbakır on 21 April 2013, the applicant had stated the following: “The Kurdish movement used to see the war as a legitimate war of self-defence. Nowadays, if you have enough experience to resist [and] prevail using non-violent methods, it is not morally [and] politically right to use weapons. Today, those who criticise us also say that the Kurdish people would not exist, at least in Turkish Kurdistan, without the PKK movement. You could not speak of the existence of Kurds in Turkish Kurdistan. Without the coup in 1984 [the year of the first PKK attacks], without the guerrillas, no one today could speak of the existence of the Kurdish people; the Kurds had no other choice. At the time of the initial resistance in Şemdinli [and] Eruh [the first terrorist attacks by the PKK, carried out in the Şemdinli district in Hakkari and the Eruh district in Siirt on 15 August 1984], no one was aware of what was happening but the resistance has today created [the] reality of the [Kurdish] people. We have gained our identity.” (“Kürt hareketi savaşı meşru müdafaa savaşı olarak ele aldı. Şimdi eğer elinizde silah dışında yöntemlerle güçle, mekanizmayla direnebilecek, başarabilecek yeteri kadar birikim varsa siz buna rağmen silahı kullanırsınız birincisi bu ahlaki olmaz ikincisi de siyasi olarak da doğru bir tercih olmaz. Kürt halkı evet bugün biz sadece söylemiyoruz, bizi eleştirenler de söylüyordu, PKK hareketi olmasaydı bugün Kürt halkı diye bir şey Türkiye Kürdistan’ı için en azından olmayacaktı. Türkiye Kürdistanı’nda Kürtlerin varlığından söz edilmeyecekti. 1984 hamlesi olmasaydı, gerilla savaşı olmasıydı, kimse bugün Kürt halkının varlığından söz edemezdi, çünkü Kürtlerin başka çaresi yoktu. ...

Furthermore, with regard to the “trench events”, the Constitutional Court held that, bearing in mind the statements made by the applicant, the places where he had made them and his position as co-chair of the HDP, his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not devoid of justification. In the same vein, having regard to the content of the two speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013 (see paragraph 79 above), it held that there was undeniably an indication that an offence had been committed. Lastly, taking into account the content of the conversations among presumed senior officials of the PKK and between them and the applicant (see paragraph 79 above), it found that it had been legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of a terrorist organisation.

The Constitutional Court added that the severity of the potential sentence was a factor to consider when assessing the risk of absconding. It added that the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities and had stated that no member of parliament from his party would give evidence voluntarily.

In that context, the applicant had alleged that his detention had prevented him from carrying out political activities. Referring to several Constitutional Court judgments concerning the pre-trial detention of members of parliament, he had argued that his detention was disproportionate to the aim pursued, in view of his status as a member of parliament. In that connection, the Constitutional Court stated firstly that, contrary to what the applicant had maintained, it had never given a judgment in which it had found that the pre-trial detention of a member of parliament whose immunity had been lifted amounted in itself to a breach of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court further noted that as the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention a long time after the alleged offences had been committed, it had to examine whether or not his pre-trial detention could have been regarded as necessary. In that context, it pointed out that, in accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution, the applicant could not have been placed in pre-trial detention while he enjoyed parliamentary immunity. It observed that the investigation reports concerning him had been sent to the competent public prosecutors after the entry into force of the constitutional amendment introducing an exception to parliamentary immunity, and that he had been placed in pre ‑ trial detention some five months afterwards. It was therefore clear from the evidence in the case file that the investigating authorities had not remained inactive during that period. The Constitutional Court added that it was unable to conclude that the applicant’s pre-trial detention had been disproportionate and arbitrary, notably in view of the severity of the sentence prescribed for the offences in question. For those reasons, it declared this part of the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded."

In his dissenting opinion, Mr Engin Yıldırım, the judge in the minority, observed, like the majority, taking into account the evidence in the file, that there was a strong indication that the applicant had committed an offence; however, referring to the principles deriving from the Court’s case-law, in particular Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova ([GC], no. 23755/07, 5 July 2016), he submitted that the applicant’s detention was not proportionate, in so far as it had not been shown that there were relevant and sufficient reasons to justify it. In his opinion, the reasons why the application of an alternative measure to detention would have been insufficient had not been explained by the judicial authorities. Turning to the risk of absconding, he noted firstly that two main reasons had been put forward to substantiate that risk, namely the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences in question and the fact that the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities. In the dissenting judge’s view, however, the severity of a sentence could not per se justify a person’s pre-trial detention. Similarly, it could not be concluded that the applicant’s refusal to appear before the investigating authorities could form a basis for establishing such a risk, since the applicant had continued to carry out his political activities without demonstrating the slightest intention of absconding. The dissenting judge added that between the entry into force of the amendment to the Constitution lifting the applicant’s parliamentary immunity and the date of his initial pre-trial detention, the applicant had travelled abroad more than ten times and had never attempted to flee. For these reasons, he was of the view that there had been a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution in the applicant’s case. Noting in addition that the applicant was a member of parliament and co-chair of a political party that had obtained more than five million votes, the dissenting judge considered that his pre-trial detention without relevant and sufficient reasons also amounted to a breach of the right to be elected and to carry out political activities as safeguarded by Article 67 of the Constitution.",

In a judgment delivered on 4 December 2013 (no. 2012/1272) concerning the detention of a member of parliament, the Constitutional Court ruled on a complaint relating to the right to be elected in conjunction with a complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention. The case concerned the pre-trial detention of Mr Balbay, who had been elected as a member of the National Assembly following the parliamentary elections held on 12 June 2011. On 5 August 2013, while his application was still pending before the Constitutional Court, Mr Balbay had been sentenced to sixteen years’ imprisonment. In its judgment, the Constitutional Court found not only a violation of the right to liberty, but also a violation of the right to be elected on account of the excessive duration of Mr Balbay’s pre-trial detention following his election (more than two years and one month, out of a total duration of four years and five months). The Constitutional Court held as follows:",

While the applicant was in pre-trial detention, he was elected as a member of parliament in the parliamentary elections held on 12 June 2011. In that respect, neither the applicant’s prosecution nor his pre-trial detention constituted an obstacle to his election as a member of parliament ... Since he was not provisionally released after his election, the applicant was unable to take the oath or to sit in Parliament. It is beyond doubt that the detention in question, which made it impossible to perform his parliamentary duties, constituted an interference with [the applicant’s] right to be elected, because [the measure in issue] hindered all political activity and [the performance of his duties] as a member of parliament.",
                "133. ... [T]he applications for provisional release submitted by the applicant after his election were dismissed by the competent courts. [It should be reiterated that in the examination of the compatibility of the pre-trial detention with Article 19 of the Constitution, an equivalent provision to Article 5 of the Convention], it was concluded that the dismissal of the applications for provisional release submitted by the applicant after his election did not strike a fair balance between his right to be elected and the interest of society in the continued pre-trial detention of a person charged with a criminal offence. Having been unreasonably kept in pre-trial detention, the applicant was unable to take part in legislative activities. In view of the duration of the applicant’s pre-trial detention after his election, it cannot be concluded that this severe interference with the right to carry out political activities was proportionate and compatible with the requirements of a democratic society.”",

                "159. In October 2012 the Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy of the European Parliament published a study on parliamentary immunity, the relevant parts of which read:",
                "The scope of non-liability normally covers protection against all kinds of public penalties for acts committed in the performance of members’ duties or, more popularly formulated, deals with members’ freedom of speech. In general, parliamentarians are not liable in civil or criminal terms for the acts encompassed within this form of immunity. Non-liability is also referred to as ‘substantive immunity’, ‘absolute immunity’, or ‘parliamentary immunity’.",
                "With regard to the acts covered by non-liability, these include votes cast and opinions expressed. ‘Substantive immunity extends to all the forms which parliamentary activity may take, whether in writing parliamentary documents, or in speeches and votes in all their forms, in parliamentary assemblies and committees.’",
                "The scope of the protection afforded as regards ‘opinions’ stated is one of the most controversial aspects of non-liability. The majority of constitutional texts make use of the concept of opinions expressed ‘in the exercise of duties’. This permits a somewhat broad interpretation, so that it makes the protection applicable to certain statements made outside Parliament. ...",
                "Unlike inviolability, non-liability has an absolute quality, in that the protection afforded is maintained even after the parliamentarian’s mandate has come to an end.",
                "In general, this form of immunity is such that, unless parliament gives its authorisation, members may not be arrested or prosecuted for acts not carried out as part of their parliamentary functions.",
                "The scope of inviolability varies according to the degree of protection afforded to parliamentarians. It may thus be the case that, unless the house concerned has given its prior authorisation, parliamentarians are protected only from arrest or, in addition, from enforcement of particular meas ­ ures such as searches or, more widely still, from a court summons or indeed any form of criminal proceedings.",
                "... [M]ost parliaments consider that, in the case of in flagrante delicto, inviolability must be waived. The term in flagrante delicto refers to cases where a person is caught in the very act of wrongdoing. Generally, it is for judges to determine whether an offence falls under the heading of in flagrante delicto. Still, according to some constitutions, in order to remove immunity without delay, it is not sufficient that in flagrante delicto be verified, the offence in question must also be a serious one.",
                "As regards the duration of the inviolability, it can be seen that, while in some parliaments it has effect throughout the duration of the parliamentary term, in others it refers only to the periods during which parliament is in session.",
                "Unlike non-liability, inviolability is effective only during the period of the parliamentary mandate and ceases to have effect after this has expired. Legal action is thus only postponed and not permanently prevented.",

In its judgment E. 2006/10-253 K. 2007/80 of 3 April 2007, the General Criminal Board of the Court of Cassation listed the main criteria that a criminal organisation – for the purposes of Article 220 of the [Criminal] Code – should display. The group has to have at least three members; there should be a tight or loose hierarchical connection between the members of the group and an ‘abstract link’ between the members is not sufficient; the members should have a common intention to commit crimes (even though no crime has yet been committed); the group has to present continuity in time; and the structure of the group, the number of its members, tools and equipment at the disposal of the group should be sufficient/appropriate for the commission of the envisaged crimes.",
                "100. There is a rich case-law of the Court of Cassation in which the high court developed the criterion of ‘membership’ in an armed organisation. The Court of Cassation examined different acts of the suspect concerned, taking account of their ‘continuity, diversity and intensity’ in order to see whether those acts prove that the suspect has any ‘organic relationship’ with the organisation or whether his or her acts may be considered as committed knowingly and wilfully within the ‘hierarchical structure’ of the organisation. In case E. 2010/2839, K. 2012/1406 of 6 February 2012, the suspects who were constantly providing shelter to new candidates willing to become members of a terrorist organisation, providing them with falsified identity cards and introducing them to the organisation and looking for other new members for the organisation, were convicted for being members of an armed organisation. Acquiring a code name (within the organisation) in order to hide his/her real identity and hiding in his/her apartment a bomb delivered by the members of a terrorist organisation; giving courses on the aims and structure of the organisation to the new members, contacting again the organisation after having been released from prison and trying to collect money for the organisation and to find new members, delivering his/her ‘CV report’ to the organisation in order to become its member or driving new comers willing to become members of the organisation, to the camping place of the organisation, collecting money for the organisation under the guise of collecting tax for the organisation or organising the medical treatment of the new members before they were sent to the camping place of the organisation, etc. were all considered by the Court of Cassation as proving the membership of the defendant to an armed organisation under Article 314 of the [Criminal] Code, as the continuity, diversity and intensity of the acts attributed to the defendants showed that they were acting knowingly and willingly within the hierarchical structure of the armed organisation.",
                "102. According to non-governmental sources, in the application of Article 314, the domestic courts, in many cases, decide on the membership of a person in an armed organisation on the basis of very weak evidence, which would raise questions as to the ‘foreseeability’ of the application of Article 314. Similarly, Freedom House in its 2015 Report on Freedom of Press in Turkey noted that ‘ Article 314 of the [Criminal] Code, with its broad definition of ... membership in an armed organization, continued to be invoked against journalists, especially Kurds and those associated with the political left ’. Also, Amnesty International, in its 2013 Report on Turkey, considered that conduct, which is not in itself criminal, as for instance an activity related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, is considered as evidence of membership of the defendants in an armed organisation. The reason for this approach, according to the Report, is that the prosecution services perceive those activities as having the same overall objective as a terrorist group and as a result, ‘ individuals have been prosecuted for membership of terrorist organisation on charges relating solely to their engagement in peaceful and, in themselves, lawful pro-Kurdish activities ’. The examples of concrete cases provided by Amnesty International in which the evidence was considered to link the defendants to a terrorist organisation included, attendance at six different demonstrations allegedly organised by a terrorist organisation and a speech made at one of those demonstrations, or, in another case, the participation of the defendant in the ‘Political Academy’ organised by the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP – a recognised pro-Kurdish political party) and his diverse activities in the framework of this Academy.",
                "106. In conclusion, the Venice Commission recommends, first, that the established criteria in the case law of the Court of Cassation that acts attributed to a defendant should show ‘in their continuity, diversity and intensity’, his/her ‘organic relationship’ to an organisation or they should prove that he/she acted knowingly and willingly within the ‘hierarchical structure’ of the organisation, should be applied strictly. The loose application of these criteria may give rise to issues concerning in particular the principle of legality within the meaning of Article 7 ECHR.",
                "107. Second, the expression of an opinion in its different forms should not be the only evidence before the domestic courts to decide on the membership of the defendant in an armed organisation. Where the only evidence consists of forms of expression, the conviction for being a member of an armed organisation, would constitute an interference with the right of the defendants to freedom of expression, and that the necessity of this interference on the basis of the criteria as set forth in the case-law of the ECtHR, in particular the criteria of ‘incitement to violence’, should be examined in the concrete circumstances of each case.",
                "123. The Venice Commission ... concludes that the progress made is clearly insufficient. All articles subject to the present opinion provide for excessive sanctions and have been applied too widely, penalising conduct protected under the ECHR, in particular its Article 10 and the related case-law as well as conduct protected under Article 19 ICCPR.",
                "124. All four articles have to be applied in a radically different manner to bring their application fully in line with Article 10 ECHR and Article 19 ICCPR. The Commission underlines that prosecution of individuals and convictions in particular by lower courts, which have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression, must cease. This is not sufficient if individuals are in some cases finally acquitted by the Court of Cassation after having been subject of criminal prosecution for several years. Moreover, the Commission underlines the importance of States’ positive obligation to create a favourable environment where different and alternative ideas can flourish.",
                "128. With respect to Article 314 (Membership [of] an armed organisation), the established criterion in the case law of the Court of Cassation that acts attributed to a defendant should show ‘in their continuity, diversity and intensity’ his/her ‘organic relationship’ to an armed organisation or whether his/her acts may be considered as committed knowingly and wilfully within the ‘hierarchical structure’ of the organisation, should have a strict application. ...”",

The relevant passages of this opinion read as follows:",

The General Preamble to the Amendment explains that its purpose is to address public indignation about ‘ statements of certain deputies constituting emotional and moral support to terrorism, the de facto support and assistance of certain deputies to terrorists and the calls of violence of certain deputies ’. Statements by Members of Parliament, which may be interpreted as supporting terrorism, may indeed be punishable under criminal law but such statements will normally have a political character and therefore the question whether they should be covered by parliamentary non-liability is particularly relevant.",

The constitutional amendment of 12 April 2016 was an ad hoc, ‘one shot’ ad homines measure directed against 139 individual deputies for cases that were already pending before the Assembly. Acting as the constituent power, the Grand National Assembly maintained the regime of immunity as established in Articles 83 and 85 of the Constitution for the future but derogated from this regime for specific cases concerning identifiable individuals while using general language. This is a misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure.",
                "81. The argument that dealing one by one with the cases against these deputies would have taken too long and would have unduly burdened the agenda of the Grand National Assembly is not convincing. Instead of simplifying the procedure of lifting immunity, the complex system was maintained but it was derogated for 139 deputies. The heavy workload of the Grand National Assembly does not justify singling out the cases relating to these deputies from all other cases brought before it before and after the adoption of the Amendment. This violates the principle of equality. In the opinion of the Commission, the system of parliamentary immunity in Turkey should not be weakened, but reinforced, in particular in order to ensure the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament.",

                "“21. First, the debates took place in the absence of a significant number of deputies from the opposition. Indeed, following a constitutional amendment enacted on 20 May 2016, published in the Official [Gazette] on 8 June 2016 and entered into force the same day, the parliamentary immunity of several MPs was lifted. On 4 November 2016, the President of the second-largest opposition party HDP (Selahattin Demirtaş) and 8 other HDP MPs were taken into detention on remand. There are currently 13 members of HDP who are still in detention, despite the Venice Commission’s recommendation to restore parliamentary immunity in Turkey.",
                "119. The Commission finds that the proposed composition of the CJP [Council of Judges and Prosecutors] is extremely problematic. Almost half of its members (4+2=6 out of 13) will be appointed by the President. It is important to stress once again in this respect that the President will no more be a pouvoir neutre, but will be engaged in party politics: his choice of the members of the CJP will not have to be politically neutral. The remaining 7 members would be appointed by the Grand National Assembly. If the party of the President has a three-fifths majority in the Assembly, it will be able to fill all positions in the Council. If it has, as is almost guaranteed under the system of simultaneous elections, at least two-fifths of the seats, it will be able to obtain several seats, forming a majority together with the presidential appointees. That would place the independence of the judiciary in serious jeopardy, because the CJP is the main self-governing body overseeing appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplining and dismissal of judges and public prosecutors. Getting control over this body thus means getting control over judges and public prosecutors, especially in a country where the dismissal of judges has become frequent and where transfers of judges are a common practice. In this context it seems significant that the draft amendments provide for elections to the CJP within 30 days following the entry into force of the amendments and that the political forces supporting the amendments control more than three-fifths of the seats in the TGNA, enabling them to fill all seats in the CJP.",

The Ministry of Justice provided statistics showing that the rate of detained persons as compared to the number of convicted persons was reduced from 50 per cent to 14 per cent between 2007 and 2014, before the establishment of the peace judges. However, this rate remained stable until the coup. These statistics thus show that the establishment of peace judgeships and the system of horizontal appeals between peace judgeships of the same level has not succeeded in reducing the problem of the length of pre-trial detention.",
                "78. ... [D]etentions ordered by peace judgeships are problematic due to the system of horizontal appeals. Furthermore, for persons who remain under detention in the investigation phase and who have been detained by peace judgeships on the basis of insufficiently reasoned decisions ... [, the p]rosecution should request their release as soon as possible.",
                "94. ... [T]he way of establishment of the peace judgeships and the system of functioning examined above are conducive to insufficient motivation of their decisions.

The fact that the decisions of peace judgeships can be appealed to the Constitutional Court does not remedy this structural problem.",

                "59. While critical journalists are the most obvious victims of this situation ..., many other sectors and groups were also directly targeted. A particularly disturbing manifestation of this situation is the lifting of the immunities of parliamentarians. In a move that the Venice Commission described as an ad hoc, ‘one shot’ and ‘ ad homines ’ measure, as well as a misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure, the majority in the Turkish Parliament lifted the immunities of 139 of its members who were subject to pending prosecution requests submitted to the Parliament. One of the most worrying aspects of this measure was the fact that the majority of impugned acts concerned statements made by these MPs, for example for insulting the President or other public officials, terrorist propaganda or incitement to hatred. The preamble of the constitutional amendment itself stated that its purpose was to address public indignation about, inter alia, ‘statements of certain deputies constituting emotional and moral support to terrorism’. As the Venice Commission highlighted, nearly all MPs of a particular opposition party, the HDP, were concerned by the measure. As a result of this measure, prosecutions are on-going against a large number of opposition MPs. Several members of HDP, including its co-Chairs, were arrested in November 2016. The Turkish authorities have stated that the reason of the arrests was the refusal of the MPs to comply with the order to personally appear before the prosecutor. However, even after having forcibly been made to give evidence, 11 MPs are still in prison and cannot carry out their parliamentary mandate at a crucial juncture.",
                "60. The ECtHR made it very clear that ‘[w]hile freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people. He represents his electorate, draws attention to their preoccupations and defends their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament ... call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court.’ The Commissioner also recalls the ECtHR’s judgment concerning DTP, a precursor party of the HDP, which was unduly closed, mainly for statements of its members which were protected under Article 10. The Commissioner notes, in particular, that these statements were very similar to the statements which were used as justification for the lifting of the immunities in the present case.",
                "61. The Commissioner draws the authorities’ attention particularly to the conclusion of the Court that the mere fact that there are parallels between the principles defended by the DTP and those of the PKK did not suffice to conclude that the party approved of the use of force in order to implement its policies. If a political group was considered to be supporting terrorism, merely by advocating those principles, that would reduce the possibility of dealing with relate[d] issues in the context of a democratic debate and would allow armed movements to monopolise support for the principles in question. In the current climate, the Commissioner considers that the lifting of the immunities of MPs and their subsequent arrest and detention not only disenfranchised millions of voters, but sent an extremely dangerous and chilling message to the entire Turkish population, and significantly reduced the scope of democratic debate, including on human rights.”",

In addition to being capable of establishing liability on the State’s part (see Peraldi v. France (dec.), no. 2096/05, 7 April 2009) and bringing the alleged violation to an end by offering appropriate redress (see Mikolenko v.

The Commission also found that Article 27 § 1 (b) of the Convention (equivalent to the present-day Article 35 § 2 (b)) referred to intergovernmental institutions and procedures. Therefore, the Commission clarified that the mechanisms set up by non-governmental organisations were clearly excluded from the scope of Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention. That said, however, even if a given mechanism has not been set up by a non-governmental organisation, that does not automatically mean that it qualifies as “another procedure of international investigation or settlement”. After all, the question the Court is called upon to answer in such situations is whether that mechanism provides for “judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention” in the light, inter alia, of the criteria set forth in Greek Federation of Bank Employee Unions (cited above) and the institutional and procedural safeguards it must afford."

As far as procedural safeguards are concerned, the Court considers that a judicial or quasi-judicial body must offer an adversarial procedure enabling each party to be informed of and to reply to the other party’s submissions. The parties must also be informed of the measures and decisions taken. A body of this kind must also respect the parties’ right to participate in the proceedings, for example by submitting observations. In addition, the body must respond to individual applications by making its decisions public and stating reasons for them (compare Mikolenko, cited above, and Celniku v. Greece, no. 21449/04, § 40, 5 July 2007). Furthermore, it must be able to determine the State’s responsibility under the legal instrument on which its examination is based and to afford legal redress capable of putting an end to the alleged violation (compare Mikolenko, cited above, and Karoussiotis v.

This is especially relevant in the context of analysing the similarities between such a mechanism and the Court as it is the Court’s task, by virtue of Article 32 of the Convention, to interpret and apply the provisions of the Convention and, as provided in Article 19, to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States in the Convention.

Even assuming that the status of the IPU in the above-mentioned dichotomy in Lukanov has changed since the date of that decision, the Court considers that it does not need to resolve that issue for the purposes of its examination under Article 35 § 2 (b) in the present case. Instead, the Court will focus its examination on whether the procedure before the IPU Committee is similar, in terms of its particular features and potential effects, to individual applications lodged under Article 34 of the Convention.

Its aims are to prevent possible violations, put an end to ongoing violations, and/or promote State action to offer effective redress for violations by doing “everything possible to foster a dialogue with the authorities of the countries concerned, first and foremost their parliament, in the pursuit of a satisfactory settlement”.

The voicing of political criticism in general and criticism against the State in particular should be afforded the widest possible protection in a democratic society. In that connection, a distinction should be made between political expression and statements that encouraged violence.

As stated in the explanatory memorandum on the constitutional amendment, it was brought forward because “at a time when Turkey [was] waging the strongest and most intensive campaign against terrorism in its history, certain members of parliament, whether before or after their election, [had] made speeches voicing moral support for terrorism”, which had “aroused public indignation” (see paragraph 56 above). The aim of the constitutional amendment was therefore to limit the political speech of the members of parliament in question, including the applicant. Following the amendment, the Diyarbakır public prosecutor decided to merge thirty-one criminal investigations in respect of the applicant into a single case. The applicant was then arrested, on 4 November 2016.

The Court refers to its well-established case-law to the effect that an impugned measure must have some basis in domestic law and also be compatible with the rule of law, which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble to the Convention and is inherent in all its Articles. In particular, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the discretion granted to the competent authorities to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. The law must therefore indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on them and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, §§ 228 and 230, ECHR 2015; Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82; Olsson v.

The Court’s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 72, ECHR 2008).

In the Court’s view, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable people to regulate their conduct; they must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. While certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007-IV; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, § 141; and Delfi AS, cited above, § 121). The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the application of a law should be laid down in the text of the law itself; it may be satisfied if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of domestic law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes. A law which confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with the requirement of foreseeability, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Magyar Kétfarkú Kutya Párt v.

It is not in dispute that following the constitutional amendment of 20 May 2016, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention on the basis of Articles 100 et seq. of the CCP. The question to which the parties’ arguments and differing positions relate is whether the constitutional amendment in question and the provisions of the Criminal Code on membership of and/or leading an armed terrorist organisation can in this instance be considered to satisfy the “quality of the law” requirement. The Court must therefore determine whether, in both of the above regards, the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression can be said to have been “prescribed by law”. In particular, the Court will examine whether the domestic law, as interpreted and applied in the present case, was foreseeable at the time of the speeches by the applicant that led to his prosecution."

The Government added that the applicant had praised the leader of the PKK and had called on the people to take to the streets. The applicant, for his part, submitted that he had given similar speeches during proceedings of the National Assembly and that the speeches in question were therefore protected by the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution.

However, on the contrary, the applicant argued from the start of his pre-trial detention that in the light of the first paragraph of Article 83, he could not be deprived of his liberty. Indeed, this was one of his main arguments (see, in particular, paragraph 70 above). In that context, he lodged several objections with a view to securing his release (see, in particular, paragraphs 77 and 80 above). Furthermore, on 3 April 2018 he asked the Ankara 19th Assize Court to examine the speeches he had given in the course of parliamentary proceedings and to compare their content with that of the impugned speeches. To that end, he also requested that an expert be appointed to determine whether those speeches were protected under the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution (see paragraph 91 above). However, it appears from the documents produced by the parties that no such examination was carried out. When ordering the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court quite simply observed that the constitutional amendment had had the effect of lifting the applicant’s parliamentary immunity for the offences in question. The Constitutional Court similarly observed that the constitutional amendment of 20 May 2016 had made it possible to grant the requests for the lifting of the applicant’s parliamentary immunity that had been referred to the National Assembly before the adoption of the amendment. Nevertheless, the magistrates who ordered the applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention, the prosecutors who instituted the criminal proceedings against him, the assize court judges who decided to keep him in pre-trial detention and, lastly, the Constitutional Court judges did not carry out any examination of whether the speeches in issue were protected on account of the applicant’s parliamentary non-liability.

The second paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution, in its unamended form, provides for parliamentary inviolability, shielding elected representatives from any arrest, detention or prosecution during their term of office without the consent of the National Assembly.

Furthermore, under Article 85 of the Constitution, the member of parliament concerned or another member may appeal to the Constitutional Court against a decision by the National Assembly to lift immunity, within seven days of the date of the decision.

In this connection, the Court has already held that laws which are directed against specific persons are contrary to the rule of law (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 117, 23 June 2016). After the adoption of the amendment, the National Assembly maintained the regime of immunity as established in Articles 83 and 85 of the Constitution, while at the same time making it inapplicable to certain identifiable members of parliament on the basis of general and objective wording. In this context, the Court fully subscribes to the Venice Commission’s clear finding that this was a “misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure”. In the Court’s view, bearing in mind Turkish parliamentary practice and tradition, a member of parliament could not reasonably expect that such a procedure would be introduced during his term of office, thereby undermining the freedom of expression of members of the National Assembly."

Next, taking into account a number of speeches by the applicant and the fact that he was the subject of several criminal investigations being carried out by the competent prosecuting authorities for terrorism-related offences (see paragraph 70 above), the magistrate concluded that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of membership of an armed terrorist organisation (Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code).

Accordingly, the decision given on 4 November 2016 by the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court does not give a clear indication of which offence(s) formed the basis for the applicant’s detention.

Regarding “membership of an armed organisation”, the Court of Cassation takes into account the continuity, diversity and intensity of the acts attributed to the suspects in order to determine whether those acts prove that the suspect had an “organic relationship” with the organisation or whether the acts may be considered to have been committed knowingly and willingly within the “hierarchical structure” of the organisation (see paragraph 160 above)."

Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 50, ECHR 2000-IX; Włoch v. Poland, no. 27785/95, § 108, ECHR 2000-XI; and Poyraz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 21235/11, § 53, 17 February 2015).

The Court has already found, in Fox, Campbell and Hartley (cited above, § 32), that in view of the difficulties inherent in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism-related offences, the “reasonableness” of the suspicion justifying deprivation of liberty cannot always be judged according to the same standards as are applied in dealing with conventional crime. Nevertheless, in the Court’s view the exigencies of combating terrorist crime cannot justify stretching the notion of “reasonableness” to the point where the essence of the safeguard secured by Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention is impaired (ibid., § 32). The Court’s task in the present case is therefore to ascertain whether at the time of the applicant’s initial detention there were sufficient elements to satisfy an objective observer that he could have committed the offences of which he was accused by the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 271 above). In so doing, it must assess whether the measure in question was justified on the basis of information and facts available at the relevant time which had been submitted to the scrutiny of the judicial authorities that ordered the measure."

                "324. On 4 November 2016 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor asked the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court to place the applicant in pre-trial detention for membership of an armed terrorist organisation and public incitement to commit an offence. On the same day, the applicant was brought before the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court, which ordered his pre-trial detention. In making that order, the magistrate observed firstly that the constitutional amendment had had the effect of lifting the applicant’s parliamentary immunity in relation to the offences concerned. He then observed that during the escalation of clashes between Daesh and the PYD in Syria in October 2014, the PKK leaders had issued several calls for people to take to the streets. He added that almost simultaneously, three tweets had been posted on behalf of the HDP central executive board, of which the applicant was a member and co-chair, likewise urging people to go out into the streets. The magistrate further noted that during the events of 6 to 8 October 2014, PKK supporters had committed a number of offences, and in particular had caused the death of fifty people, injuries to 678 others and damage to 1,113 buildings. In the magistrate’s view, the tweets posted on the HDP Twitter account established a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of public incitement to commit an offence, in discharging his duties within the party in question. The magistrate further observed that the applicant had given several speeches in which he had described certain acts by PKK members, such as digging trenches and putting up barricades in towns, as “resistance”, and had participated in activities of the Democratic Society Congress. He added that the applicant was the subject of several ongoing criminal investigations by the public prosecutor’s office, some of which concerned terrorism-related offences. In the magistrate’s view, those facts were a sufficient basis for a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of membership of an armed terrorist organisation. The magistrate also noted that the offence of forming and leading an armed terrorist organisation – in connection with which the applicant had not been questioned – was among the offences listed in Article 100 § 3 of the CCP. Lastly, taking into account the significance of the case and the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences in question, he held that the measure of pre-trial detention was necessary and proportionate and that alternative measures to detention appeared insufficient."

In its examination of the lawfulness of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court, after outlining the events of 6 to 8 October 2014, found that a causal link could be established between the calls issued by the HDP central executive board and the acts of violence in question. Next, with regard to the “trench events”, the Constitutional Court held that, bearing in mind the statements made by the applicant, the places where he had made them and his position as co-chair of the HDP, his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not devoid of justification. Thus, referring to the content of two speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013, the Constitutional Court observed that there was an indication that an offence had been committed in the case before it. Lastly, having regard to the documents seized during the search of A.D.’s home and the content of the conversations among presumed senior officials of the PKK and between them and the applicant, it found that it had been legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of an armed terrorist organisation. It therefore held that those factors were sufficient grounds for a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence."

In determining whether there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence, the Constitutional Court referred to a number of items of evidence that were not mentioned in the order of 4 November 2016 for his pre-trial detention. In that connection, the Court notes in particular that the speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013 were not among those cited by the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court as justifying his detention. Furthermore, the magistrate did not refer to the telephone conversations mentioned by the Constitutional Court as a ground for the applicant’s pre-trial detention and did not take into account the documents seized during the search of another individual’s home. Those items of evidence were not presented to the courts until after the indictment had been filed on 11 January 2017, more than two months after the applicant’s initial pre-trial detention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to examine the items of evidence in question in order to establish whether the suspicion giving rise to the initial order for the applicant’s pre-trial detention was reasonable, given that they had no bearing on the decision issued on 4 November 2016 by the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court.

                "327. The Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court initially justified the applicant’s pre-trial detention by referring to the tweets posted on the HDP Twitter account. In the three tweets in question, the HDP called for solidarity with the people of Kobani, who at the time were faced with a military offensive launched by members of the armed terrorist organisation Daesh. The Court is prepared to take into account the difficulties faced by Turkey on account of the threat posed by terrorist attacks, particularly in the aftermath of the crisis in Syria. During October 2014, the internal conflict in Syria posed a threat to national security in Turkey. It was against that sensitive background that the HDP posted the tweets in question, calling on the people to take to the streets. Such calls undoubtedly created a difficult situation, particularly in south-eastern Turkey. Indeed, a series of extremely violent incidents occurred after the calls were issued (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above). The Court nevertheless considers that these calls remained within the limits of political speech, in so far as they cannot be construed as a call for violence. The acts of violence that took place between 6 and 8 October 2014, regrettable though they were, cannot be seen as a direct consequence of the tweets in question and cannot justify the applicant’s pre ‑ trial detention in relation to the offences in question."

Next, the Diyarbakır 2nd Magistrate’s Court referred to certain political statements in which the applicant had expressed his view on the events of 6 to 8 October 2014 and the “trench events”, or more generally on the Kurdish question. The content of the applicant’s speeches can be viewed as a very harsh attack on government policy. His opinions on matters such as the “trench events” and his use of concepts such as “resistance” may be regarded as insulting by the State or a sector of the population. They may also offend, shock or disturb them. However, in the speeches in issue the applicant did not call for the use of violent methods and his statements certainly did not amount to terrorist indoctrination, praise for the perpetrator of an attack, the denigration of victims of an attack, a call for funding for terrorist organisations or other similar behaviour (see, for example, Yavuz and Yaylalı v. Turkey, no. 12606/11, § 51, 17 December 2013, and Güler and Uğur, cited above, § 52). In the Court’s view, the speeches would not satisfy an objective observer that the applicant may have committed the offences for which he was placed in pre-trial detention, unless other grounds and evidence justifying his detention were put forward. The notion of “reasonable suspicion” cannot be interpreted so extensively as to impair the applicant’s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention."

Whatever the reason for this statement may have been, the Court accepts that it could be regarded as offensive, shocking, disturbing or polemical by a large proportion of the Turkish population. In this connection, it has previously found that the particular extent and impact of the terrorist activities of the PKK, led by Abdullah Öcalan, in south-eastern Turkey had undoubtedly created a “public emergency threatening the life of the nation” (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 70, Reports 1996-VI). However, as the applicant maintained, the comments were made in a specific context, namely the “solution process”, during which the national authorities had initiated negotiations with PKK leaders, including Abdullah Öcalan, with a view to finding a lasting, peaceful solution to the Kurdish question. The applicant explained that in making the statements in question, he had intended to say that those who were bringing about peace through the solution process deserved to have their success highlighted. In this connection, until the end of the “solution process”, no significant steps were taken against the applicant on account of those comments. Only after the end of the process, more than four years after the speech in question, did the judicial authorities find that it constituted a sufficient basis to justify the applicant’s pre-trial detention, without seeking to ascertain what his intention had been. In the absence of any other grounds and evidence warranting such a measure, the Court is accordingly not persuaded that the speech given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 could justify a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question."

                "334. In his speech on 21 April 2013, the applicant expressed his opinion on the Kurdish movement. On that occasion, he stated first of all that that movement had seen the war as a war of self-defence. Next, he stated that it was wrong to use weapons, since it was possible to resist and succeed using non-violent methods. He added that without the PKK movement, the Kurdish people would not exist in Turkey. The applicant’s statements show that he believed that the Kurdish people in Turkey owed its existence partly to the armed struggle led by that terrorist organisation. This comment may be understood as a description of historical facts linked to the Kurdish question in Turkey, as interpreted by the applicant. It is true that in his speech the applicant referred to the “coup in 1984” and the “resistance in Şemdinli [and] Eruh” as acts that had created the reality of the Kurdish people. Indeed, as the public prosecutor suggested (see paragraph 79 above), it is not unreasonable to say that the applicant described the first terrorist attacks by the PKK as the “coup in 1984” and the “resistance in Şemdinli [and] Eruh”. The Court considers, however, that this speech must likewise be set against the general background of the “solution process”, during which Turkish society openly discussed the origins of the Kurdish question. In the Court’s view, the statements in issue can be seen as the applicant’s assessment of the armed clashes in Turkey rather than as an incitement to violence and glorification of terrorism. Taken as a whole, they cannot be regarded as capable of encouraging the pursuit of violence or exacerbating the security situation in a particular region of Turkey."

However, the applicant argued that the Assize Court had established that this evidence was fabricated. The Court observes that the Government have been unable to provide any evidence to refute the applicant’s contention in that respect.

In addition, in support of the charges, the Diyarbakır public prosecutor presented records of intercepted telephone conversations between S.O. and K.Y., and between K.Y. and the applicant (see paragraph 79 above). According to the prosecutor, the records in question indicated that S.O. had given instructions to the applicant to take part in certain meetings abroad, including at the Council of Europe. The applicant disputed the authenticity of these records. He submitted in that connection that all his requests to have the authenticity of the recordings verified had been rejected by the Assize Court. With regard to the interception of telephone calls, the Court is aware of the importance of such evidence in the fight against organised crime. Nevertheless, when an accused person challenges its authenticity, the judicial authorities are under an obligation to demonstrate its credibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Gäfgen, cited above, § 164, and Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, § 43, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX). This applies all the more where a person’s pre-trial detention is being extended on the basis of such evidence. In the present case, however, the domestic courts do not appear to have sought to verify the authenticity of the records presented by the public prosecutor. However, even assuming that the records are trustworthy, the Court considers that it cannot ascertain from the material in the case file whether the applicant did indeed obey the “instructions” in question. Nor can it see how participation in a programme organised within the Council of Europe in 2008 could constitute a fact justifying the suspicion in question and the applicant’s pre-trial detention several years later."

It concluded under that head that the range of acts that could have justified the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 314 of the Criminal Code was so broad that the content of that provision, coupled with its interpretation by the domestic courts, did not afford adequate protection against arbitrary interference by the national authorities. On that account, it found that the terrorism-related offences at issue, as interpreted and applied in the present case, were not “foreseeable”. In the Court’s view, this consideration is equally valid as regards the charges relating to the applicant’s speeches.

Nevertheless, in view of the importance in a democratic society of the right to liberty and security of a member of parliament, the domestic courts must show, while exercising their discretion, that in ordering a person’s initial and/or continued pre-trial detention, they have weighed up the relevant interests, in particular those of the person concerned as safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 against the public interest depriving that person of his or her liberty where required in the context of criminal proceedings.

This interdependence is particularly pronounced in the case of democratically elected representatives who have been kept in pre-trial detention for expressing their political opinions. Members of parliaments represent their electorate and their freedom of expression therefore requires increased protection. In view of the importance it attaches to the freedom of expression of members of parliament, especially those from opposition parties, in line with the requirements of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, the Court considers that where the detention of a member of parliament cannot be deemed compatible with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, it will also breach Article 3 of Protocol No. 1."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 143, ECHR 2012). Indeed, pre-trial detention is a temporary measure and its duration must be as short as possible. Those considerations apply a fortiori to the detention of a member of parliament. In a democracy, Parliament is an essential forum for political debate, of which the performance of parliamentary duties forms part (see, mutatis mutandis, Cordova (no. 1), cited above, § 59).

It has already held under Article 10 that the interference with the exercise of the applicant’s freedom of expression, in the form of his pre-trial detention for expressing his views as a politician, was not “prescribed by law” in that it did not satisfy the requirement of foreseeability. It has found, in particular, that the domestic courts did not carry out any examination of whether the speeches in issue were covered by the applicant’s parliamentary non ‑ liability as enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution. It has also found that there was no reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence, as required by Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.

Indeed, the Court reiterates that parliamentary immunity is a privilege granted not to members of parliament on an individual basis but to the institution of Parliament, to guarantee its smooth operation (see Kart, cited above, § 53). In that context, if a State provides for parliamentary immunity from prosecution and from deprivation of liberty, the domestic courts must first ensure that the member of parliament concerned is not entitled to parliamentary immunity for the acts of which he or she has been accused. In the present case, however, although the applicant asked the Assize Court to examine whether the impugned speeches were protected under the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Turkish Constitution, the domestic courts did not carry out any such examination, thus failing to comply with their procedural obligations under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 70, 77, 80 and 91 above)."

In the present case, however, the Government have been unable to show that the domestic courts with competence to review the pre-trial detention of the applicant performed a balancing exercise from the standpoint of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 when ruling on the lawfulness of his initial and continued pre-trial detention. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court did not examine whether the offences in question were directly linked to the applicant’s political activities. In its judgment of 21 December 2017, it rejected as inadmissible the applicant’s complaint that, given his status as a member of parliament, his placement in pre-trial detention was in violation of his right to free elections. In its recent judgment of 9 June 2020, it held that the lower courts had failed to consider the applicant’s allegations that his continuing detention was unreasonable given his status as a member of parliament, the co-chair of a political party and a candidate in the presidential election, a finding that, as the Constitutional Court saw it, only concerned his complaint regarding the duration of his pre-trial detention. The Court concludes that the judicial authorities did not effectively take into account the fact that the applicant was not only a member of parliament but also one of the leaders of the political opposition in Turkey, whose performance of his parliamentary duties called for a high level of protection."

The Government have been unable to show that the domestic courts genuinely considered the application of alternative measures to pre-trial detention that are provided for by domestic law. The fact is that the national courts systematically found that such measures were insufficient, without providing any specific reasons connected to the applicant’s individual case."

To that end, the Chamber referred to its reasoning under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and to the socio-political background to the events of recent years in Turkey, as outlined by the parties and the intervening third parties. Following this contextual examination, it held that the applicant’s continued pre-trial detention had also pursued a political purpose. In so holding, it had regard in particular to the applicant’s political role, the tense political situation in Turkey, the speeches targeting the applicant and his party, including those by the President of Turkey, the timing of his continued detention (coinciding with an important constitutional referendum and the presidential election) and the alleged emergence of a systemic trend of “gagging” dissenting voices.

In this connection, the Court observes that although the investigation in respect of the applicant was not initiated in response to the speeches by the President of Turkey, it was at least accelerated after he had given those speeches and stated that ‘the deputies of that party [the HDP] must pay the price’ ... On 16 March 2016 the President accused the HDP members of parliament, including the applicant, of having caused the death of fifty-two people.",

In that context, concordant inferences drawn from this background support the argument that the judicial authorities reacted harshly to the applicant’s conduct, bearing in mind his position as one of the leaders of the opposition, and to the conduct of other HDP members of parliament and elected mayors, as well as to dissenting voices more generally. In this regard, the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any serious argument that could satisfy it that such allegations might be unfounded.",

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant does not see himself solely as an individual victim of a violation. His contention is that he has been kept in pre-trial detention chiefly on account of his position as one of the leaders of the political opposition. The Court considers that in such an eventuality, it is not only the applicant’s rights and freedoms as an individual that could be said to be under threat but the whole democratic system itself.

The applicant asserted that his initial and continued pre-trial detention on account of the political views he had expressed as a member of parliament and co-chair of Turkey’s second largest opposition party had ultimately been aimed at punishing and silencing him. He argued that the real reason for his detention had been the severity of his criticism of the policies pursued by the government and the President of Turkey. In that connection, at a rally held on 7 March 2015, several months before the elections of 7 June 2015, the President of Turkey had stated: “[G]ive me 400 members of parliament and everything will be settled peacefully”, comments which the applicant saw as a call by the President for a change to the country’s constitutional system. In response, on 18 March 2015, at a meeting of his party’s parliamentary group, the applicant had given a brief speech in which he had said: “Dear Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, we will not make you President, we will not make you President, we will not make you President.” In the applicant’s submission, this speech had quickly gone viral and had influenced the overall political climate in the run-up to the June 2015 elections, becoming a key HDP slogan and positioning the party and himself in direct opposition to the President. In that regard, the applicant submitted that the crackdown against members of his party had become more visible, notably after he had stated that he would never support a presidential system with Mr Erdoğan as president."

In addition, several sets of criminal proceedings were currently pending against him, all of them relating to his political activities. However, no criminal investigations had been instituted in respect of any AKP or MHP members of parliament, even though their parliamentary immunity had likewise been lifted. The criminal investigations – which in his view were political in nature – had intensified following the end of the “solution process”. In that connection, the applicant noted that he had been the subject of forty-eight criminal investigations between 2007 and 2014 but that from 2014 until the lifting of his parliamentary immunity, a further forty-eight criminal investigations had been initiated in respect of him. The number of these investigations had to be viewed alongside the number of criminal investigations in respect of other members of parliament from his party. In that connection, according to statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice, as at 15 December 2015 a total of 330 investigation reports had been submitted to Parliament, including 182 relating to HDP members of parliament. Following the speech given by the President of Turkey on 2 January 2016 (see paragraph 49 above), the number of investigation reports submitted to the National Assembly in respect of HDP members of parliament had almost tripled, with the result that as at 20 May 2016, the date on which the constitutional amendment had been adopted, there had been a total of 510 investigation reports relating to HDP members of parliament.

The Government referred to the Chamber’s position that the mere fact that politicians had been prosecuted or placed in pre-trial detention, even during an election campaign or a constitutional referendum, did not automatically indicate that the aim pursued had been to restrict political debate. Moreover, although it was natural that the applicant might have suspicions as to the real reasons for his continued detention on account of his role on the political scene, such suspicions could not suffice for the Court to conclude that the judiciary had been misused ab initio and that the domestic courts had consistently acted in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention. The same applied to the statements by the President of Turkey and by the leaders of the ruling party concerning the applicant; such statements could not be regarded as proof of the existence of an ulterior purpose underlying a judicial decision unless it was established that the courts had not been sufficiently independent from the executive. However, no evidence had been produced in the present case to substantiate any such allegations, and the Chamber judgment had not corroborated them either, instead simply stating that the tense political climate in Turkey during recent years had created an environment capable of influencing the national courts.

In their submission, the contention that the judicial authorities had reacted harshly to the applicant’s conduct had scarcely been substantiated. On the contrary, in November 2017 and January 2018 the applicant had been acquitted following three sets of criminal proceedings instituted against him for incitement to hatred and hostility on account of insults directed at the government or the President and the Minister of the Interior.

In a similar way to Article 14, Article 18 of the Convention has no independent existence ...; it can only be applied in conjunction with an Article of the Convention or the Protocols thereto which sets out or qualifies the rights and freedoms that the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to secure to those under their jurisdiction ... This rule derives both from its wording, which complements that of clauses such as, for example, the second sentence of Article 5 § 1 and the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, which permit restrictions to those rights and freedoms, and from its place in the Convention at the end of Section I, which contains the Articles that define and qualify those rights and freedoms.",

A perusal of the judgments cited ... in the light of the above clarifications shows that what the Court really meant when it spoke of a stricter standard of proof under Article 18 was that it considered that a purpose prescribed by the Convention was invariably a cover for an ulterior one. But if the two points are clearly distinguished, the questions in relation to proof become simply how it can be established whether there was an ulterior purpose and whether it was the predominant one.",

Russia (I) [[GC], no. 13255/07, ECHR 2014 (extracts)] ..., is that, as a general rule, the burden of proof is not borne by one or the other party because the Court examines all material before it irrespective of its origin, and because it can, if necessary, obtain material of its own motion. As early as in Artico v. Italy [13 May 1980, Series A no. 37] ... the Court stated that that was the general position not only in inter-State cases but also in cases deriving from individual applications. It has since then relied on the concept of burden of proof in certain particular contexts. On a number of occasions, it has recognised that a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio, that is that the burden of proof in relation to an allegation lies on the party which makes it, is not possible, notably in instances when this has been justified by the specific evidentiary difficulties faced by the applicants ...",

Indeed, although it relies on the evidence which the parties adduce spontaneously, the Court routinely of its own motion asks applicants or respondent Governments to provide material which can corroborate or refute the allegations made before it. If the respondent Government in question do not heed such a request, the Court cannot force them to comply with it, but can – if they do not duly account for their failure or refusal – draw inferences ... It can also combine such inferences with contextual factors. Rule 44C § 1 of the Rules of Court gives it considerable leeway on that point.",

That possibility is likely to be of particular relevance in relation to allegations of ulterior purpose.",

That standard, however, is not co-extensive with that of the national legal systems which employ it. First, such proof can follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Secondly, the level of persuasion required to reach a conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made, and the Convention right at stake. The Court has consistently reiterated those points ...",

The third aspect of the Court’s approach, also set out as early as in Ireland v. the United Kingdom ..., is that the Court is free to assess not only the admissibility and relevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it. In Nachova and Others [ v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, ECHR 2005-VII] ..., the Court further clarified that point, saying that when assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. It has also stated that it is sensitive to any potential evidentiary difficulties encountered by a party. The Court has consistently adhered to that position, applying it to complaints under various Articles of the Convention ...",

In the present case, the Court reiterates that it has found that the applicant’s pre-trial detention was not based on a “reasonable suspicion” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention (see paragraphs 338 ‑ 339 above). In the Court’s view, the finding of a violation of Article 5 § 1 cannot be regarded as sufficient in itself to conclude that Article 18 of the Convention has also been violated (see Navalnyy, cited above, § 166). It remains for the Court to determine whether, in the absence of reasonable suspicion, there was an identifiable ulterior purpose from the standpoint of Article 18 of the Convention."

In his submission, his initial and continued pre-trial detention was aimed at silencing him. In this connection, in the light of the memorandum by the Commissioner for Human Rights following his visits to Turkey in 2016, the opinion issued by the Venice Commission on the amendments to the Constitution, the report by Amnesty International and the observations by the intervening third parties, the Court observes that in view of the applicant’s role as one of the emblematic leaders of the political opposition in Turkey, the tense political climate since 2014 and the speeches by the applicant’s political opponents, among them the President of Turkey, it is understandable that an objective observer might suspect that the applicant’s initial pre-trial detention and its extension were politically motivated. However, the Court has previously held that the mere fact that politicians had been prosecuted or detained, even during an election campaign or a referendum, did not automatically indicate that the aim pursued had been to restrict political debate (see Merabishvili, cited above, § 323)."

In this context, the Court notes firstly that even before 2014, the public prosecutors had submitted several investigation reports in respect of the applicant to the National Assembly. However, no measure had been taken until the end of the “solution process” and until the elections of 7 June 2015, in which the ruling party lost its majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 2002, largely as a result of the success of the HDP. Indeed, until the onset of the political tension between, on the one hand, the HDP and, on the other, the President and the ruling party, the applicant had not been exposed to the risk of being deprived of his liberty. However, after the end of the “solution process” and the speeches by the President, who had, for example, said on 28 July 2015 that “the leaders of that party [the HDP] must pay the price”, there was an increase in the number and pace of the criminal investigations in respect of the applicant."

                "427. The constitutional amendment adopted on 20 May 2016 lifted the parliamentary inviolability of 154 members of parliament. As a result, the HDP, which at the time had fifty-nine members of parliament, found itself in a situation where fifty-five of them were stripped of the parliamentary immunity they enjoyed under the second paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution. Further to this, fourteen members of parliament from the applicant’s party, including both of its co-chairs, were placed in pre-trial detention. The Court observes that, contrary to what the applicant alleged, the Government maintained that the HDP members of parliament were not the only ones to have been convicted in criminal proceedings. In their submission, five members from the AKP, nine from the CHP and one from the MHP had also been convicted after their parliamentary immunity had been lifted. At the hearing on 18 September 2019, a specific question was put to the parties on this issue of contention. The Government, while repeating their argument, were unable to show that members of parliament belonging to the bloc of the ruling parties, namely the AKP and the MHP, had also been convicted and/or deprived of their liberty. Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence produced to support it, the Court is unable to give any weight to this argument by the Government. It therefore considers it established that members of parliament from the opposition parties, namely the CHP and the HDP, were the only ones to have been detained and/or convicted following the institution of criminal proceedings against them. In other words, members of the National Assembly from the opposition parties were the only ones who were actually affected by the constitutional amendment of 20 May 2016."

Although the Court does not have access to the content of the criminal proceedings against these individuals, it observes that, according to various reports and opinions by international observers, the main reason for the measures depriving them of their liberty lay in their political speeches. In those circumstances, the Court attaches considerable weight to the observations of the intervening third parties, and in particular the Commissioner for Human Rights, who stated that national laws were increasingly being used to silence dissenting voices. The Court therefore considers that the decisions on the applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention are not an isolated example. On the contrary, they seem to follow a certain pattern."

In addition to that, the timing of the applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention is a further factor to take into account in its examination under Article 18 of the Convention.

In this context, the Court observes firstly that the applicant had expressed his firm opposition to any presidential system proposed at the time by President Erdoğan and that this was a matter of significant disagreement between the AKP and HDP leaders. Yet while debate was ongoing among the Turkish public about what was probably one of the most significant constitutional reforms since the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the applicant was in pre-trial detention, in breach of Article 5 §§ 1 and 3, Article 10 and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. As the Court has held, free elections and freedom of expression, and particularly the freedom of political debate, form the foundation of any democracy (see paragraph 383 above). This applies equally in the context of a constitutional referendum. In the Court’s view, the applicant’s pre-trial detention undoubtedly prevented him from contributing effectively to the campaign against the introduction of a presidential system in Turkey."

                "432. The Court also notes the circumstances surrounding the applicant’s return to pre-trial detention (see paragraphs 114 and 118 above). It observes in this connection that on 2 September 2019 the Ankara Assize Court ordered his release. Despite that decision, he remained in detention as a result of his conviction following the criminal proceedings in the Istanbul Assize Court. On 20 September 2019 the Istanbul 26th Assize Court ruled that the days spent by the applicant in pre-trial detention in connection with his trial in the Ankara Assize Court should be deducted from his final sentence. As a result of that decision, the applicant would have been eligible for conditional release. However, later that day and notwithstanding the criminal proceedings pending before the Ankara Assize Court, the Ankara public prosecutor’s office applied to the Ankara Magistrate’s Court to have the applicant and his fellow co-chair returned to pre-trial detention in connection with a separate criminal investigation initiated in 2014 concerning the events of 6 to 8 October 2014. Also on 20 September 2019, the Ankara Magistrate’s Court, granting the public prosecutor’s application, ordered the pre-trial detention of the applicant and the other former co-chair of the HDP. The following day, the President of Turkey made a statement to the press in which he accused the applicant of being the “killer” of fifty-three people. He also said that he was following the matter and that the two co-chairs could not be “let go” (see paragraph 118 above). Accordingly, although the Istanbul Assize Court decided on 31 October 2019 to suspend the execution of the applicant’s sentence of four years and eight months’ imprisonment, he remained deprived of his liberty, this time as a result of his return to pre-trial detention."

However, although the alleged offences were classified differently, this criminal investigation concerned part of the facts forming the basis of the trial that is still ongoing in the Ankara Assize Court, in connection with which the applicant had already been placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 70 above). Considering these aspects together with the close temporal links between the applicant’s release from detention, ordered by the Ankara Assize Court on 2 September 2019 (see paragraph 114 above) and the Istanbul 26th Assize Court’s decision of 20 September 2019 (see paragraph 115 above), his immediate return to pre-trial detention on the same day (see paragraph 117 above) and the speech given by the President immediately afterwards (see paragraph 118 above), the Court is of the view that the domestic authorities do not appear to be particularly interested in the applicant’s suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed between 6 and 8 October 2014, some five years previously, but rather in keeping him detained, thereby preventing him from carrying out his political activities."

In addition, the findings of the Venice Commission on the independence of the judicial system in Turkey, and more specifically those concerning the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (“the Supreme Council”), are also relevant to the Court’s examination under Article 18 of the Convention. In opinion no. 875/2017 on amendments to the Constitution, adopted at its 110th plenary session (see paragraph 162 above), the Venice Commission pointed out that under the new constitutional system, the President would have the power to appoint six of the thirteen members of the Supreme Council, the remaining seven members being appointed by the National Assembly. It noted in that connection that the draft amendments provided for elections to the Supreme Council within thirty days following the entry into force of the constitutional reform. The Venice Commission expressed the view that the proposed new composition of the Supreme Council was “extremely problematic”. It pointed out that under the new constitutional system, the President was not a neutral branch of power but belonged to a political faction. Furthermore, bearing in mind the prospect of the President’s party enjoying a majority in Parliament, which was practically guaranteed under the system of simultaneous elections, the Venice Commission took the view that the composition of the Supreme Council would seriously endanger the independence of the judiciary, because it was the main self-governing body of the judiciary, overseeing appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary measures and the dismissal of judges and public prosecutors. It added that “[g]etting control over [the Supreme Council] thus means getting control over judges and public prosecutors, especially in a country where the dismissal of judges has become frequent and where transfers of judges are a common practice”. The reports and opinions by international observers, in particular the comments by the Commissioner for Human Rights, indicate that the tense political climate in Turkey during recent years has created an environment capable of influencing certain decisions by the national courts, especially during the state of emergency, when hundreds of judges were dismissed, and especially in relation to criminal proceedings instituted against dissenters."

Lastly, they added that only eight of the fifteen HDP members of parliament who had been placed in pre-trial detention in November 2016 were still being detained. In the Court’s view, the facts as set out by the Government might indicate that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State was not systematically misused and that the judicial authorities did not continually act in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention in all cases concerning dissenting voices (see, mutatis mutandis, Năstase v. Romania (dec.), no. 80563/12, § 109, 18 November 2014).

The applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention not only deprived thousands of voters of representation in the National Assembly, but also sent a dangerous message to the entire population, significantly reducing the scope of free democratic debate. These factors enable the Court to conclude that the purposes put forward by the authorities for the applicant’s pre-trial detention were merely cover for an ulterior political purpose, which is a matter of indisputable gravity for democracy (see Cebotari v.

In this connection, it has already considered that in the light of the various factual elements and their close temporal and substantive connection, taken as a whole, the authorities associated with the applicant’s initial and continued pre-trial detention did not appear to be primarily interested in the investigation of his suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed in 2014 (see paragraphs 426-433 above). In the Court’s view, the ultimate aim of the judicial authorities was to deprive the applicant of his liberty notwithstanding the decision by the Ankara Assize Court ordering his release (see paragraph 93 above).The Government argued that the offences for which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention on 20 September 2019 (summarised at paragraphs 116-117 above) were different from those forming the subject matter of the present application because the latter concerned not only the incidents which had taken place from 6 to 8 October 2014, but also included “acts and incidents” indicated in several other investigation reports (see paragraph 415 above). Thus, according to the Government themselves, the detention order of 20 September 2019 also related to the incidents occurring between 6 and 8 October 2014, although it was framed in narrower terms than the charges leading to the applicant’s initial detention. However, instituting new criminal investigations in relation to facts previously considered insufficient to justify detention, by means of a new legal classification, would make it possible for the authorities to circumvent the right to liberty."
