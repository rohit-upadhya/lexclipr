                "55. The Court observes that on 16 June 2005 the applicant was found guilty in proceedings conducted under the Minor Offences Act and sentenced to forty days ’ imprisonment. Under the Croatian legal classification it is not entirely clear whether “ minor offences ” are to be regarded as “ criminal”. Thus, in order to determine whether the applicant was “finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of [the] State”, the first issue to be decided is whether those proceedings concerned a “criminal” matter within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7."

                "56. The Court reiterates that the legal characterisation of the procedure under national law cannot be the sole criterion of relevance for the applicability of the principle of non bis in idem under Article 4 § 1 of Protocol No. 7. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, most recently, Storbråten v. Norway (dec.), no. 12277/04, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ( extracts), with further references ). The notion of “penal procedure” in the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words “criminal charge” and “penalty” in Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention respectively (see Haarvig v. Norway (dec.), no. 11187/05, 11 December 2007; Rosenquist v. Sweden (dec.), no. 60619/00, 14 September 2004; Manasson v. Sweden ( dec .), no. 41265/98, 8 April 2003; Göktan v.

The Court ’ s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “ Engel criteria ” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge”. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, § § 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ ..., and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § § 82-86, ECHR 2003 ‑ X )."

Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that it has previously found that certain offences still have a criminal connotation although they are regarded under relevant domestic law as too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, § 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ ...; Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 57, 15 November 2007; and Ziliberberg v. Moldova, no. 61821/00, § § 32-35, 1 February 2005 )."

By its nature, the inclusion of the offence at issue in the Minor Offences against Public Order and Peace Act served to guarantee the protection of human dignity and public order, values and interests which normally fall within the sphere of protection of criminal law. The corresponding provision of the Act was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The reference to the “minor” nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude their classification as “criminal” in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh, cited above, § 104). Finally, the Court considers that the primary aims in establishing the offence in question were punishment and deterrence, which are recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (ibid., §§ 102 and 105)."

The actual penalty imposed is relevant to the determination but it cannot diminish the importance of what was initially at stake (ibid., § 120). The Court observes that section 6 of the Minor Offences against Public Order and Peace Act provided for sixty days ’ imprisonment as the maximum penalty and that the applicant was eventually sentenced to serve forty days ’ deprivation of liberty. As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be imposed and actually imposed on an applicant involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are “ criminal ”, a presumption which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered “appreciably detrimental” given its nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel, § 82, and Ezeh, § 126, both cited above). In the present case, the Court does not discern any such exceptional circumstances."

A cassation appeal may be lodged with the Russian Supreme Court on the grounds of, inter alia, a breach of the rules of criminal procedure or incorrect application of the criminal law. The proceedings concerning the cassation appeal were regarded as an ordinary stage of the criminal proceedings against the applicant in that case. Conversely, the Court found that a supervisory-review complaint under the Russian procedure was akin to an application for retrial and similar remedies which should not normally be taken into consideration as a remedy under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.

Exercise of these rights is also not subject to a time-limit.",

However, the supervisory- review procedure cannot in any way be compared to a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment under the Croatian Code of Criminal Procedure for the following reasons. As to the nature of the proceedings following a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment in a criminal case, the Court observes that the Croatian Supreme Court may, if it finds the request well-founded, quash the lower courts ’ judgments and remit the case, or in certain cases even decide the case itself. The reasons justifying extraordinary review of a final judgment are expressly enumerated in Article 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and are not subject to any discretionary decision of the court.

The reference to the “minor” nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude their classification as “criminal” in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh, cited above, § 104).

As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be imposed and actually imposed on an applicant involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are “ criminal ”, a presumption which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered “appreciably detrimental” given its nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel, § 82, and Ezeh, § 126, both cited above).

The Court considers that the existence of a variety of approaches to ascertaining whether the offence for which an applicant has been prosecuted is indeed the same as the one of which he or she was already finally convicted or acquitted engenders legal uncertainty incompatible with a fundamental right, namely the right not to be prosecuted twice for the same offence. It is against this background that the Court is now called upon to provide a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the ‘ same offence ’ – the idem element of the non bis in idem principle – for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. While it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that the Court should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases, a failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.

The difference between the terms ‘ same acts ’ or ‘ same cause ’ ( ‘ mêmes faits ’ ) on the one hand and the term ‘ [same] offence ’ ( ‘ [même] infraction ’ ) on the other was held by the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to be an important element in favour of adopting the approach based strictly on the identity of the material acts and rejecting the legal classification of such acts as irrelevant. In so finding, both tribunals emphasised that such an approach would favour the perpetrator, who would know that, once he had been found guilty and served his sentence or had been acquitted, he need not fear further prosecution for the same act ...",

It is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see, among other authorities, Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, § 31, Series A no. 26, and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 75, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ).

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 123, ECHR 2005 ‑ I ).",

The Court further notes that the approach which emphasises the legal characterisation of the two offences is too restrictive on the rights of the individual, for if the Court limits itself to finding that the person was prosecuted for offences having a different legal classification it risks undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 rather than rendering it practical and effective as required by the Convention (compare Franz Fischer, cited above, § 25).",
                "82. Accordingly, the Court takes the view that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second ‘ offence ’ in so far as it arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same.",

The guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 becomes relevant on commencement of a new prosecution, where a prior acquittal or conviction has already acquired the force of res judicata. At this juncture the available material will necessarily comprise the decision by which the first ‘ penal procedure ’ was concluded and the list of charges levelled against the applicant in the new proceedings. Normally these documents would contain a statement of facts concerning both the offence for which the applicant has already been tried and the offence of which he or she stands accused. In the Court ’ s view, such statements of fact are an appropriate starting point for its determination of the issue whether the facts in both proceedings were identical or substantially the same. The Court emphasises that it is irrelevant which parts of the new charges are eventually upheld or dismissed in the subsequent proceedings, because Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 contains a safeguard against being tried or being liable to be tried again in new proceedings rather than a prohibition on a second conviction or acquittal ...",

However, in its decision, the Pazin Minor- Offences Court expressly stated that the applicant was guilty of, inter alia, hitting D.R. on the head with his fists and of punching and kicking him about his entire body.

The most significant contribution of the Zolotukhin judgment was the holding that the determination as to whether the offences in question were the same ( idem ) was to depend on a facts -based assessment ( ibid., § 84), rather than, for example, on the formal assessment consisting of comparing the “essential elements” of the offences. The prohibition concerns prosecution or trial for a second “offence” in so far as the latter arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same ( ibid., § 82)."

In this regard the Supreme Court reiterated its ruling as reported in Norsk Retstidende (“ Rt .” ) 2002 p. 509 (see paragraph 4 5 below) that tax penalties at the ordinary level (30%) were consistent with the notion of “criminal charge” in Article 6 § 1. That earlier assessment had relied on the three so ‑ called “ Engel criteria” (the legal classification of the offence under national law; the nature of the offence; and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring) as spelled out in the Court ’ s judgment in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands ( 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). Of importance for the Supreme Court ’ s assessment was the general preventive purpose of the tax penalty and the fact that, because 30% was a high rate, considerable sums could be involved. The Supreme Court further had regard to its judgment as reported in Rt. 2004 p. 645, where it had held in the light of the Strasbourg case-law ( to the effect that the notion of “ penalty ” should not have different meanings under different provisions of the Convention) that a 30% tax penalty was also a criminal matter for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 – a stance adopted without further discussion in Rt. 2006 p. 1409."

Norway (dec.), no. 12 2 77/04, 1 February 2007; Haarvig v. Norway (dec.), no. 11187/05, 11 December 2007, with references to Malige v.

It found confirmation in Sergey Zolotukhin (cited above, §§ 52-57) – later followed in Ruotsalainen v. Finland (no. 13079/03, §§ 41 ‑ 47, 16 June 2009) – that the three Engel criteria for establishing the existence of a “criminal charge” for the purposes of Article 6 applied equally to the notion of criminal punishment in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7."

That decision had not been appealed against to the highest administrative body within the three-week time-limit, which had expired on 15 December 2008, and was in this sense final. If, on the other hand, the expiry of the six ‑ month time-limit for lodging a judicial appeal under section 11-1(4) of the Tax Assessment Act were to be material, the decision had not yet become final when the District Court delivered its judgment of 2 March 2009."

The words “finally acquitted or convicted” in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 had been formulated with a view to situations where the barring decision was a judgment in a criminal case. The Court had established that a decision was final when it was res judicata, when no further ordinary remedies were available. In this regard, the time when a decision became res judicata according to the rules of national law would be decisive. Neither the wording of the provision, nor its drafting history, nor the case-law provided any guidance for situations where the barring decision was an administrative one. It was pointed out that, in Rt. 2002 p. 557, the Supreme Court had expressed an authoritative view to the effect that a tax assessment decision, including a decision on tax penalties, ought to be regarded as final when the taxpayer was precluded from challenging it (p. 570), without specifying, however, whether it was the time-limit for an administrative appeal, or rather for a judicial appeal, which was decisive. In the present case, the Supreme Court observed that the best solution would be to consider that the three-week time-limit for an administrative appeal was decisive in relation to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. Otherwise, there would be clarity only after six months in cases where the taxpayer did not institute proceedings before the courts and, where he or she did so, only after a legally enforceable judgment – a period that would vary and could be lengthy. The decision of 24 November 2008 was therefore to be considered as final for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7."

Thereafter the case concerning the tax penalties and the criminal case had been conducted in parallel until they had been decided respectively by a decision of 24 November 2008 and a judgment of 2 March 2009. A central question in this case was whether there had been successive prosecutions, which would be contrary to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, or parallel treatment, which was permissible to some extent. In this connection the Supreme Court had regard to two inadmissibility decisions, R.T. v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 31982/96, 30 May 2000; and Nilsson v. Sweden, cited above, in particular the following passage from the latter:",

While the different sanctions were imposed by two different authorities in different proceedings, there was nevertheless a sufficiently close connection between them, in substance and in time, to consider the withdrawal to be part of the sanctions under Swedish law for the offences of aggravated drunken driving and unlawful driving (see R.T. v. Switzerland, cited above, and, mutatis mutandis, Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, § 34, ECHR 2001-VII).

After the first applicant had been charged on 14 December 2007, a warning had followed on 26 August 2008 about an amendment to his tax assessment, then an indictment on 14 October 2008, the tax authorities ’ decision of 24 November 2008 to amend the assessment, and the District Court ’ s judgment of 2 March 2009.

Thus, the High Court found that the tax authorities ’ decision of 5 December 2008 ordering him to pay a tax penalty of 30% did constitute a criminal punishment ( straff ); that the decision had become “final” upon the expiry of the time-limit for lodging an appeal on 26 December 2008; and that the decision on the tax penalty and the subsequent criminal conviction concerned the same matter."

This state of affairs was similar to the case of the first applicant. The second applicant had been indicted and the case referred to the City Court with a request for a summary judgment on the basis of his confession on 11 November 2008, before the decision on the tax penalty. The criminal proceedings had thus reached a relatively advanced stage by the time the decision to impose the tax penalty had been taken. The nine -month period – from when the tax authorities ’ decision of 5 December 2008 had become final until the second applicant ’ s conviction of 30 September 2009 by the City Court – had been somewhat longer than the two-and-a-half -month period in the case of the first applicant. However, this could be explained by the fact that the second applicant had withdrawn his confession in February 2009, with the consequence that he had had to be indicted anew on 29 May 2009 and an ordinary trial hearing had had to be scheduled. Against this background, the High Court (like the City Court) concluded that there was undoubtedly a sufficient connection in substance and time between the decision on the tax penalties and the subsequent criminal conviction."

It found that the Ministry attached significant weight to considerations of general prevention. A strong prospect of a sanction in the form of a tax penalty was viewed as more important than having fewer and stricter (criminal) sanctions. The tax penalty was first and foremost to be a reaction to a taxpayer ’ s having provided incorrect or incomplete returns or information to the tax authorities, and to the considerable work and costs incurred by the community in carrying out checks and investigations. It was considered that those costs should to a certain extent be borne by those who had provided the incorrect or incomplete information ( Rt. 2002 p. 509, at p. 520). The purposes of the rules on ordinary tax penalties were first and foremost characterised by the need to enhance the effectiveness of the taxpayer ’ s duty to provide information and considerations of general prevention ( Rt. 2006 p. 1409). The taxpayer had an extensive duty to provide such information and material as was relevant for the tax assessment. This duty was fundamental to the entire national tax system and was underpinned by a system of audits and effective sanctions in the event of a violation. Tax assessment was a mass operation involving millions of citizens. The purpose of tax penalties was to secure the foundations of the national tax system. It was accepted that a properly functioning taxation system was a precondition for a functioning State and thus a functioning society ( Rt. 2002 p. 509, at p. 525)."

                "It has traditionally been assumed that the notion of idem in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 comprised two elements, one concerning the factual circumstances and another relating to the law. According to this interpretation, the second set of proceedings (in practice, the criminal case) would only concern the same offence as the previous set (in practice, the tax penalty ) if both cases concerned the same facts – ‘ the same conduct ’ – and if the content of the relevant provisions was mainly identical (contained the ‘ same essential elements ’ ).",
                "In its plenary decision in Rt-2006-1409, the Supreme Court found – with particular reference to the European Court ’ s inadmissibility decision of 14 September 2004 in Rosenquist v. Sweden (dec.) no. 60619 /00 – that a decision to impose ordinary tax penalties did not preclude subsequent criminal proceedings, since the two proceedings concerned different offences within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. The majority (14 justices) found that the provision regarding ordinary tax penalties in section 10-2 of the Tax Assessment Act, cf. Section 10-4(1) first sentence, did not contain the same essential elements as the penal provision in section 12-1 of the Tax Assessment Act. In the view of the Supreme Court, the decisive difference lay in the fact that, while the penal provision could only be applied in cases involving intent or gross negligence, ordinary tax penalties were imposed on a more or less objective basis. Reference was also made to the difference in purpose between these sanctions.",
                "In the Grand Chamber judgment in Zolotukhin, the Court carried out an extensive review of the principle of the notion of ‘ idem ’ in Article 4 of the Protocol, which led to the Court deviating from the previously prevailing interpretation. Following Zolotukhin, it is clear that the assessment of whether both proceedings concern the same offence must take place on the basis of the act alone ( see in particular paragraphs 82 and 84 of the judgment). The two sets of proceedings will concern the same offence if they both apply to ‘ identical facts or facts which are substantially the same ’ (paragraph 82). The assessment should therefore ‘ focus on those facts which constitute a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space ... ’ ( paragraph 84).",
                "In the opinion of the Director General of Public Prosecutions, the Supreme Court ’ s view in Rt-2006-1409, which was primarily based on differences in the criterion of guilt, cannot be upheld following the European Court ’ s judgment in Zolotukhin. As long as the imposition of tax penalties and the subsequent criminal case are based on the same act or omission, as will normally be the case, it must be assumed that, pursuant to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the imposition of ordinary tax penalties will also preclude subsequent criminal proceedings. Following discussions with the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes, the Director General of Public Prosecutions understands that the Directorate shares this opinion.",
                "The new notion of ‘ idem ’ in Article 4 of the Protocol will undoubtedly give rise to new questions about how great the differences in factual circumstances must be before sameness is deemed non-existent. However, these questions must be resolved in practice as the cases arise. It should be noted that the discussion in the Zolotukhin judgment indicates that the Court is less inclined to consider a sequence of events as one entity than is Norwegian domestic law in connection with the assessment of whether a continued offence exists.",
                "As is known, the previous Guidelines ( see in particular section 3 of the Director General of Public Prosecutions ’ letter of 26 March 2007 (RA-2007-120) to the regional offices of the public prosecutors and the chiefs of police ) were based on the fact that, for ordinary tax penalties, it was possible to apply the two-track system set out in the Tax Assessment Act. Following the change in the European Court ’ s case ‑ law, it is necessary to apply a ‘ one-track ’ system also as regards ordinary tax penalties.",

If it decided to report the case, no tax penalty was to be imposed. Where a tax penalty was to be imposed, the case was not to be reported to the police.",
                "As regards cases that had been reported to the police, it was pointed out that the imposition of a fine (through a criminal-law penalty notice or judgment) precluded a subsequent decision to impose a tax penalty. If the prosecuting authority found no basis for prosecution, the case was to be referred back to the tax authority for continued consideration and the person concerned was to be informed accordingly.",

Penalty notices that had been accepted ought to be cancelled by the higher prosecuting authority. On the other hand, with reference to the power of discretion under Article 392(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure recognised by the plenary Supreme Court in its judgment in Rt-2003-359, it was not necessary to cancel penalty notices accepted before 10 February 2009, the date of delivery of the Zolotukhin judgment.",
                "(c) As regards cases brought to trial in the first - instance courts – on the basis of an indictment, a non-accepted penalty notice or a request for a judgment rendered on a guilty plea in summary proceedings – the prosecuting authority was to withdraw the case and drop the charges if the trial hearing had not yet taken place or, if it had, enter a claim for the case to be dismissed. Convictions that were not final and enforceable should be appealed against by the prosecution in favour of the convicted person and regardless of the outcome at first instance the prosecutor ought to enter a claim for annulment of the first - instance judgment and dismissal of the case by the courts.",

With respect to the imposition of several criminal sanctions for the same conduct, Article 29 of the 2005 Penal Code ( Straffeloven ) provides that the resultant aggregate sanction must have a reasonable relationship to the offence committed. This provision is a clear expression of the general principle of proportionality that also applied in the Norwegian law on criminal sentencing under the former 1902 Penal Code. In the Supreme Court judgment Rt. 2009 p. 14, which concerned criminal proceedings for tax fraud, it was held to follow from the principles of the 1902 Penal Code that regard should be had to the fact that a defendant had already had imposed on him a sanction – an administrative tax penalty – on account of his tax fraud; with the consequence that he should not be treated more severely than if the criminal offence of tax fraud had been adjudicated on together with the conduct sanctioned in the administrative proceedings. In Rt. 2011 p. 1509, the Supreme Court confirmed an earlier ruling in Rt. 2005 p. 129 that the principle ( stated in Rt. 2004 p. 645) whereby an amount corresponding to the usual 30% administrative tax penalty could be incorporated into the fine, could not extend to criminal tax fraud cases where imprisonment as well as a fine was to be imposed.

                "70. The questions referred by the Haparanda tingsrätt [ District Court] are particularly complex and are just as difficult as the issue which I dealt with above. On the one hand, the imposition of both administrative and criminal penalties in respect of the same offence is a widespread practice in the Member States, especially in fields such as taxation, environmental policies and public safety. However, the way in which penalties are accumulated varies enormously between legal systems and displays special features which are specific to each Member State. In most cases, those special features are adopted with the aim of moderating the effects of the imposition of two punishments by the public authorities. On the other hand, as we shall see below, the European Court of Human Rights recently gave a ruling on this subject and confirmed that such practices, contrary to how things might initially appear, infringe the fundamental right of ne bis in idem laid down in Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR. However, the fact is that not all the Member States have ratified that provision, while others have adopted reservations or interpretative declarations in relation to it. The effect of that situation is that the requirement to interpret the Charter in the light of the ECHR and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Article 52(3) of the Charter) becomes, so to speak, asymmetrical, leading to significant problems when it is applied to this case.",

                "71. The ne bis in idem principle was not an explicit part of the ECHR at the outset. It is common knowledge that the principle was incorporated into the ECHR by means of Protocol No 7, which was opened for signature on 22 November 1984 and entered into force on 1 November 1988. Among other rights, Article 4 contains the guarantee of the ne bis in idem principle, with the aim, according to the explanations on the protocol drawn up by the Council of Europe, of giving expression to the principle pursuant to which no one may be tried in criminal proceedings for an offence in respect of which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted.",
                "72. Unlike the other rights laid down in the ECHR, the right in Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR has not been unanimously accepted by the States signatories to the convention, including a number of Member States of the European Union. As at the date of delivery of this Opinion, Protocol No 7 has still not been ratified by Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Among the Member States which have ratified the protocol, France lodged a reservation to Article 4, restricting its application solely to criminal offences. ... In addition, at the time of signature, Germany, Austria, Italy and Portugal lodged a number of declarations leading to the same situation: restriction of the scope of Article 4 of Protocol No 7 so that the protection under that provision applies only to double punishment in respect of criminal offences, within the meaning laid down in national law. ...",
                "73. The foregoing demonstrates clearly and expressively the considerable lack of agreement between the Member States of the European Union regarding the problems resulting from the imposition of both administrative and criminal penalties in respect of the same offence. The problematic nature of the situation is reinforced in the light of the negotiations on the future accession of the European Union to the ECHR, in which the Member States and the Union have decided to exclude, for the time being, the protocols to the ECHR, including Protocol No 7. ...",
                "74. That lack of agreement can be traced back to the importance of measures imposing administrative penalties in a large number of Member States, in addition to the special significance also afforded to criminal prosecution and penalties in those Member States. On the one hand, States do not wish to abandon the characteristic effectiveness of administrative penalties, particularly in sectors where the public authorities seek to ensure rigorous compliance with the law, such as fiscal law or public safety law. On the other hand, the exceptional nature of criminal prosecution and the guarantees which protect the accused during proceedings incline States to retain an element of decision-making power as regards actions which warrant a criminal penalty. That twofold interest in maintaining a dual – administrative and criminal – power to punish explains why, at the moment, a significant number of Member States refuse, by one means or another, to be bound by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, which, as I shall now go on to examine, has developed in a direction which practically excludes that duality.”"

By these questions, to which it is appropriate to give a joint reply, the Haparanda tingsrätt asks the Court, in essence, whether the ne bis in idem principle laid down in Article 50 of the Charter should be interpreted as precluding criminal proceedings for tax evasion from being brought against a defendant where a tax penalty has already been imposed upon him for the same acts of providing false information.",
                "33. Application of the ne bis in idem principle laid down in Article 50 of the Charter to a prosecution for tax evasion such as that which is the subject of the main proceedings presupposes that the measures which have already been adopted against the defendant by means of a decision that has become final are of a criminal nature.",
                "34. In this connection, it is to be noted first of all that Article 50 of the Charter does not preclude a Member State from imposing, for the same acts of non ‑ compliance with declaration obligations in the field of VAT, a combination of tax penalties and criminal penalties. In order to ensure that all VAT revenue is collected and, in so doing, that the financial interests of the European Union are protected, the Member States have freedom to choose the applicable penalties (see, to this effect, Case 68⁄ 88 Commission v Greece [1989] ECR 2965, paragraph 24; Case C ‑ 213⁄ 99 de Andrade [2000] ECR I ‑ 11083, paragraph 19; and Case C ‑ 91⁄ 02 Hannl-Hofstetter [2003] ECR I ‑ 12077, paragraph 17). These penalties may therefore take the form of administrative penalties, criminal penalties or a combination of the two. It is only if the tax penalty is criminal in nature for the purposes of Article 50 of the Charter and has become final that that provision precludes criminal proceedings in respect of the same acts from being brought against the same person.",
                "35. Next, three criteria are relevant for the purpose of assessing whether tax penalties are criminal in nature. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned is liable to incur (Case C ‑ 489⁄ 10 Bonda [2012] ECR, paragraph 37).",
                "36. It is for the referring court to determine, in the light of those criteria, whether the combining of tax penalties and criminal penalties that is provided for by national law should be examined in relation to the national standards as referred to in paragraph 29 of the present judgment, which could lead it, as the case may be, to regard their combination as contrary to those standards, as long as the remaining penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see, to this effect, inter alia Commission v. Greece, paragraph 24; Case C ‑ 326⁄ 88 Hansen [1990] ECR I ‑ 2911, paragraph 17; Case C ‑ 167⁄ 01 Inspire Art [2003] ECR I ‑ 10155, paragraph 62; Case C ‑ 230⁄ 01 Penycoed [2004] ECR I ‑ 937, paragraph 36; and Joined Cases C ‑ 387⁄ 02, C ‑ 391⁄ 02 and C ‑ 403⁄ 02 Berlusconi and Others [2005] ECR I ‑ 3565 paragraph 65).",
                "37. It follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to the second, third and fourth questions is that the ne bis in idem principle laid down in Article 50 of the Charter does not preclude a Member State from imposing successively, for the same acts of non-compliance with declaration obligations in the field of VAT, a tax penalty and a criminal penalty in so far as the first penalty is not criminal in nature, a matter which is for the national court to determine.”",

From the point of view of legal security, the possibility of conducting parallel proceedings was problematic. The strong underlying aim of this provision of the Protocol in protecting individuals against being forced to bear an excessive burden suggested that the possibilities for the authorities to pursue parallel proceedings ought to be limited."

During their “ nightmare ” experience in this case, so the applicants claimed, they had experienced great relief when the first applicant was called by the tax officer who stated that he could now “ breathe a sigh of relief ” because of new written guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions, dated 3 April 2009, which banned double prosecution and double jeopardy, as in his case. With reference to Zolotukhin, these guidelines provided, inter alia, that at an appellate hearing, whether the lower court had decided on conviction or acquittal, the prosecutor should request that the judgment be set aside and the case be dismissed. By virtue of these new guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the fact that a tax penalty was classified as punishment, and because the decision on the tax penalty had become final and res judicata for the applicants, they reasonably expected that the penal proceedings against them would be discontinued on account of the prohibition against double jeopardy in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. Besides, pursuant to the same new guidelines, other defendants who had been charged with the same offences in the same case-complex had not had tax penalties imposed on them, because they had already been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for violation of section 12-2 of the Tax Assessment Act. The applicants, however, unlike the other defendants in the same case-complex, had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment despite having had additional tax and a tax penalty imposed on them in respect of the same conduct. The Government ’ s argument that an important consideration was the need to ensure equality of treatment with other persons involved in the same tax fraud was thus unconvincing."

They contended that regard ought to be had to such factors as the legal classification of the offence under national law; the nature of the offence; the national legal characterisation of the sanction; its purpose, nature and degree of severity; whether the sanction was imposed following conviction for a criminal offence; and the procedures involved in the adoption and implementation of the sanction (they referred to Malige v.

The Government maintained, inter alia, that the different wording and object of the provisions clearly suggested that the notion of “criminal proceedings” under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 was narrower than the use of “criminal” under Article 6. It transpired from the Explanatory Report in respect of Protocol No. 7 that the wording of Article 4 had been intended for criminal proceedings stricto sensu. In paragraph 28 of that report it was stated that it did not seem necessary to qualify the term offence as “criminal,” since the provision “already contain[ ed ] the terms ‘ in criminal proceedings ’ and ‘ penal procedure ’ which render[ed] unnecessary any further specification in the text of the article itself”. In paragraph 32 it was stressed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 did not prohibit proceedings “of a different character (for example, disciplinary action in the case of an official)”. Moreover, Article 6 and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 safeguarded different, and at times opposite, aims. Article 6 was aimed at promoting procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings."

They referred to Jussila v. Finland ([GC], no. 73053/01, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV), where the Grand Chamber had stated that there were “clearly ‘ criminal charges ’ of differing weight” and that “[t]ax surcharges differ[ed] from the hard core of criminal law” such that “the criminal-head guarantees w[ ould] not necessarily apply with their full stringency”."

The Explanatory Report in respect of Protocol No. 7 confirmed that the ne bis in idem rule was to be construed relatively narrowly.

The question of which proceedings terminated first depended on how the taxation authorities, police, prosecuting authorities or courts progressed, and whether the taxpayer availed himself or herself of an administrative complaint and/or legal proceedings.

Owing to their role of large-scale administration, the administrative authorities would moreover be better placed to ensure that same offences be treated equally. Crime prevention, on the other hand, demanded that the State should not be precluded from prosecuting and punishing crimes within traditional, formal penal procedures where the administrative and criminal proceedings disclosed offences of greater severity and complexity than those which may have led to the administrative process and sanctioning in the first place.

Whilst extending the scope of Article 6 was paramount for the protection of the right to a fair trial, the purpose of the provision in the Protocol was different. Referring to the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in Green v. United States, 355 US 194 (1957), they stressed that the double-jeopardy clause protected an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offence. The underlying idea was that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offence, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though innocent, he may be found guilty.

Article 7 of the Convention referred to the notions of conviction (“held guilty” in English; “ condamné ” in French), “criminal offence ” (“ infraction ” in French) and “ penalty ” (“ peine ” in French), which were also to be found in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. Furthermore, the protection afforded by Article 7 of the Convention, like that afforded by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, concerned essential components of criminal procedure, understood in a strict sense.

In seeking to determine whether a measure fell within the scope of the latter, the Court ought to consider: the legal classification of the offence in domestic law; the purpose and nature of the measure concerned; whether the measure was imposed following conviction for a criminal offence; the severity of the penalty, it being understood that this was not a decisive element; and the procedures associated with the adoption of the measure (and in particular whether the measure was adopted by a body which could be characterised as a court and which adjudicated on the elements of an offence regarded as criminal within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention).

At the time of adoption of the Protocol in 1984, other exceptions, such as those subsequently allowed by the relevant case-law, were not provided for – and did not require such provision in view of the inherently criminal focus of the protection concerned. The narrow conception underlying the guarantee was tellingly confirmed at Article 4 § 3, which ruled out any derogation under Article 15 of the Convention in respect of the protection provided by Article 4 § 1. The ne bis in idem guarantee was thus placed on an equal footing with the right to life (Article 2; Article 3, Protocol No. 6; Article 2, Protocol No. 13), the prohibition of torture (Article 3), the prohibition of slavery (Article 4) and the principle of no punishment without law (Article 7). These elements militated in favour of a restrictive interpretation of the protection.

Its primary purpose was to punish the most serious forms of misconduct. In its decision in Rosenquist v. Sweden ( (dec.), no. 60619/00, 14 September 2004 ), the Court had observed that the purpose of prosecuting the criminal offence of tax evasion differed from that of the imposition of a fiscal penalty, the latter seeking to secure the foundations of the national tax system.",

Not to bring the most serious cases of tax evasion to trial where a tax penalty had already been imposed would be to deprive the State of the exemplary force of, and publicity provided by, criminal convictions in such cases.",
                "In the event that a judicial investigation in a matter of tax evasion was set in motion prior to an audit by the tax authority, an obligation to discontinue the second action once the outcome of the first had become final would encourage the taxpayer to let the criminal proceedings reach a swift conclusion, without denying the charge, in such a way that those proceedings would be terminated in advance of the tax audit and the administrative sanctions, which generally represented much larger sums, would thus be avoided.",

It would be paradoxical indeed for taxpayers who had committed the most serious forms of tax fraud and who were prosecuted for such offence, to receive less severe penalties.",
                "In conclusion, complementary criminal and administrative action was essential in dealing with the most serious tax fraud cases and it would be artificial to consider that, simply because two sets of proceedings and two authorities came into play, the two forms of sanction did not form a coherent whole in response to this type of offence. The two types of proceedings were in reality closely connected and it ought therefore be possible for them both to be pursued.",

However, the fiscal and criminal proceedings ought to be regarded as connected in substance and in time where there was an exchange of information between the two authorities and where the two sets of proceedings were conducted simultaneously. The facts of the case would demonstrate the complementary nature of the proceedings.",

It did not, on the other hand, appear relevant, in assessing the closeness of the connection in time between the two sets of proceedings, to consider the duration of the judicial proceedings before the courts called upon to deliver judgment in the criminal case and rule on the validity of the tax penalties. It ought to be borne in mind that the response time of the various courts depended on external factors, sometimes attributable to the taxpayer concerned.

Whilst Article 6 is limited to embodying fair-hearing guarantees for criminal proceedings, the prohibition of double jeopardy in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 has certain implications – potentially wide ones – for the manner of applying domestic law on criminal and administrative penalties across a vast range of activities. The latter Article involves a more detailed assessment of the substantive criminal law, in that there is a need to establish whether the respective offences concerned the same conduct ( idem ). These differences, the lack of consensus among the domestic systems of the Contracting States and the variable willingness of States to be bound by the Protocol and the wide margin of appreciation to be enjoyed by the States in deciding on their penal systems and policies generally (see Nykänen, cited above, § 48; and, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

It does not seem justified for the Court to depart from that analysis in the present case, as there are indeed weighty considerations that militate in favour of such a choice. The ne bis in idem principle is mainly concerned with due process, which is the object of Article 6, and is less concerned with the substance of the criminal law than Article 7.

                "The Court found that the licence withdrawal had been a direct and foreseeable consequence of the applicant ’ s earlier conviction for the same offences of aggravated drunken driving and unlawful driving and that the withdrawal on the ground of a criminal conviction constituted a “criminal” matter for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. Furthermore, the severity of the measure – suspension of the applicant ’ s driving licence for 18 months – was in itself so significant, regardless of the context of his previous criminal conviction, that it could ordinarily be viewed as a criminal sanction. While the different sanctions were imposed by two different authorities in different proceedings, there was nevertheless a sufficiently close connection between them, in substance and in time, to consider the withdrawal to be part of the sanctions under Swedish law for the offences of aggravated drunken driving and unlawful driving. The licence withdrawal did not imply that the applicant had been “tried or punished again ... for an offence for which he had already been finally ... convicted”, in breach of Article 4 § 1 of Protocol No. 7.",

These cases concerned Finland (notably Glantz, cited above, § 57 and Nykänen, cited above, § 47) and Sweden ( Lucky Dev v. Sweden, no. 7356/10, § 58, 27 November 2014). In Nykänen, which set out the approach followed in the other cases against Finland and Sweden, the Court found on the facts that, under the Finnish system, the criminal and the administrative sanctions had been imposed by different authorities without the proceedings being in any way connected: both sets of proceedings followed their own separate course and became final independently of each other. Moreover, neither of the sanctions had been taken into consideration by the other court or authority in determining the severity of the sanction, nor was there any other interaction between the relevant authorities. More importantly, under the Finnish system the tax penalties had been imposed following an examination of an applicant ’ s conduct and his or her liability under the relevant tax legislation, which was independent from the assessments made in the criminal proceedings. In conclusion, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention since the applicant had been convicted twice for the same matter in two separate sets of proceedings.",

It would not seem unreasonable to deduce from these judgments in cases against Finland and Sweden that, given that the two sets of proceedings were largely contemporaneous, in the particular circumstances it was the lack of a substantive connection that gave rise to the violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7."

Its finding that the new set of proceedings concerned a second “offence” originating in identical acts to those which had been the subject-matter of the first, and final, conviction was sufficient for the Court to conclude that there had been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7."

Four States (Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom) have not ratified the Protocol; and one of these (Germany) plus four States which did ratify (Austria, France, Italy and Portugal) have expressed reservations or interpretative declarations to the effect that “criminal” ought to be applied to these States in the way it was understood under their respective national laws.

On this point, the conclusion in paragraph 51 of Nykänen ( quoted above ) and in a number of judgments thereafter that “both sets of proceedings follow their own separate course and become final independently from each other” is to be treated as a finding of fact: in the Finnish system under consideration there was not a sufficient connection in substance between the administrative proceedings and the criminal proceedings, although they were conducted more or less contemporaneously.

Nonetheless, as explained above (see notably paragraphs 111 and 117-120 ), Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not exclude the conduct of dual proceedings, even to their term, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In particular, for the Court to be satisfied that there is no duplication of trial or punishment ( bis ) as proscribed by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the respondent State must demonstrate convincingly that the dual proceedings in question have been “sufficiently closely connected in substance and in time”. In other words, it must be shown that they have been combined in an integrated manner so as to form a coherent whole.

What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a ‘ criminal charge ’ by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law, for example administrative penalties ..., prison disciplinary proceedings ..., customs law ..., competition law ..., and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters .... Tax surcharges differ from the hard core of criminal law; consequently, the criminal-head guarantees will not necessarily apply with their full stringency ... ”.",
                "The above reasoning reflects considerations of relevance when deciding whether Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 has been complied with in cases concerning dual administrative and criminal proceedings. Moreover, as the Court has held on many occasions, the Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 68, Series A no. 28; also Maaouia v. France [GC], no. 39652/98, § 36, ECHR 2000-X; Kudła v.

                "The extent to which the administrative proceedings bear the hallmarks of ordinary criminal proceedings is an important factor. Combined proceedings will more likely meet the criteria of complementarity and coherence if the sanctions to be imposed in the proceedings not formally classified as \"criminal\" are specific for the conduct in question and thus differ from \"the hard core of criminal law\" (in the language of Jussila cited above). The additional factor that those proceedings do not carry any significant degree of stigma renders it less likely that the combination of proceedings will entail a disproportionate burden on the accused person. Conversely, the fact that the administrative proceedings have stigmatising features largely resembling those of ordinary criminal proceedings enhances the risk that the social purposes pursued in sanctioning the conduct in different proceedings will be duplicated ( bis ) rather than complementing one another. The outcome of the cases mentioned in paragraph 129 above may be seen as illustrations of such a risk materialising."

Moreover, as already intimated above, where the connection in substance is sufficiently strong, the requirement of a connection in time nonetheless remains and must be satisfied. This does not mean, however, that the two sets of proceedings have to be conducted simultaneously from beginning to end. It should be open to States to opt for conducting the proceedings progressively in instances where doing so is motivated by interests of efficiency and the proper administration of justice, pursued for different social purposes, and has not caused the applicant to suffer disproportionate prejudice. However, as indicated above, the connection in time must always be present. Thus, the connection in time must be sufficiently close to protect the individual from being subjected to uncertainty and delay and from proceedings becoming protracted over time (see, as an example of such shortcoming, Kapetanios and Others, cited above, § 67), even where the relevant national system provides for an “integrated” scheme separating administrative and criminal components.

In its view, the circumstance that the first set became “final” before the second does not affect the assessment given below of the relationship between them (see paragraph 12 6 above)."

                "144. The competent national authorities found that the first applicant ’ s reprehensible conduct called for two responses, an administrative penalty under chapter 10 on Tax Penalties of the Tax Assessment Act and a criminal one under chapter 12 on Punishment of the same Act (see paragraphs 15, 16 and 41 -43 above ), each pursuing different purposes. As the Supreme Court explained in its judgments of May 2002 (see paragraph 46 above), the administrative penalty of a tax surcharge served as a general deterrent, as a reaction to a taxpayer ’ s having provided, perhaps innocently, incorrect or incomplete returns or information, and to compensate for the considerable work and costs incurred by the tax authorities on behalf of the community in carrying out checks and audits in order to identify such defective declarations; it was concerned that those costs should to a certain extent be borne by those who had provided incomplete or incorrect information. Tax assessment was a mass operation involving millions of citizens. For the Supreme Court, the purpose of ordinary tax penalties was first and foremost to enhance the effectiveness of the taxpayer ’ s duty to provide complete and correct information and to secure the foundations of the national tax system, a precondition for a functioning State and thus a functioning society. Criminal conviction under chapter 12, on the other hand, so the Supreme Court stated, served not only as a deterrent but also had a punitive purpose in respect of the same anti-social omission, involving the additional element of the commission of culpable fraud."

                "145. Thus, following a tax audit carried out in 2005, the tax authorities filed a criminal complaint against the first applicant along with others in the autumn of 2007 (see paragraph 13 above ). In December 2007 he was interviewed as an accused and was held in custody for four days (see paragraph 14 above ). With reference, inter alia, to the criminal investigation, in August 2008 the tax authorities warned him that they would amend his tax assessment, including in respect of the year 2002, on the ground that he had omitted to declare NOK 3,259,341. That warning was issued against the background of the tax audit conducted by the tax authorities at Software Innovation AS, the ensuing criminal investigation and the evidence given by him in those proceedings (see paragraph 16 above ). In October 2008 the Økokrim indicted the applicant in respect of the tax offences. On 24 November 2008 the tax authorities amended his tax assessment and ordered him to pay the tax penalty at issue. The decision had regard, inter alia, to evidence given by the first and second applicants during interviews in the criminal investigation. A little more than two months later, on 2 March 2009, the District Court convicted him of tax fraud in relation to his failure to declare the said amount on his tax return for 2002. The Court regards it as particularly important that, in sentencing him to one year ’ s imprisonment, the District Court, in accordance with general principles of national law on criminal sentencing (see paragraph 50 above), had regard to the fact that the first applicant had already been significantly sanctioned by the imposition of the tax penalty (see paragraph 17 above; compare and contrast Kapetanios and Others, cited above, § 66, where the administrative courts imposing administrative fines failed to take into account the applicants ’ acquittal in previous criminal proceedings relating to the same conduct; and also Nykänen, cited above, where there was found to be no sufficient connection in substance between the two sets of proceedings)."

                "Thirdly, it seems clear that, as held by the Supreme Court, the criminal proceedings and the administrative proceedings were conducted in parallel and were interconnected (see paragraph 29 above ).

As to the details of the relevant proceedings, following their tax audit in 2005 the tax authorities filed a criminal complaint with Økokrim in the autumn of 2007 also against the second applicant (as they had done against the first applicant and others) in relation to his failure to declare NOK 4,561,881 (approximately EUR 500,000) in income for the tax year 2002 (see paragraph 31 above ). With reference in particular to the tax audit, the criminal evidence given by him in the relevant criminal investigation and documents seized by Økokrim in the investigation on 16 October 2008, the Tax Administration warned him that it was considering amending his tax assessment on the ground that he had omitted to declare the said income and imposing a tax penalty (see paragraph 32 above ). On 11 November 2008 the public prosecutor indicted the applicant on a charge of tax fraud in relation to his failure to declare the aforementioned amount, which represented a tax liability of NOK 1,302,526, and requested the City Court to pass a summary judgment based on the second applicant ’ s confession (see paragraph 33 above ). The criminal proceedings had reached a relatively advanced stage by 5 December 2008 when the Tax Administration amended his tax assessment to the effect that he owed the latter amount in tax and ordered him to pay the tax penalty in question (see paragraph 32 above).",

However, as also explained by the High Court (see paragraph 39 above), this was due to the fact that the second applicant had withdrawn his confession in February 2009, with the consequence that he had had to be indicted anew on 29 May 2009 and an ordinary adversarial trial hearing had had to be scheduled (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above ). This circumstance, resulting from a change of stance by the second applicant, cannot of itself suffice to disconnect in time the tax proceedings and the criminal proceedings. In particular, the additional lapse of time before the criminal trial hearing cannot be considered disproportionate or unreasonable, having regard to its cause. And what remains significant is the fact that, as for the first applicant, the tax penalty was indeed taken into account by the City Court in fixing the sentence in the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 35 above)."

Although the summary penal order contained only two sentences relevant to the establishment of the facts, it transpires that the fine was issued on the ground that he had used a more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil in the tank of his van without having paid due additional tax and that he had filled the tank himself (see paragraph 7 above)."

The police must be considered to have based the summary penal order on the fact that the applicant had “otherwise acted fraudulently” and thereby caused or attempted to cause a tax not to be assessed.

The fuel fee debit was imposed because the applicant’s pickup van had been run on more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil and it was then trebled because he had not given prior notice of this fact. This latter factor has above been considered to have amounted to a punishment to deter re-offending. Thus, the facts in the two sets of proceedings hardly differ albeit there was the requirement of intent in the first set of proceedings. The facts of the two offences must, the Court considers, therefore be regarded as substantially the same for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7.

Formally, the use of more leniently taxed fuel was not forbidden, but it was subject to fairly severe financial sanctions. The basic structure of the Fuel Fee Act and the Motor Vehicle Tax Act was identical to, for example, the Penal Code, which does not specifically forbid certain unwanted acts but only provides for the consequences of such acts. The only difference was that the sanction applicable to the use of fuels was an administrative sanction collected as a tax. The basic aim of the provisions on additional tax and fuel fee is well established in Finland. The provisions are well-known among motorists and the consequence is that, compared with other countries, more leniently taxed fuel is hardly ever used in road traffic in Finland.

The principal purpose of the fuel fee was to ensure that more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil was not used in diesel vehicles. The fuel fee alone had no fiscal purpose. He could have used a more leniently taxed fuel by notifying the authorities of such use and by paying a daily fee amounting to some EUR 252. However, it had not been possible to drive the pickup van during a single day such a distance as to make the use of such fuel financially viable. The result of the failure to give prior notice had been that the applicant had been considered to have used more leniently taxed fuel for a period of twenty days although his statement that the use involved one fill-up of the fuel tank had not been proved wrong. The consequences were out of all proportion and unreasonable taking into consideration even the absolute benefit sought through the offence, that is, the difference in price between fuel taxed as diesel oil and more leniently taxed fuel, the reprehensibility and unique nature of the act, the financial position and actions of the offender and other circumstances. The applicant’s application for exemption from payment of the fuel fee or a decrease thereof had been unsuccessful.

                "28. The applicant considered that the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel had technically been in existence even prior to the entry into force in 2004 of the new Fuel Fee Act. The legislation provided for a high fuel fee so as to render the actual use of such fuel impossible. In practice, few notifications were made of the use of more leniently taxed fuel oil in cars and vans. A prohibition on the use of light fuel oil had not even been proposed in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. It was only added to the Bill during consideration in the Finance Committee (report no. 37/2003 vp). This demonstrated that the State had long held that the notification procedure including sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles. The applicant took the view that the essential elements of the punishable offence were identical in the provision on petty tax fraud and in the Fuel Fee Act. Likewise, the administrative fuel fee and the penal sanction resulting from petty tax fraud were imposed for one and the same act. Under the wording of sections 3-4 and 6 of the Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was imposed for failure to observe the notification obligation. According to the essential elements of tax evasion in the Penal Code, a person who for the purpose of avoiding tax fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation or influencing the assessment of tax shall be sentenced for tax fraud. The use of the more leniently taxed fuel would have been permissible subject to payment of a daily fee. The increased fuel fee was imposed for failure to submit a prior notification. It was for precisely the same reason, that is failure to observe the notification obligation, that the fine had been imposed. The fuel fee had thus not been imposed because the use of more leniently taxed fuel was prohibited as such. The fact of the fuel fee being imposed irrespective of intent or negligence only served to underscore the citizens’ need for judicial relief and it did not change the essentially criminal nature of the fuel fee. The Fuel Fee Act and the Penal Code had the same structure, a stand which was also taken in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act."

In practice, the owner or holder of a vehicle cannot be unaware of the type of fuel used in that vehicle. In theory, the fuel tank of a vehicle could be filled with more leniently taxed fuel during unauthorised use. Any occurrence of such a scenario would again only underscore the need of citizens for judicial relief. In the case of Västberga Taxi Aktiebolag and Vulic v. Sweden, no. 36985/97, 23 July 2002) the Court held that the question of whether a tax or tax surcharge could be converted into a prison sentence was not decisive for the classification of an offence as “criminal”.

In the former case the tax consequence was based on accounts, that is, the amount of tax actually evaded. In the present case, the amount of tax actually evaded had not been established but it seemed indisputable that the fuel fee significantly exceeded the amount of tax actually evaded. In the case of Ponsetti and Chesnel, interest on arrears and tax surcharge amounted to 40-80%. In the present case, the tax was increased by 300%. The former case involved chronic and repeated failure whereas the present case involved a single instance of failure of short duration. In the former case, the essential elements of tax fraud differed from those of failure to file tax returns in a timely fashion, whereas in the present case the essential elements of tax fraud and failure to notify were the same. Moreover, the acts in the present case were congruous."

The Government submitted that the aim of the Fuel Fee Act in force at the relevant time was to ensure that the State would in all circumstances, in respect of diesel vehicles, obtain at least the same amount of tax that accrued from the use of diesel oil instead of the generally available and more leniently taxed light fuel oil. The primary purpose of the legislation was to ensure the use of diesel oil in diesel vehicles. At that time, the legislation did not contain any formal prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and therefore it was necessary to make the use of such fuel financially less advantageous than the use of diesel oil. This was ensured by providing for a high flat-rate tax (the fuel fee). Although the use of a more leniently taxed fuel was not prohibited, anyone who used such fuel was obliged to give prior notification. The fee was imposed irrespective of whether the person in question defaulted on the notification obligation intentionally or through carelessness since this guaranteed the State’s tax income irrespective of how the conduct of the tax payer was assessed. The amount of the fuel fee depended solely on the vehicle type. Failure to comply with the notification obligation resulted in the fuel fee being collected threefold. Furthermore, a fuel fee could only be reduced in individual cases for particular reasons. Although the increased fuel fee had the nature of an administrative sanction, its main objective was to collect tax revenue and to safeguard the operation of the fuel taxation system. According to the new Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was, unlike before, a sanction for a violation of a prohibition laid down in the Act. However, the purpose of the fee remained unchanged, that is, to ensure the proper accrual of tax revenue."

            [
                "32. The Government submitted that petty tax fraud was an offence under the Penal Code punishable in criminal proceedings by a fine (the amount of the day-fine being dependent on the income and assets of the person concerned). Failure to pay a fine resulted in its being converted to a prison sentence. The increased fuel fee was not a penal sanction but an administrative one, imposed in an administrative procedure and could not, therefore, be equated to a determination of a criminal charge against the applicant. This was also reflected in the new Fuel Fee Act, which contained an express prohibition on the of use light fuel oil. This change to the legislation resulted from the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 27 November 2003 concerning Finland (Case C-185/00: Commission of the European Communities v. Republic of Finland ) in which the European Court of Justice deemed that Community legislation obliged Finland to amend its legislation so as to ensure, more efficiently than before, that fuels were used in compliance with fuel directives (see Council Directive 92/81/EEC on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils and Council Directive 92/82/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils, both replaced by Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity ). As to the applicant’s view that the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel had technically been in existence also before the amendment, the Government submitted that it was indeed true that the rate of the fuel fee was so high that its payment was disadvantageous even if the person concerned only had to pay the basic amount. However, in the above-mentioned judgment it had been found that Finland had failed to fulfil its obligations under Community law. Thus, the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and the fact that the sanction for using the wrong fuel was severe, have been found to constitute different legal issues. As to the applicant’s submission that the State had long held that the notification procedure inclusive of sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles, the Government submitted that this was true, and that this fact had also been relied on before the European Court of Justice. However, it did not render the fuel fee a criminal law sanction nor a sanction of a comparable nature, as its aim was specifically to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels."

                "33. The Government argued that although the increased fuel fee could be considered quite substantial, the essential elements of the acts leading to its imposition on the one hand and to punishment for petty tax fraud on the other differed significantly from each other and did not constitute one and the same act on the following grounds. Firstly, the administrative fuel fee was imposed for using a fuel that was taxed more leniently than diesel oil whereas the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud was imposed for illegal evasion of the fuel fee, the punishable act being failure to comply with the notification obligation laid down in the Fuel Fee Act. Thus, the administrative fuel fee and the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud were imposed for different acts. Secondly, the sanction provided for in the Penal Code always necessitated intent or at least negligence, and petty tax fraud was always intentional and thus essentially involved a subjective element. By contrast, the fuel fee was imposed, irrespective of the degree of intent, on the basis of the mere objective fact that the fuel system of a vehicle contained the wrong fuel. Thirdly, the purpose of the criminal sanction for tax fraud was to constitute a punishment and to express moral reproach for a certain act. The fuel fee did not have a similar purpose of punishment or reproach. It was only intended to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels. Moreover, the higher fuel fee was not intended to be a punishment, but only to ensure that vehicle users gave prior notification if they wanted to use a more leniently taxed fuel. Fourthly, the fuel fee system in force at the relevant time also differed from a punishment in that it made it legally possible for vehicle owners to choose to use a tax-free fuel, to notify the authorities of this and to pay the fuel fee, an option which was not open in respect of acts regulated by criminal law. Fifthly, only a perpetrator or an accomplice comparable with the perpetrator could be sentenced to a sanction under criminal law. Emphasis should be put on the fact that owners or holders of a vehicle had to pay the fuel fee irrespective of whether they used the fuel concerned. Sixthly, an unpaid fine could be converted to imprisonment whereas an unpaid fuel fee could not. Seventhly, criminal cases were examined by general courts whereas cases concerning fuel fees were examined in an administrative procedure, like tax cases, and finally through an appeal to an administrative court."

The Government argued that the present case was similar to the case of Ponsetti and Chesnel (cited above) in that the constitutive elements of tax fraud and those of failure to file tax returns within the prescribed period (“the fiscal offence”) were different. The cases were also similar in that tax fraud included the element of “wilfulness” whereas the “fiscal offence” was possible on solely objective grounds. On the other hand, when compared to the aforementioned case, it could be noted that in respect of the fuel fee in the present case, the acts underlying the sanctions were even more clearly composed of different elements than the acts giving rise to a tax penalty, as the fuel fee could, on the conditions mentioned in the foregoing, be imposed even if there had been no intention of tax evasion."

This common feature was also referred to in the Government Bill (112/2003) for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. However, the purpose of the reference was only to indicate that the fuel fee must be considered an effective means of ensuring the collection of fuel tax or of a corresponding amount of taxes, irrespective of whether the fuel fee was based on a prohibition of use. A further reason for the inclusion of the aforementioned comparison of the Fuel Fee Act with the Penal Code was the case pending before the European Court of Justice. The purpose was only to indicate that the objectives of legislation may be achieved even if not based on a prohibition.

                "43. The Court’s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “ Engel criteria” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge”. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 86, ECHR 2003 ‑ X). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, § 54, and Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, § 55). This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ ..., and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 82-86)."

                "44. As noted above, first, the applicant was fined in summary penal order proceedings because he had used more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil in the tank of his vehicle, which constituted petty tax fraud. The proceedings were “criminal” according to the Finnish legal classification. Those proceedings were “criminal” also for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 and consequently the applicant was “finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of [the] State”. The guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 comes into play where a new set of proceedings is instituted after the previous acquittal or conviction has acquired the force of res judicata. In this case, the applicant did not appeal against the summary penal order, which therefore became res judicata."
            ],
            [
                "45. Subsequently, the applicant was issued with a fuel fee debit in administrative proceedings. Turning to the first of the Engel criteria, it is apparent that the fuel fee debit was not classified as criminal but as part of the fiscal regime (see paragraph 12 above). This is however not decisive. In this connection, the Court has previously found that the sphere defined in the Finnish legal system as “administrative” embraces certain offences that have a criminal connotation but are too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], cited above, § 38)."
            ],
            [
                "46. The second criterion, the nature of the offence, is the more important. The Court observes that the relevant provision of the Fuel Fee Act was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The applicant was liable in his capacity as owner or user of a diesel engine vehicle. As to the Government’s argument that the fuel fee debit was intended as pecuniary compensation for damage, the Court is however not so convinced in the circumstances of the present case. It may well be that the fuel fee imposed corresponded to the damage caused, namely loss of revenue. It is however to be noted that the fuel fee collected was trebled. This must in the Court’s view be seen as a punishment to deter re-offending, recognised as a characteristic feature of criminal penalties (see Ezeh, §§ 102 and 105). It may therefore be concluded that the fuel fee debit was imposed by a rule whose purpose was not only compensatory but also deterrent and punitive. The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence."

Seeking to put an end to this legal uncertainty the Court decided to provide a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the “same offences” – the idem element of the non bis in idem principle."

The Court notes that the statement of the facts in the decisions by which the “penal procedures” were concluded are an appropriate starting point for its determination of the issue of whether the facts in both proceedings were identical or substantially the same. The Court’s inquiry should therefore focus on those facts which constitute a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked in time and space."

                "51. The Court will begin its analysis of the circumstances in the instant case by reviewing the events of 17 January 2001 and the fine imposed and the fuel fee levied on the applicant. On 26 February 2001 the applicant was fined under Chapter 29, Article 3, of the Penal Code and sections 20 and 33 of the Motor Vehicle Tax Act for petty tax fraud or, more precisely, a motor vehicle tax offence. Although the summary penal order contained only two sentences relevant to the establishment of the facts, it transpires that the fine was issued on the ground that he had used a more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil in the tank of his van without having paid due additional tax and that he had filled the tank himself (see paragraph 7 above)."

In the subsequent administrative proceedings the applicant was issued with a fuel fee debit on the ground that his pickup van had been noted to have been used during the year 2001 with fuel more leniently taxed than diesel oil. As he had failed to inform the Vehicle Administration or the Customs of the use in advance, the fuel fee collected was to be trebled. The decision also noted that the applicant had conceded that he had used the wrong fuel in his vehicle."
            ],
            [
                "53. This recapitulation of the events and sanctions demonstrates that since the same conduct on the part of the same defendant and within the same time frame is in issue, the Court is required to verify whether the facts of the offence for which the applicant was fined and those of the offence by reason of which he was issued with a fuel fee debit were identical or substantially the same."
            ],
            [
                "54. The definition of the offences of “tax fraud” and “petty tax fraud” under Chapter 29, Articles 1 and 3, of the Penal Code referred to various types of prohibited conduct (see paragraph 23 above). Each of these elements was in itself sufficient for a finding of guilt. The police must be considered to have based the summary penal order on the fact that the applicant had “otherwise acted fraudulently” and thereby caused or attempted to cause a tax not to be assessed. It was also considered essential that the applicant had filled the tank himself."
            ],
            [
                "55. In the ensuing administrative proceedings the applicant was issued with a fuel fee debit on the ground that his car had been run on more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil. The fuel fee debit was trebled on the ground that the applicant had not given prior notice of this fact. Although the Administrative Court’s decision noted that the applicant had admitted having used the wrong fuel, the imposition of the fuel fee debit did not require intent on the part of the user of the wrong fuel."
            ],
            [
                "56. To sum up, the facts that gave rise to the summary penal order against the applicant related to the fact that he had used more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil in his pickup van without having paid additional tax for the use. The fuel fee debit was imposed because the applicant’s pickup van had been run on more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil and it was then trebled because he had not given prior notice of this fact. This latter factor has above been considered to have amounted to a punishment to deter re-offending. Thus, the facts in the two sets of proceedings hardly differ albeit there was the requirement of intent in the first set of proceedings. The facts of the two offences must, the Court considers, therefore be regarded as substantially the same for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. As the Court has held, the facts of the two offences serve as its sole point of comparison (see Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia [GC], cited above, § 97). Lastly, the Court notes that the latter proceedings did not fall within the exceptions envisaged by the second paragraph of the said provision."

As regards the absence of a penalty, the Court observes that it is only where a penalty has been imposed that Article 54 of the CISA lays down the condition that the penalty has been enforced, is actually in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the laws of the Contracting State of origin.",
                "41. The reference to a penalty cannot therefore be interpreted in such a way that the application of Article 54 of the CISA is – other than in a case in which a penalty has been imposed – subject to an additional condition.",
                "42. In order to determine whether a decision such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a decision finally disposing of the case against a person for the purposes of Article 54 of the CISA, it is necessary, in the second place, to be satisfied that that decision was given after a determination had been made as to the merits of the case (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 March 2005 in Miraglia, C ‑ 469/03, EU:C:2005:156, paragraph 30, and 5 June 2014 in M, C ‑ 398/12, EU:C:2014:1057, paragraph 28).",
                "43. It is necessary, for that purpose, to take into account both the objective of the rules of which Article 54 of the CISA forms part and the context in which it occurs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 October 2014 in Welmory, C ‑ 605/12, EU:C:2014:2298, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).",
                "47. Therefore, the interpretation of the final nature, for the purposes of Article 54 of the CISA, of a decision in criminal proceedings in a Member State must be undertaken in the light not only of the need to ensure the free movement of persons but also of the need to promote the prevention and combating of crime within the area of freedom, security and justice.",
                "48. In view of the foregoing considerations, a decision terminating criminal proceedings, such as the decision in issue before the referring court – which was adopted in a situation in which the prosecuting authority, without a more detailed investigation having been undertaken for the purpose of gathering and examining evidence, did not proceed with the prosecution solely because the accused had refused to give a statement and the victim and a hearsay witness were living in Germany, so that it had not been possible to interview them in the course of the investigation and had therefore not been possible to verify statements made by the victim – does not constitute a decision given after a determination has been made as to the merits of the case.",

Its established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “ Engel criteria”, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge” ( see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22; A and B v.

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This does not preclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, § 53, and A and B v. Norway, cited above, § 105; see also Escoubet v. Belgium [GC], no. 26780/95, § 32, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII)."

The applicant was fined 1,000 Romanian lei (RON – approximately 250 euros (EUR) at the time) for the acts of which he was accused. That sum corresponded to the maximum fine that could be imposed under Article 91 of the Criminal Code. Although the Criminal Code designates this penalty as “administrative”, the purpose of the fine was not to repair the damage caused by the applicant but to punish him and deter him from committing further criminal acts (compare Ioan Pop v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 40301/04, § 25, 28 June 2011, where the Court found that an administrative fine of approximately EUR 50 imposed on the applicant under Ordinance no. 195/2002 for failing to stop and give way to an official vehicle was “criminal” for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention; and Sancaklı v.

Referring to statistics provided by various domestic public prosecutors ’ offices, the Government explained that the proportion of cases where decisions to discontinue or terminate criminal proceedings were set aside by the public prosecutor or judge was very low, approximately 1%.

Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (C-486/14, EU:C:2016:483), and Vladimir Turanský (C-491/07, EU:C:2008:768)), they explained that for a person to be regarded as someone whose trial had been “finally disposed of”, it was necessary, in the first place, that further prosecution had been “definitively barred”, a question which had to be assessed on the basis of the law of the Contracting State in which the criminal-law decision in issue had been taken. Next, referring to the judgments delivered by the CJEU in Filomeno Mario Miraglia (10 March 2005, C-469/03, EU:C:2005:156); M. (5 June 2014, C-398/12, EU:C:2014:1057); and Kossowski (cited above), the Government noted that the CJEU had ruled that even where, under domestic law, further prosecution had been definitively barred by a decision, that decision only qualified as “final” if it was given after a determination had been made as to the merits of the case. In the present case, the possibility for the public prosecutor ’ s office to issue an order under Article 10 (b 1 ) of the CCP without determining all the aspects of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 33 above) argued in favour of regarding the prosecutor ’ s order of 7 August 2008 as “not final”.

The reopening had been justified by a fundamental defect in the order previously issued. With reference to the Prosecutor General ’ s memorandum of 17 January 2013 (see paragraph 27 above), they explained that the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s oversight of decisions taken by public prosecutors under his or her authority pursued the aim, inter alia, of standardising the practice of public prosecutors ’ offices, particularly as regards the assessment of the degree of danger to society posed by a road traffic offence. Even though the memorandum in question had been issued after the facts of the present case, it proved that the standardisation of judicial practice had been a constant concern of the judicial authorities. Furthermore, for offences of this kind there was generally no other party with an interest in challenging the prosecutor ’ s decision to discontinue the proceedings.

Under domestic law, both the courts and the public prosecutors ’ offices had had jurisdiction to apply Articles 18 1 and 91 of the Criminal Code as in force at the material time. In order to apply those provisions, and above all to impose one of the penalties laid down in Article 91 of the Criminal Code, the authority with jurisdiction had been required to carry out a thorough investigation of the facts of the case and to assess the behaviour of the person concerned. Referring to the judgment delivered by the CJEU in Kossowski v. Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (cited above), the applicant stated that in the present case, in issuing the order of 7 August 2008, the public prosecutor ’ s office had conducted an in-depth investigation: it had interviewed the suspect and a witness and had made its own assessment of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts, before deciding on the most appropriate penalty to be imposed in this case. The detailed nature of the investigation meant that the order of 7 August 2008 should be characterised as “final”."

The higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s decision of 7 January 2009 had been contrary both to domestic law and to Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7. The applicant argued, in that connection, that the reopening had been based on a different assessment of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed, and not on the finding that the grounds forming the basis of the previous decision had never actually existed or no longer existed – as required by Article 273 of the CCP as in force at the material time – or on the emergence of new facts or a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, as required by Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7."

The “first” set of proceedings as a whole and the initial part of the “second” set of proceedings were conducted by the same authority, that is to say the public prosecutor ’ s office at the Focşani District Court, and in “both” sets of proceedings the same evidence was produced.

From a study of the two authentic versions – English and French – of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the Court notes a difference in the wording of the two texts: the French version of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 provides that the person concerned must have been “ acquitté ou condamné par un jugement ”, whereas the English version of the same provision states that the person must have been “finally acquitted or convicted”. The French version thus indicates that the acquittal or conviction must stem from a “ jugement ”, whereas the English version does not specify what form the acquittal or conviction should take. Thus confronted with versions of a law-making treaty which are equally authentic but not exactly the same, the Court must interpret them in a way that reconciles them as far as possible and is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 48, Series A no. 30, and Article 33 § 4 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)."

                "95. In view of the crucial role played by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in the Convention system and the aim of the right which it secures, the use of the word “ jugement ” in the French version of this Article cannot justify a restrictive approach to the concept of a person who has been “acquitted or convicted”. What matters in any given case is that the decision in question has been given by an authority participating in the administration of justice in the national legal system concerned, and that that authority is competent under domestic law to establish and, as appropriate, punish the unlawful behaviour of which the person has been accused. The fact that the decision does not take the form of a judgment cannot call into question the person ’ s acquittal or conviction, since such a procedural and formal aspect cannot have a bearing on the effects of the decision. Indeed, the English version of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 supports this broad interpretation of the concept. Moreover, the Court has consistently adopted a similar approach in determining the effects of a legal situation, for example in ascertaining whether proceedings defined as administrative under domestic law produced effects requiring them to be classified as “criminal” within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see, among many other authorities, A and B v. Norway, cited above, §§ 139 and 148, and Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, §§ 54-57; see also Tsonyo Tsonev v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 2376/03, § 54, 14 January 2010, where the Court proceeded from the finding that the mayor ’ s decision to impose an administrative fine on the applicant, which had not been challenged in the courts and was enforceable, had constituted a final decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7).",

Nonetheless, it has held on many occasions that the discontinuance of criminal proceedings by a public prosecutor does not amount to either a conviction or an acquittal, and that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 is therefore not applicable in such a situation (see, to that effect, Marguš, cited above, § 120, and Smirnova and Smirnova and Harutyunyan, both cited above). In Horciag (cited above) the Court stated that “a decision confirming provisional psychiatric detention cannot be treated as an acquittal for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, but concerns a preventive measure not entailing any examination or finding as to the applicant ’ s guilt (see, mutatis mutandis, Escoubet v. Belgium (cited above), and Mulot v. France ( dec. ), no. 37211/97, 14 December 1999)”."

In order to determine whether a particular decision constitutes an “acquittal” or a “conviction”, the Court has therefore considered the actual content of the decision in issue and assessed its effects on the applicant ’ s situation. Referring to the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, it considers that the deliberate choice of the words “acquitted or convicted” implies that the accused ’ s “criminal” responsibility has been established following an assessment of the circumstances of the case, in other words that there has been a determination as to the merits of the case. In order for such an assessment to take place, it is vital that the authority giving the decision is vested by domestic law with decision-making power enabling it to examine the merits of a case. The authority must then study or evaluate the evidence in the case file and assess the applicant ’ s involvement in one or all of the events prompting the intervention of the investigative bodies, for the purposes of determining whether “criminal” responsibility has been established (see, mutatis mutandis, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, § 127, ECHR 2013, a case concerning the scope of the presumption of innocence under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, in which the content, and not the form, of the decision, was the decisive factor for the Court)."

Thus, the finding that there has been an assessment of the circumstances of the case and of the accused ’ s guilt or innocence may be supported by the progress of the proceedings in a given case. Where a criminal investigation has been initiated after an accusation has been brought against the person in question, the victim has been interviewed, the evidence has been gathered and examined by the competent authority, and a reasoned decision has been given on the basis of that evidence, such factors are likely to lead to a finding that there has been a determination as to the merits of the case. Where a penalty has been ordered by the competent authority as a result of the behaviour attributed to the person concerned, it can reasonably be considered that the competent authority had conducted a prior assessment of the circumstances of the case and whether or not the behaviour of the person concerned was lawful.",

This was therefore not a simple discontinuance order, in which case Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention would no doubt have been inapplicable (see, to that effect, Marguš, cited above, § 120, and Smirnova and Smirnova and Harutyunyan, both cited above)."

Reaffirming the need to ensure observance of the principle of legal certainty, and referring to the difficulties which might arise under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 where a judicial decision was set aside as a result of an “extraordinary” remedy, the Court has only taken into account “ordinary remedies” in determining the “final” nature of a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, § 39), in the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, § 109)."

In establishing the “ordinary” remedies in a particular case, the Court will take domestic law and procedure as its starting-point. Domestic law – both substantive and procedural – must satisfy the principle of legal certainty, which requires both that the scope of a remedy for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 be clearly circumscribed in time and that the procedure for its use be clear for those parties that are permitted to avail themselves of the remedy in question. In other words, for the principle of legal certainty to be satisfied, a principle which is inherent in the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence (see Nikitin, cited above, § 39), a remedy must operate in a manner bringing clarity to the point in time when a decision becomes final. In particular, the Court observes in this context that the requirement of a time-limit in order for a remedy to be regarded as “ordinary” is implicit in the wording of the explanatory report itself, which states that a decision is irrevocable where the parties have permitted the “time-limit” to expire without availing themselves of such a remedy. A law conferring an unlimited discretion on one of the parties to make use of a specific remedy or subjecting such a remedy to conditions disclosing a major imbalance between the parties in their ability to avail themselves of it would run counter to the principle of legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Gacon v.

The Convention undoubtedly allows States, in the performance of their function as administrators of justice and guardians of the public interest, to define what, under their domestic law, constitutes a decision by which criminal proceedings are terminated with final effect. Nevertheless, if the Contracting States could determine as they saw fit when a decision was “final” for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, without scrutiny by the Court, the application of that Article would be left to their discretion. A latitude extending so far might lead to results incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Engel and Others, cited above, § 81; Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 49, Series A no. 73; and Storbråten, cited above), namely to ensure that no one is tried or punished twice for the same offence. If that right were not accompanied by a safeguard permitting the determination of the “final” decision in a particular case on the basis of objective criteria, it would be very limited in scope.

The Court observes that this remedy had a legal basis in domestic law. As regards the quality of the law governing the remedy in question, it should be noted that the text of Article 249 1 was accessible to the applicant, given that it was part of the CCP, which was itself published in the Official Gazette. Article 249 1 clearly stated that where an order discontinuing the proceedings was based on Article 10 (b 1 ) of the CCP, the individual concerned could challenge it by means of an appeal, which had to be lodged within a time-limit established by law. If no appeal had been lodged on expiry of that time-limit, the order became enforceable."

Before a decision could be taken to resume the proceedings in the latter scenario, the penalty imposed had to be set aside.

As regards the use of remedies pursuing the same aim, the law at the material time laid down different conditions according to their potential users: while the applicant had to avail himself of his remedy within twenty days, the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s office was not bound by any time-limit for reconsidering the merits of a decision. The Court acknowledges that on account of its powers and role in the proper administration of criminal justice, the prosecutor ’ s office may have been entitled to different conditions in performing its review. Nevertheless, the fact remains that on account of the lack of a time-limit, Romanian law did not regulate with sufficient clarity the manner in which that remedy was to be used, thus creating genuine uncertainty as to the applicant ’ s legal situation (see paragraph 112 above), and that this discrepancy resulted in a major imbalance between the parties in their ability to make use of the remedies in question, of such a nature as to place the applicant in a situation of legal uncertainty (see paragraph 115 in fine above)."

Consequently, the order of 7 August 2008 in which a fine was imposed on the applicant had become “final”, within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term, on the expiry of the twenty-day time-limit laid down in Article 249 1 of the CCP, by the time when the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s office exercised its discretion to reopen the criminal proceedings.",

The case-law referred to above thus indicates that the Court assesses on a case-by-case basis whether the circumstances relied upon by a higher-level authority to reopen proceedings amount to new or newly discovered facts or a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings. The concept of “fundamental defect” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 suggests that only a serious violation of a procedural rule severely undermining the integrity of the previous proceedings can serve as the basis for reopening the latter to the detriment of the accused, where he or she has been acquitted of an offence or punished for an offence less serious than that provided for by the applicable law. Consequently, in such cases, a mere reassessment of the evidence on file by the public prosecutor or the higher-level court would not fulfil that criterion. However, as regards situations where an accused has been found guilty and a reopening of proceedings might work to his advantage, the Court points out that paragraph 31 of the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7 (see paragraph 37 above) emphasises that “ this article does not prevent a reopening of the proceedings in favour of the convicted person and any other changing of the judgment to the benefit of the convicted person”. In such situations, therefore, the nature of the defect must be assessed primarily in order to ascertain whether there has been a violation of the defence rights and therefore an impediment to the proper administration of justice. Lastly, in all cases, the grounds justifying the reopening of proceedings must, according to Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 in fine, be such as to “affect the outcome of the case” either in favour of the person or to his or her detriment (see, to that effect, paragraph 30 of the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7, cited in paragraph 37 above).",

The higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s order of 7 January 2009 had the effect of entirely setting aside the previous order of 7 August 2008. This was necessary to enable the case file to be returned to the same prosecutor ’ s office, which could then continue the investigation in compliance with the orders issued, that is to say instituting criminal proceedings against the applicant and committing him for trial. Following the institution of fresh proceedings, the applicant stood trial, in the course of which the criminal charges against him were determined in a new, single decision. The present case therefore involves a system permitting the resumption of proceedings, which may be regarded as a special form of reopening for the purposes of Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, § 46, and Fadin, cited above, § 31)."

                "The high upper limits and the nature of the criminal penalty (exclusively imprisonment, excluding any kind of fine) highlight the intention of the law to severely punish anyone committing such reprehensible acts. That being the case, the administrative fine imposed on the suspect Erik Aurelian Mihalache does not fulfil the preventive aim pursued by the law.",

For a person to be regarded as someone whose trial has been ‘ finally disposed of ’ within the meaning of Article 54 of the CISA, in relation to the acts which he is alleged to have committed, it is necessary, in the first place, that further prosecution has been definitively barred (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2014 in M, C ‑ 398/12, EU:C:2014:1057, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).",

A decision which does not, under the law of the Contracting State which instituted criminal proceedings against a person, definitively bar further prosecution at national level cannot, in principle, constitute a procedural obstacle to the opening or continuation of criminal proceedings in respect of the same acts against that person in another Contracting State (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 December 2008 in Turanský, C ‑ 491/07, EU:C:2008:768, paragraph 36, and 5 June 2014 in M, C ‑ 398/12, EU:C:2014:1057, paragraphs 32 and 36).",

As regards the fact that ( i ) the decision at issue in the main proceedings was taken by the Kołobrzeg District Public Prosecutor ’ s Office in its capacity as a prosecuting authority and (ii) no penalty was enforced, neither of those factors is decisive for the purpose of ascertaining whether that decision definitively bars prosecution.",
                "39. Article 54 of the CISA is also applicable where an authority responsible for administering criminal justice in the national legal system concerned, such as the Kołobrzeg District Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, issues decisions definitively discontinuing criminal proceedings in a Member State, although such decisions are adopted without the involvement of a court and do not take the form of a judicial decision (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 February 2003 in Gözütok and Brügge, C ‑ 187/01 and C ‑ 385/01, EU:C:2003:87, paragraphs 28 and 38).",
                "40. As regards the absence of a penalty, the Court observes that it is only where a penalty has been imposed that Article 54 of the CISA lays down the condition that the penalty has been enforced, is actually in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the laws of the Contracting State of origin.",
                "41. The reference to a penalty cannot therefore be interpreted in such a way that the application of Article 54 of the CISA is – other than in a case in which a penalty has been imposed – subject to an additional condition.",
                "42. In order to determine whether a decision such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a decision finally disposing of the case against a person for the purposes of Article 54 of the CISA, it is necessary, in the second place, to be satisfied that that decision was given after a determination had been made as to the merits of the case (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 March 2005 in Miraglia, C ‑ 469/03, EU:C:2005:156, paragraph 30, and 5 June 2014 in M, C ‑ 398/12, EU:C:2014:1057, paragraph 28).",
                "43. It is necessary, for that purpose, to take into account both the objective of the rules of which Article 54 of the CISA forms part and the context in which it occurs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 October 2014 in Welmory, C ‑ 605/12, EU:C:2014:2298, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).",
                "47. Therefore, the interpretation of the final nature, for the purposes of Article 54 of the CISA, of a decision in criminal proceedings in a Member State must be undertaken in the light not only of the need to ensure the free movement of persons but also of the need to promote the prevention and combating of crime within the area of freedom, security and justice.",
                "48. In view of the foregoing considerations, a decision terminating criminal proceedings, such as the decision in issue before the referring court – which was adopted in a situation in which the prosecuting authority, without a more detailed investigation having been undertaken for the purpose of gathering and examining evidence, did not proceed with the prosecution solely because the accused had refused to give a statement and the victim and a hearsay witness were living in Germany, so that it had not been possible to interview them in the course of the investigation and had therefore not been possible to verify statements made by the victim – does not constitute a decision given after a determination has been made as to the merits of the case.",

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This does not preclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, § 53, and A and B v.

In such circumstances, the public prosecutor could decide to discontinue the prosecution and, instead of imposing the criminal penalty provided for in the definition of the offence of which the person had been accused, impose another penalty that was likewise provided for in the Criminal Code but was designated therein as “administrative”."

The provisions of the Ordinance were applicable, in accordance with Article 1 § 5, to all road users rather than to a group possessing a special status. The penalty laid down for commission of the offence defined in Article 87 § 5 of Ordinance no. 195/2002 was severe – between two and seven years ’ imprisonment – and was aimed at punishing and deterring behaviours liable to undermine the social values safeguarded by law (see paragraph 32 above)."

The Court also considers it important to note that although the acts of which the applicant was accused were not deemed to constitute a criminal offence in the order of 7 August 2008, they nevertheless fell within the scope of a provision of criminal law. The fact that the criminal acts of which the applicant was accused were initially regarded as manifestly insignificant on account of their minimal interference with one of the values safeguarded by criminal law and their specific content does not in itself preclude their classification as “criminal” within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the “ Engel criteria”, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 104, ECHR 2003-X). Moreover, in the second set of proceedings, the same acts were found to constitute a criminal offence.

In the present case, Article 87 § 5 of Ordinance no. 195/2002 provided that acts constituting the offence of refusing to give a biological sample for determining blood alcohol level were punishable by a sentence of two to seven years ’ imprisonment. Even though the public prosecutor ’ s office did not consider that the acts in issue constituted an offence for the purposes of criminal law, it was required by law to impose a penalty where the legal basis for discontinuing the proceedings was Article 18 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 33 above). The applicant was fined 1,000 Romanian lei (RON – approximately 250 euros (EUR) at the time) for the acts of which he was accused. That sum corresponded to the maximum fine that could be imposed under Article 91 of the Criminal Code. Although the Criminal Code designates this penalty as “administrative”, the purpose of the fine was not to repair the damage caused by the applicant but to punish him and deter him from committing further criminal acts (compare Ioan Pop v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 40301/04, § 25, 28 June 2011, where the Court found that an administrative fine of approximately EUR 50 imposed on the applicant under Ordinance no. 195/2002 for failing to stop and give way to an official vehicle was “criminal” for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention; and Sancaklı v. Turkey, no. 1385/07, § 30, 15 May 2018, where the Court found that a fine classified as administrative in Turkish law, amounting to approximately EUR 62, was “criminal” for the purposes of Article 6).

They emphasised that the number of cases in which the prosecutor set aside a decision proprio motu was comparable to the number in which the judge did so acting on a complaint by the interested party against the prosecutor ’ s decision. The similar frequency of the use of both these options indicated that the possibility for the higher-ranking prosecutor to reopen proceedings had to be recognised as having the same legal status as an appeal lodged by the injured party against the prosecutor ’ s decision, namely that of an ordinary remedy. Referring to statistics provided by various domestic public prosecutors ’ offices, the Government explained that the proportion of cases where decisions to discontinue or terminate criminal proceedings were set aside by the public prosecutor or judge was very low, approximately 1%. In the case of intervention by the public prosecutor leading to this outcome, the percentage was even lower, less than 0.5%."

In the instant case the higher-ranking prosecutor had intervened promptly, about five months after the order of 7 August 2008."

Armenia ( dec. ), no. 34334/04, 7 December 2006), the Government submitted that only decisions determining the merits of a case could constitute res judicata, and that the discontinuance of criminal proceedings by a public prosecutor did not amount to either a conviction or an acquittal. Under domestic law, only court decisions, and not prosecutors ’ orders, were deemed to constitute res judicata (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above)."

Referring to judgments delivered by the CJEU (for example, those delivered on 29 June 2016 and 22 December 2008 respectively in the cases of Kossowski v. Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (C-486/14, EU:C:2016:483), and Vladimir Turanský (C-491/07, EU:C:2008:768)), they explained that for a person to be regarded as someone whose trial had been “finally disposed of”, it was necessary, in the first place, that further prosecution had been “definitively barred”, a question which had to be assessed on the basis of the law of the Contracting State in which the criminal-law decision in issue had been taken. Next, referring to the judgments delivered by the CJEU in Filomeno Mario Miraglia (10 March 2005, C-469/03, EU:C:2005:156); M. (5 June 2014, C-398/12, EU:C:2014:1057); and Kossowski (cited above), the Government noted that the CJEU had ruled that even where, under domestic law, further prosecution had been definitively barred by a decision, that decision only qualified as “final” if it was given after a determination had been made as to the merits of the case. In the present case, the possibility for the public prosecutor ’ s office to issue an order under Article 10 (b 1 ) of the CCP without determining all the aspects of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 33 above) argued in favour of regarding the prosecutor ’ s order of 7 August 2008 as “not final”. Furthermore, Article 273 § 1 of the CCP had not restricted the reopening of proceedings to exceptional circumstances or made it subject to the discovery of new evidence: reopening could be ordered wherever the higher-ranking prosecutor found that the proceedings had been discontinued on non-existent factual or legal grounds."

The reopening had been justified by a fundamental defect in the order previously issued. With reference to the Prosecutor General ’ s memorandum of 17 January 2013 (see paragraph 27 above), they explained that the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s oversight of decisions taken by public prosecutors under his or her authority pursued the aim, inter alia, of standardising the practice of public prosecutors ’ offices, particularly as regards the assessment of the degree of danger to society posed by a road traffic offence. Even though the memorandum in question had been issued after the facts of the present case, it proved that the standardisation of judicial practice had been a constant concern of the judicial authorities. Furthermore, for offences of this kind there was generally no other party with an interest in challenging the prosecutor ’ s decision to discontinue the proceedings.

In support of that contention he pointed out that in both sets of proceedings he had been prosecuted for the same offence punishable under the same legislation, and that the evidence produced had been the same.

Under domestic law, both the courts and the public prosecutors ’ offices had had jurisdiction to apply Articles 18 1 and 91 of the Criminal Code as in force at the material time. In order to apply those provisions, and above all to impose one of the penalties laid down in Article 91 of the Criminal Code, the authority with jurisdiction had been required to carry out a thorough investigation of the facts of the case and to assess the behaviour of the person concerned. Referring to the judgment delivered by the CJEU in Kossowski v. Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (cited above), the applicant stated that in the present case, in issuing the order of 7 August 2008, the public prosecutor ’ s office had conducted an in-depth investigation: it had interviewed the suspect and a witness and had made its own assessment of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts, before deciding on the most appropriate penalty to be imposed in this case.

The French version thus indicates that the acquittal or conviction must stem from a “ jugement ”, whereas the English version does not specify what form the acquittal or conviction should take. Thus confronted with versions of a law-making treaty which are equally authentic but not exactly the same, the Court must interpret them in a way that reconciles them as far as possible and is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 48, Series A no. 30, and Article 33 § 4 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)."

                "95. In view of the crucial role played by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in the Convention system and the aim of the right which it secures, the use of the word “ jugement ” in the French version of this Article cannot justify a restrictive approach to the concept of a person who has been “acquitted or convicted”. What matters in any given case is that the decision in question has been given by an authority participating in the administration of justice in the national legal system concerned, and that that authority is competent under domestic law to establish and, as appropriate, punish the unlawful behaviour of which the person has been accused. The fact that the decision does not take the form of a judgment cannot call into question the person ’ s acquittal or conviction, since such a procedural and formal aspect cannot have a bearing on the effects of the decision. Indeed, the English version of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 supports this broad interpretation of the concept. Moreover, the Court has consistently adopted a similar approach in determining the effects of a legal situation, for example in ascertaining whether proceedings defined as administrative under domestic law produced effects requiring them to be classified as “criminal” within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see, among many other authorities, A and B v. Norway, cited above, §§ 139 and 148, and Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, §§ 54-57; see also Tsonyo Tsonev v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 2376/03, § 54, 14 January 2010, where the Court proceeded from the finding that the mayor ’ s decision to impose an administrative fine on the applicant, which had not been challenged in the courts and was enforceable, had constituted a final decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7).",

Nonetheless, it has held on many occasions that the discontinuance of criminal proceedings by a public prosecutor does not amount to either a conviction or an acquittal, and that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 is therefore not applicable in such a situation (see, to that effect, Marguš, cited above, § 120, and Smirnova and Smirnova and Harutyunyan, both cited above). In Horciag (cited above) the Court stated that “a decision confirming provisional psychiatric detention cannot be treated as an acquittal for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, but concerns a preventive measure not entailing any examination or finding as to the applicant ’ s guilt (see, mutatis mutandis, Escoubet v. Belgium (cited above), and Mulot v. France ( dec. ), no. 37211/97, 14 December 1999)”."

                "97. In order to determine whether a particular decision constitutes an “acquittal” or a “conviction”, the Court has therefore considered the actual content of the decision in issue and assessed its effects on the applicant ’ s situation. Referring to the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, it considers that the deliberate choice of the words “acquitted or convicted” implies that the accused ’ s “criminal” responsibility has been established following an assessment of the circumstances of the case, in other words that there has been a determination as to the merits of the case. In order for such an assessment to take place, it is vital that the authority giving the decision is vested by domestic law with decision-making power enabling it to examine the merits of a case. The authority must then study or evaluate the evidence in the case file and assess the applicant ’ s involvement in one or all of the events prompting the intervention of the investigative bodies, for the purposes of determining whether “criminal” responsibility has been established (see, mutatis mutandis, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, § 127, ECHR 2013, a case concerning the scope of the presumption of innocence under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, in which the content, and not the form, of the decision, was the decisive factor for the Court)."

Thus, the finding that there has been an assessment of the circumstances of the case and of the accused ’ s guilt or innocence may be supported by the progress of the proceedings in a given case. Where a criminal investigation has been initiated after an accusation has been brought against the person in question, the victim has been interviewed, the evidence has been gathered and examined by the competent authority, and a reasoned decision has been given on the basis of that evidence, such factors are likely to lead to a finding that there has been a determination as to the merits of the case. Where a penalty has been ordered by the competent authority as a result of the behaviour attributed to the person concerned, it can reasonably be considered that the competent authority had conducted a prior assessment of the circumstances of the case and whether or not the behaviour of the person concerned was lawful.",

This was therefore not a simple discontinuance order, in which case Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention would no doubt have been inapplicable (see, to that effect, Marguš, cited above, § 120, and Smirnova and Smirnova and Harutyunyan, both cited above)."

The prosecutor had jurisdiction to investigate the applicant ’ s alleged actions, questioning a witness and the suspect to that end. Subsequently, he applied the relevant substantive rules laid down in domestic law; he had to assess whether the requirements were fulfilled for characterising the applicant ’ s alleged acts as a criminal offence. On the basis of the evidence produced, the prosecutor carried out his own assessment of all the circumstances of the case, relating both to the applicant individually and to the specific factual situation. After carrying out that assessment, again in accordance with the powers conferred on him under domestic law, the prosecutor decided to discontinue the prosecution, while imposing a penalty on the applicant that had a punitive and deterrent purpose (see paragraphs 11 to 15 above). The penalty imposed became enforceable on the expiry of the time-limit for an appeal by the applicant under domestic law."

Remedies which the Court has designated as “extraordinary” are not taken into account in determining what was the “final” decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, §§ 37-39; Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, § 108; Sismanidis and Sitaridis v.

In that case, domestic law and the application of the criteria set out in the explanatory report led to the same outcome: the decision delivered by the Probate and Bankruptcy Court had become final in the absence of an appeal by the applicant, and thus after the expiry of the time-limit laid down in domestic law for making use of an “ordinary” remedy."

The cases of Sundqvist and Stoianova and Nedelcu centred on simple discontinuance orders, rather than decisions entailing “acquittal” or “conviction”.

A reading not only of Article 4 § 1 of Protocol No. 7 but also of paragraph 27 of the explanatory report indicates that the successive use of the expressions “the same State” and “that State” is intended to limit the application of the Article exclusively to the national level and thus to prevent any cross-border application. As regards the word “final”, the report itself provides the “definition” to be used in determining whether a decision is to be considered “final” within the meaning of Article 4 of the Protocol, with reference to an international convention, namely the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments (see paragraphs 22 and 29 of the explanatory report, cited in paragraph 37 above). In order to determine whether the decision in question is “final”, the Court must therefore ascertain, as indicated in the explanatory report, whether ordinary remedies were available against the decision or whether the parties have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of those remedies."

Reaffirming the need to ensure observance of the principle of legal certainty, and referring to the difficulties which might arise under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 where a judicial decision was set aside as a result of an “extraordinary” remedy, the Court has only taken into account “ordinary remedies” in determining the “final” nature of a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, § 39), in the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, § 109)."

Domestic law – both substantive and procedural – must satisfy the principle of legal certainty, which requires both that the scope of a remedy for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 be clearly circumscribed in time and that the procedure for its use be clear for those parties that are permitted to avail themselves of the remedy in question. In other words, for the principle of legal certainty to be satisfied, a principle which is inherent in the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence (see Nikitin, cited above, § 39), a remedy must operate in a manner bringing clarity to the point in time when a decision becomes final. In particular, the Court observes in this context that the requirement of a time-limit in order for a remedy to be regarded as “ordinary” is implicit in the wording of the explanatory report itself, which states that a decision is irrevocable where the parties have permitted the “time-limit” to expire without availing themselves of such a remedy. A law conferring an unlimited discretion on one of the parties to make use of a specific remedy or subjecting such a remedy to conditions disclosing a major imbalance between the parties in their ability to avail themselves of it would run counter to the principle of legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Gacon v.

Having regard to the foregoing, the Court considers that only the option set out in Article 249 1 of the CCP as in force at the material time constituted an “ordinary” remedy to be taken into consideration in determining the “final” decision. In the instant case, the prosecutor ’ s order of 7 August 2008 fining the applicant was subject to appeal within twenty days from the date on which the applicant was notified of it. However, the applicant did not see fit to avail himself of the remedy provided for in Article 249 1 of the CCP. Although the date on which he was notified of the order of 7 August 2008 is unknown, he nonetheless took cognisance of it, allowed the twenty-day time-limit laid down in Article 249 1 of the CCP to expire and paid the fine imposed. The applicant had no other ordinary remedy available. Consequently, the order of 7 August 2008 in which a fine was imposed on the applicant had become “final”, within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term, on the expiry of the twenty-day time-limit laid down in Article 249 1 of the CCP, by the time when the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s office exercised its discretion to reopen the criminal proceedings.",

                "127. The Court has found that the applicant was convicted in a final decision based on the order of 7 August 2008. In its order of 7 January 2009 the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s office set aside the initial prosecutor ’ s order of 7 August 2008 and the penalty imposed. Although the applicant was not punished twice for the same facts – since the initial penalty imposed on him had been set aside and he had the opportunity to secure the reimbursement of the fine – the case nevertheless involved two successive sets of criminal proceedings which concerned the same facts and were thus incompatible, on the face of it, with the first paragraph of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. Even so, such a duplication of proceedings may be compatible with Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 if the second set of proceedings involves the reopening of a case where this satisfies the requirements linked to the exception provided for in Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7."

Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention draws a clear distinction between a second prosecution or trial, which is prohibited by the first paragraph of that Article, and the resumption of a trial in exceptional circumstances, a situation referred to in its second paragraph. Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 expressly envisages the possibility that an individual may have to accept prosecution on the same charges, in accordance with domestic law, where a case is reopened following the emergence of new evidence or the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings (see Nikitin, cited above, § 45, and Kadušić, cited above, § 84). The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has also considered that the possibility of re-examining or reopening a case provides a guarantee of redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it urged member States to ensure that their national legal systems provided for appropriate procedures for re-examining or reopening cases (see Nikitin, cited above, § 56)."

The Court has already explained that circumstances relating to the case which exist during the trial, but remain hidden from the judge, and become known only after the trial, are “newly discovered”. Circumstances which concern the case but arise only after the trial are “new” (see Bulgakova v. Russia, no. 69524/01, § 39, 18 January 2007, and Vedernikova v. Russia, no. 25580/02, § 30, 12 July 2007 – as regards Article 6). The Court also considers, as is moreover noted in the explanatory report on Protocol No. 7, that the term “new or newly discovered facts” includes new evidence relating to previously existing facts (see paragraph 31 of the explanatory report, cited in paragraph 37 above)."

In some cases, the Court has also found the exception set out in Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 to be applicable in the event of the reopening of proceedings on account of a “fundamental defect in the previous proceedings”. In the case of Fadin v. Russia (no. 58079/00, § 32, 27 July 2006), for example, it held that the reopening of proceedings on the grounds that the lower-level court had not followed the instructions given to it by the Supreme Court as regards the investigative measures to be carried out had been justified by a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings and was therefore compatible with Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see also Bratyakin v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 72776/01, 9 March 2006, and Goncharovy v. Russia, no. 77989/01, 27 November 2008)."

                "133. The case-law referred to above thus indicates that the Court assesses on a case-by-case basis whether the circumstances relied upon by a higher-level authority to reopen proceedings amount to new or newly discovered facts or a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings. The concept of “fundamental defect” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 suggests that only a serious violation of a procedural rule severely undermining the integrity of the previous proceedings can serve as the basis for reopening the latter to the detriment of the accused, where he or she has been acquitted of an offence or punished for an offence less serious than that provided for by the applicable law. Consequently, in such cases, a mere reassessment of the evidence on file by the public prosecutor or the higher-level court would not fulfil that criterion. However, as regards situations where an accused has been found guilty and a reopening of proceedings might work to his advantage, the Court points out that paragraph 31 of the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7 (see paragraph 37 above) emphasises that “ this article does not prevent a reopening of the proceedings in favour of the convicted person and any other changing of the judgment to the benefit of the convicted person”. In such situations, therefore, the nature of the defect must be assessed primarily in order to ascertain whether there has been a violation of the defence rights and therefore an impediment to the proper administration of justice. Lastly, in all cases, the grounds justifying the reopening of proceedings must, according to Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 in fine, be such as to “affect the outcome of the case” either in favour of the person or to his or her detriment (see, to that effect, paragraph 30 of the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7, cited in paragraph 37 above).",

                "134. Turning to the circumstances of the case, the Court notes that the higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s order and the subsequent proceedings concerned the same accusations as those that had given rise to the proceedings resulting in the order of 7 August 2008, and that their purpose was to review whether that order was well-founded. The higher-ranking prosecutor ’ s order of 7 January 2009 had the effect of entirely setting aside the previous order of 7 August 2008. This was necessary to enable the case file to be returned to the same prosecutor ’ s office, which could then continue the investigation in compliance with the orders issued, that is to say instituting criminal proceedings against the applicant and committing him for trial. Following the institution of fresh proceedings, the applicant stood trial, in the course of which the criminal charges against him were determined in a new, single decision. The present case therefore involves a system permitting the resumption of proceedings, which may be regarded as a special form of reopening for the purposes of Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, § 46, and Fadin, cited above, § 31)."

The higher-ranking prosecutor gave his decision on the basis of the same case file as the initial prosecutor, no new evidence having been adduced and examined. The reopening of the case was therefore not justified by the emergence of new or newly discovered facts, a finding which, moreover, does not appear to be in dispute."

Conversely, the Government argued that the reopening of the criminal proceedings had been justified by a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings and had been necessary in order to ensure the standardisation of practice concerning the assessment of the seriousness of certain offences (see paragraph 76 above). However, the Court observes that that aspect was not mentioned in the order of 7 January 2009. The Prosecutor General ’ s memorandum, which was published long after the facts, contained no clear indications on how Article 18 1 of the Criminal Code should be interpreted in the context of road traffic offences. In any event, the reason put forward by the Government – the need to harmonise practice in this area – is not covered by the exceptional circumstances referred to in Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7, that is to say, the emergence of new or newly discovered facts or the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings."

The higher-ranking prosecutor also referred to the inadequacy of the penalty imposed. A fresh assessment was conducted of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant and of the penalty imposed; no mention was made of any need to remedy a breach of a procedural rule or a serious omission in the proceedings or in the investigation conducted by the initial public prosecutor ’ s office. But as pointed out above, a [mere] reassessment of the facts in the light of the applicable law does not constitute a “fundamental defect” in the previous proceedings (contrast Fadin, cited above, § 32; Bratyakin, cited above; and Goncharovy, cited above; and see, mutatis mutandis, Savinskiy v.
