The documents available indicate that the applicant was asked to give her consent in writing two and a half hours after she had been brought to hospital, when she was in the process of established labour and in a supine position. The relevant entry in the delivery record was typed and merely indicated “Patient requests sterilisation”."

In the Court’s view, such an approach is not compatible with the principles of respect for human dignity and human freedom embodied in the Convention and the requirement of informed consent laid down in the international documents to which reference is made above. In particular, it does not appear from the documents submitted that the applicant was fully informed about her health status, the proposed procedure and the alternatives to it. Furthermore, asking the applicant to consent to such an intervention while she was in labour and shortly before performing a Caesarean section clearly did not permit her to take a decision of her own free will, after consideration of all the relevant issues and, as she may have wished, after having reflected on the implications and discussed the matter with her partner."

                "113. In this context no decisive weight can be attached to the Government’s arguments concerning the history of the applicant’s pregnancies and her failure to undergo regular check-ups. According to the Government, the applicant’s sterilisation was aimed at preventing a possibly life-threatening deterioration of her health. Such a threat was not imminent as it was likely to materialise only in the event of a future pregnancy. It could also have been prevented by means of alternative, less intrusive methods. In those circumstances, the applicant’s informed consent could not be dispensed with on the basis of an assumption on the part of the hospital staff that she would act in an irresponsible manner with regard to her health in the future."

The way in which the hospital staff acted was paternalistic, since, in practice, the applicant was not offered any option but to agree to the procedure which the doctors considered appropriate in view of her situation. However, in similar situations informed consent was required, promoting autonomy of moral choice for patients."

A requirement of respect for, inter alia, women’s right to autonomy and choice in the context of health care is set out in point 31(e) of General Recommendation No. 24 adopted by CEDAW in 1999. The Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, albeit subsequent to the facts of the present case, confirms the above considerations. In particular, Article 5 calls for respect for the autonomy of persons to make decisions while taking responsibility for those decisions. Shortcomings in the domestic law and practice in this regard were acknowledged in the expert report of the Ministry of Health of 28 May 2003, which stated that medical personnel and individuals were not on an equal footing and that individuals’ rights and responsibilities in matters of health care had been limited. In this context, the applicant’s sterilisation should be considered also in the light of the requirement to respect a person’s dignity and integrity embodied in Article 1 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, which was ratified by Slovakia with effect from 1 December 1999 and was published in the Collection of Laws on 10 February 2000."

The angle under which these allegations were investigated thus rendered proof of a crime having been committed virtually impossible and the possibility for redress through the courts almost null.

The sterilisation performed on her without her full and informed consent amounted to a form of violence against women. As such it was contrary to Article 14."

The Conseil d ’ État also observed that the applicant had not argued before the Aliens Appeals Board that orders to leave the country had been issued against him, or that a removal measure could be revived; he was therefore unable to rely on those arguments in his appeal on points of law. In any event, the Conseil d ’ État held that the Aliens Appeals Board had in no way erred in finding that the examination of the medical situation of an alien facing removal whose request for leave to remain had been rejected should be carried out, as applicable, at the time of enforcement of the measure.",

This case-law concerns the application of section 9 ter, paragraph 1, to aliens who have not been excluded a priori from the scope of that provision. The change in the case-law occurred in response to a change in the practice of the Aliens Office following the introduction by an Act of 8 January 2012 of an admissibility filtering mechanism for “section 9 ter requests”, consisting in confining the application of section 9 ter to situations falling within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention as interpreted by the Court in its judgment in N. v. the United Kingdom (cited above)."

It further held that an immediate threat to life was likewise not an absolute precondition in the Court ’ s case-law for a violation of Article 3, given that other “exceptional” humanitarian circumstances within the meaning of the Court ’ s judgment in D. v. the United Kingdom (cited above) could act as a bar to removal (Aliens Appeals Board, judgments no. 92.393 of 29 November 2012 and no. 93.227 of 10 December 2012).

In judgments dated 28 November 2013 the same Division expressly found that the Aliens Appeals Board had erred in finding that Article 3 of the Convention could apply to situations other than those involving a serious, critical or terminal condition. However, that error did not mean that the Board ’ s interpretation of section 9 ter, paragraph 1, had been incorrect, as the provision in question went further than Article 3 of the Convention and covered a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment on account of the absence of appropriate treatment in the country of origin ( Conseil d ’ État, judgments nos. 225.632 and 225.633 of 28 November 2013). On 29 January 2014 the same Division specified that in so far as section 9 ter, paragraph 1, referred to a real risk to life or physical well-being, it corresponded to Article 3 of the Convention ( Conseil d ’ État, judgment no. 226.251 of 29 January 2014)."

According to that Division, the legislature had clearly sought to confine the benefit of section 9 ter to aliens who were so “seriously ill” that their removal would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, and to ensure that the assessment in question was carried out in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law as established in the case of N. v. the United Kingdom, cited above. The fact that section 9 ter covered three specific situations did not mean that its scope of application differed from that of Article 3. The three categories of illness concerned, where they attained a minimum level of severity – which had to be high – were apt to satisfy the requirements of Article 3. The Conseil d ’ État went on to quash the Aliens Appeals Board ’ s judgments of 27 November 2012 (see paragraph 102 above) on the grounds that they had unduly extended the scope of section 9 ter ( Conseil d ’ État, judgments nos. 225.522 and 225.523 of 19 November 2013)."

The second concerns aliens who risk being subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment if no appropriate treatment for their illness or condition exists in the receiving country.

Even taking into account the case-law established in N. v. the United Kingdom, according to which, in very exceptional cases concerning the expulsion of a seriously ill alien, humanitarian grounds could be invoked in order to trigger the protection of Article 3 of the Convention, the risk of deterioration in the health of a third-country national suffering from a serious illness as a result of the absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving country was not sufficient, according to the CJEU, to warrant that person being granted subsidiary protection unless the harm took the form of conduct on the part of a State or non-State third party."

In the case of Abdida (paragraphs 33 and 38-63), the CJEU held that while leave to reside on medical grounds did not come within the scope of the Qualification Directive, decisions refusing such leave were covered by Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (the “Return Directive”). As a return decision, a decision refusing leave to reside on medical grounds was subject to observance of the safeguards provided for by the Return Directive and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Article 19 § 2 of the Charter stated that no one could be removed to a State where there was a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Bearing in mind that under Article 52 § 3 of the Charter, the rights enshrined therein had, as a minimum, the same meaning and scope as the equivalent rights guaranteed by the Convention, the CJEU inferred from the case-law established in N. v. the United Kingdom that the decision to remove an alien suffering from a serious physical or mental illness to a country where the facilities for the treatment of the illness were inferior to those available in the returning State might raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention in very exceptional cases, where the humanitarian grounds against removal were compelling. Those very exceptional cases were characterised, in the CJEU ’ s view, by the seriousness and the irreparable nature of the harm that might be caused by the removal of a third-country national to a country in which there was a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. The CJEU further held that remedies in respect of a decision refusing leave to reside on medical grounds must have suspensive effect, in accordance with the Strasbourg Court ’ s case-law. This implied that provision had to be made for the applicant ’ s basic needs to be met pending a ruling on his or her appeal in accordance with the Return Directive."

The right of access to care requires inter alia that the cost of health care should be borne, at least in part, by the community as a whole (Conclusions I (1969), Statement of Interpretation on Article 11) and the cost of health care must not represent an excessively heavy burden for the individual. Out-of-pocket payments should not be the main source of funding of the health system (Conclusions 2013, Georgia).",

The first phase of the programme ensured citizens with a basic medical package, including primary health care and emergency hospitalisation. Since 1 July 2013 the programme has been expanded to include more services of primary health care and emergency hospitalisation, emergency outpatient care, planned surgeries, treatment of oncological diseases and child delivery. According to recent data (April 2014), all citizens of Georgia are now provided with basic healthcare, approximately 3.4 million people in the framework of the Universal Health Care Programme, 560,000 people are beneficiaries of the State Health Insurance Programme and about 546,000 people have a private or corporate insurance.",

State spending as a share of GDP has increased from 1.7% to 2.7% and as a share of the state budget from 5% to 9%.",

The report does not provide information on out-of-pocket payments as a share of total spending on health care, but according to WHO data it was still between 60% and 70% in 2011 (compared to about 16% on average for EU-27). Very limited coverage of medication costs is now provided under the Universal Health Care Programme, for example for emergency care, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the general lack of coverage of medication costs is a major point of dissatisfaction among beneficiaries of the programme according to a recent evaluation (Universal Healthcare (UHC) Program Evaluation by the USAID Health System Strengthening Project, April 2014). The Committee notes the examples provided by the Government of coverage of certain medication costs under the State Health Insurance Programme.",
                "The report states that as a result of deregulation measures the pharmaceutical market has become free and competitive, however no evidence is provided to show that the price of medication has become generally more accessible, especially for vulnerable groups and those with chronic conditions.",
                "While the Committee considers that the Universal Health Care Programme is a positive step forward and that the role of out-of-pocket payments as a source of funding of the health system may have been reduced somewhat, it still considers that the high proportion of out-of-pocket payments for health care, and in particular the high medication costs, represent too high a burden for the individual effectively being an obstacle to universal access to health care. The situation is therefore not in conformity with the Charter.",
                "The Committee concludes that the situation in Georgia is not in conformity with Article 11§1 of the Charter on the ground that out-of-pocket payments in general and medication costs in particular represent too high a burden for the individual effectively being an obstacle to universal access to health care.”"

He was being treated with a drug – Ibrutinib – which was very expensive, costing around EUR 6,000 per month, and the dosage of which had to be continually adjusted to his treatment for hepatitis C. The latter had recently become active again following a relapse in 2012 and 2013 and also required very expensive treatment costing EUR 700 per day. As soon as his overall condition permitted, it was planned to treat him by means of a donor transplant, at an estimated cost of EUR 150,000. This was his only hope of a cure, and the search was under way for a compatible unrelated donor.

In 2008 the Law on compulsory health insurance had been replaced by a two-tier system. People who could afford it were encouraged to take out private insurance and to avail themselves of the care provided by the hospitals that had gradually been privatised. Meanwhile, the least well-off (estimated at 20% of the population) were eligible in principle for free basic health care under a special universal insurance scheme. However, in practice, owing to an ineffective system for determining eligibility, the health-care costs of around half of the least well-off were still not covered.

The case-law demonstrated that in order for the threshold of severity required by Article 3 to be attained in such cases the extreme nature of the applicant ’ s living conditions or his or her extreme vulnerability had to be established. The circumstances contrary to human dignity had to be exceptional to such a degree that the person concerned, owing to his or her critical condition prior to removal, would inevitably be placed in a situation of intense suffering solely on account of the removal procedure and the complete absence of care and treatment in the receiving country.

According to the report of the Aliens Office ’ s medical officer of 23 June 2015, the applicant ’ s condition could not be regarded as critical, he was fit to travel, his illnesses were not directly life-threatening and none of his vital organs was in a condition that placed his life in immediate danger."

Other factors entered into the equation, such as the increase in life expectancy as a result of the medication, the feasibility of the operation, which itself depended on how the applicant ’ s general condition evolved, and the low success rate of the operation. In sum, this was a private initiative on the part of the applicant ’ s general practitioner and appeared to be a hypothetical, strategic choice linked to research considerations. It was questionable whether there was a need to ensure its continuation. As to the applicant ’ s other illnesses, it had not been possible to assess their state of advancement on the basis of the medical information provided."

The Government argued that the burden of proof in that regard depended on whether the threshold of severity defined in D. v. the United Kingdom and N. v. the United Kingdom (both cited above) was changed. If the current case-law was maintained, the disparity in the level of care between the returning State and the receiving State was relevant only if the person ’ s condition was critical at the time of his or her expulsion. If, on the other hand, it was now a question of providing evidence, not of the conditions in which the person concerned would die but of the conditions in which he or she should be kept alive, the burden of proof shifted to the living conditions in the receiving State. This shift raised a number of issues."

The applicant had not provided any detailed information on that subject. Another factor was the situation of the social welfare system in the receiving State. The assessment of that situation was, by definition, complex and general and would not allow a specific treatment to be identified. Furthermore, if the sole criterion was the prospect of survival, it had to be ascertained at what stage in the applicant ’ s treatment his expulsion should be deemed contrary to Article 3. Bearing in mind the evolving and multi-faceted nature of medical techniques, this decision was largely arbitrary. If, as the applicant had suggested, he should have been considered vulnerable and thus recognised as having victim status on account of the deterioration of his state of health, the question then arose as to what differentiated him from other Georgian nationals suffering from illness who were reliant on the Georgian health ‑ care system. It would be difficult to argue that the difference lay in his unlawful residence and his medical treatment in Belgium.

Switzerland (no. 65692/12, 14 April 2015), such assurances should be deemed to have existed in the present case and to have been sufficient. The applicant had been medically fit to travel and the local authorities would have been informed of the specific nature of his condition or would have received a list of the medication needed. No more specific guarantees had been required in the absence of any indication that the Georgian authorities would have treated the applicant less favourably than the rest of the Georgian population or that he would have been unable to obtain medical treatment that took account of the specific features of his illness. In that connection, it might have been possible to continue to treat the applicant with Ibrutinib by having his medication sent through the post under the supervision of his doctor and with the assistance of doctors in Georgia.

In the absence of any indication to that effect it should have been presumed that the Georgian authorities would comply with the requirements of the Convention.

The Court had observed the connection between a naturally occurring illness and its exacerbation by the measure for which the authorities could be held responsible. However, in N. v. the United Kingdom, while the Court had still referred to naturally occurring illness, it had not linked it to the measure taken by the authorities that would exacerbate the illness, but to the lack of sufficient resources to deal with it in the receiving country, from which it had inferred that the alleged future harm did not engage the direct responsibility of the Contracting State."

The Court had consistently acknowledged that in cases where there were serious reasons for believing that the person concerned, if removed, faced a risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3, the absolute nature of that provision prohibited the Contracting Parties from proceeding with the person ’ s removal."

Such an approach was in glaring contradiction with the case-law arising out of the judgment in Saadi v.

The parameters to be taken into consideration would be, in addition to the state of health of the persons concerned, the appropriateness or otherwise, in terms of quality and promptness, of the medical treatment available in the receiving State and whether it was actually accessible to the individuals concerned.

In the Court ’ s view, it was important to avoid upsetting the fair balance inherent in the whole of the Convention between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. A finding to the contrary would place too great a burden on States by obliging them to alleviate the disparities between their health-care system and the level of treatment available in the third country concerned through the provision of free and unlimited health care to all aliens without a right to stay within their jurisdiction (ibid., § 44). Rather, regard should be had to the fact that the applicant ’ s condition was not critical and was stable as a result of the antiretroviral treatment she had received in the United Kingdom, that she was fit to travel and that her condition was not expected to deteriorate as long as she continued to take the treatment she needed (ibid., § 47). The Court also deemed it necessary to take account of the fact that the rapidity of the deterioration which the applicant would suffer in the receiving country, and the extent to which she would be able to obtain access to medical treatment, support and care there, including help from relatives, necessarily involved a certain degree of speculation, particularly in view of the constantly evolving situation with regard to the treatment of Aids worldwide (ibid., § 50). The Court concluded that the implementation of the decision to remove the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., § 51). Nevertheless, it specified that, in addition to situations of the kind addressed in D. v. the United Kingdom in which death was imminent, there might be other very exceptional cases where the humanitarian considerations weighing against removal were equally compelling (see D. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 43).

This was a highly targeted treatment aimed at enabling him to undergo a donor transplant, which offered the last remaining prospect of a cure provided it was carried out within a fairly short timeframe.

The Aliens Appeals Board, called upon to examine the applicant ’ s requests for a stay of execution of these decisions and his applications to set them aside, held in judgments dated 28 August 2008 and 21 May 2015 that, where the administrative authority advanced grounds for exclusion, it was not necessary for it to examine the medical evidence submitted to it. With regard to the complaints based on Article 3 of the Convention, the Aliens Appeals Board further noted that the decision refusing leave to remain had not been accompanied by a removal measure, with the result that the risk of the applicant ’ s medical treatment being discontinued in the event of his return to Georgia was purely hypothetical (see paragraphs 57 and 62 above). The Conseil d ’ État, to which the applicant appealed on points of law, upheld the reasoning of the Aliens Appeals Board and specified that the medical situation of an alien who faced removal from the country and whose request for leave to remain had been refused should be assessed at the time of enforcement of the removal measure rather than at the time of its adoption (see paragraph 64 above)."

The solution advocated by the Chamber, which would have entailed the family moving to Georgia for long enough to take care of the applicant until his death, would not have been feasible as it would have meant taking the children out of school in Belgium and taking them to a country they did not know and where they did not speak the language.

Firstly, it is not disputed that family life existed between the applicant, his wife and the children born in Belgium. This renders irrelevant the disagreement as to whether the applicant was the father of the child born before their arrival in Belgium, who is now an adult (ibid., § 136). Furthermore, assuming that the removal measure could have been examined from the standpoint of the applicant ’ s private life, the “family life” aspect should take precedence in view of the specific issues raised by the present case and the parties ’ submissions. Secondly, while the case concerns both the domestic authorities ’ refusal to grant the applicant leave to remain in Belgium and the threat of his removal to Georgia, in view of the specific features of the case and recent developments the Chamber found that the key question was whether the Belgian authorities were under a duty to allow the applicant to reside in Belgium so that he could remain with his family (ibid., § 138). The Grand Chamber considers that examining the complaint alleging a violation of Article 8 in this way from the standpoint of the Belgian authorities ’ positive obligations is made all the more necessary by the developments in the case, in particular the deterioration of the applicant ’ s health and his eventual death. Lastly, the Grand Chamber reiterates that in the context of both its positive and its negative obligations, the State must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of society as a whole, and that the extent of the State ’ s obligations will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (ibid., § 140, and the references cited therein)."

To recapitulate, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified."

The rights and obligations of police officers had a distinctly “public” rather than a “civil” aspect for the purposes of Article 6. The alleged fact that the applicants ’ pecuniary interests were at stake did not suffice to bring the proceedings within the ambit of Article 6 since “proceedings do not become ‘ civil ’ merely because they also raise an economic issue” (see Pierre-Bloch v.

In their view the proceedings had begun on 25 April 1997 when the applicants had lodged their application with the County Administrative Court and had ended on 27 April 2000 with the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s decision. The case had not been complex; the County Administrative Board had stayed the proceedings partly because it had wished to wait for the outcome of the Askola case with a view to treating personnel from different police districts in an equal manner, although the matter had already been decided in respect of the applicants. The fact that it had taken the County Administrative Board four years to examine the applicants ’ request could not be taken into account, as that procedure had not amounted to court proceedings and was thus not relevant in calculating the length of the proceedings. The case had not involved basic subsistence and had not therefore, or on any other ground, been particularly urgent. There had been efforts to resolve the case by way of negotiation between 3 July 1991 and 19 March 1993. During the negotiations the applicants had been informed that a wage supplement could only be granted if the Supreme Administrative Court amended the decision of the lower court in the Askola case."

The applicants had been given an opportunity to provide additional written observations. The issue at stake had been technical and based on the relevant documents.

Sweden, 27 October 1987, § 31, Series A no. 125 ‑ A ), the dispute over a “right”, which can be said at least on arguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law, must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question."

Nor did the national courts dismiss the applicants ’ claims as lacking any basis. While it is true that their claims were rejected, the Administrative Courts may be regarded as having examined the merits of the application and in so doing they determined the dispute over their rights. The Court considers that against such a background the applicants could claim to have a right on arguable grounds (see, inter alia, Neves e Silva v.

Secondly, the Court has examined the Government ’ s argument, relying on Pellegrin (cited above), that Article 6 is not applicable since disputes raised by servants of the State such as police officers over their conditions of service are excluded from its ambit. The present case concerns proceedings in which it was determined whether the first five applicants, and the late Mr Hannu Matti Lappalainen, who were civil servants, were entitled to receive a wage supplement. In order to determine this question, the Court must note the background to and the ratio of the judgment in Pellegrin and how this has been applied in practice in subsequent cases."

Before the judgment in Pellegrin, the Court had held that disputes relating to the recruitment, careers and termination of service of civil servants were as a general rule outside the scope of Article 6 § 1. That general principle of exclusion had however been limited and clarified in a number of judgments. For example, in Francesco Lombardo v. Italy ( 26 November 1992, § 17, Series A no. 249 ‑ B ) and Massa v. Italy ( 24 August 1993, § 26, Series A no. 265 ‑ B ) the Court had considered that the applicants ’ complaints related neither to the “recruitment” nor to the “careers” of civil servants and only indirectly to “termination of service” as they consisted in claims for purely pecuniary rights arising in law after termination of service. In those circumstances and in view of the fact that the Italian State was not using “discretionary powers” in performing its obligation to pay the pensions in issue and could be compared to an employer who was a party to a contract of employment governed by private law, the Court had held that the applicants ’ claims were “ civil ” in nature within the meaning of Article 6 § 1."

France ( 17 March 1997, § 44, Reports 1997 ‑ II ) the decision contested by the applicant, namely the refusal to reinstate her to a permanent post in the civil service, had been held by the Court to concern “her ‘ recruitment ’, her ‘ career ’ and the ‘ termination of [her] service ’ ”. Nor did the applicant ’ s claim for payment of the salary she would have received if she had been reinstated render Article 6 § 1 applicable, as an award of such compensation by the administrative court was “directly dependent on a prior finding that the refusal to reinstate [had been] unlawful”. The Court had accordingly decided that the dispute did not concern a “civil” right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1."

Italy, 2 September 1997, § 18, Reports 1997-V ) and did not mainly call in question “the authorities ’ discretionary powers” (see Benkessiouer v. France and Couez v.

When the Court came to review the situation in Pellegrin (§ 60), it considered that the above -mentioned case-law contained a degree of uncertainty for Contracting States as to the scope of their obligations under Article 6 § 1 in disputes raised by employees in the public sector over their conditions of service. The Court sought to put an end to that uncertainty by establishing an autonomous interpretation of the term “civil service” which would make it possible to afford equal treatment to public servants performing equivalent or similar duties in the States Parties to the Convention, irrespective of the domestic system of employment and, in particular, whatever the nature of the legal relation between the official and the administrative authority."

            [
                "47. To that end the Court introduced a functional criterion based on the nature of the employee ’ s duties and responsibilities. The holders of posts involving responsibilities in the general interest or participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law wielded a portion of the State ’ s sovereign power. The State therefore had a legitimate interest in requiring of these officials a special bond of trust and loyalty. On the other hand, in respect of other posts which did not have this “public administration” aspect, there was no such interest (see Pellegrin, cited above, § 65). The Court therefore ruled that the only disputes excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 were those which were raised by public servants whose duties typified the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter was acting as the depositary of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities. A manifest example of such activities was provided by the armed forces and the police ( § 66 ). It concluded that no disputes between administrative authorities and employees who occupied posts involving participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law attracted the application of Article 6 § 1 (§ 67)."

                "48. The Court observes that Pellegrin was categorical in its wording; where the post belonged to the said category, all disputes were excluded from Article 6 irrespective of their nature. It allowed only one exception: disputes concerning pensions all came within the ambit of Article 6 § 1 because, on retirement, the special bond between the employees and the authorities was broken; the employees then found themselves in a situation exactly comparable to that of employees under private law in that the special relationship of trust and loyalty binding them to the State had ceased to exist and the employee could no longer wield a portion of the State ’ s sovereign power (see Pellegrin, cited above, § 67)."

It is important to note that the Court emphasised that in applying a functional criterion it must adopt a restrictive interpretation, in accordance with the object and purpose of the Convention, of the exceptions to the safeguards afforded by Article 6 § 1 (§ § 64 - 6 7 ). This was to limit the cases in which public servants could be denied the practical and effective protection afforded to them (as confirmed in Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 40, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII ).",

            [
                "50. The judgment in Pellegrin, which is the most recent significant link in the chain of development of the case-law, was intended to provide a workable concept by which it was to be ascertained, on a case - by - case basis, whether the applicant ’ s post entailed – in the light of the nature of the duties and responsibilities appertaining to it – direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities. It then had to be determined whether the applicant, in the framework of one of these categories of posts, did indeed exercise functions which could be characterised as falling within the exercise of public power, that is, whether the applicant ’ s position within the State hierarchy was sufficiently important or elevated to speak of a participation in wielding State power."
            ],
            [
                "51. The present case, however, highlights that the application of the functional criterion may itself lead to anomalous results. At the material time the applicants were employed by the Ministry of the Interior. Five of them were employed as police officers, which typifies the specific activities of the public service as defined above. This entailed participating directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and the performance of duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State. The functions of the office - assistant applicant were purely administrative, without any decision - making competence or other exercise directly or indirectly of public power. Her functions were thus not distinguishable from any other office assistant in public or private employment. As noted above, Pellegrin expressly mentioned the police as a manifest example of activities belonging to the exercise of public authority, thus excluding a whole category of persons from the scope of Article 6. On a strict application of the Pellegrin approach it would appear that the office- assistant applicant in the present case would enjoy the guarantees of Article 6 § 1, whereas there is no doubt that the police- officer applicants would not. This would be so irrespective of the fact that the dispute was identical for all the applicants."
            ],
            [
                "52. Further, an examination of the cases decided since Pellegrin shows that ascertaining the nature and status of the applicant ’ s functions has not been an easy task; nor has the category of public service in which the applicant works always been clearly distinguishable on the basis of his or her actual role. In some cases it has not been apparent the extent to which inclusion in a particular sector of public service was sufficient to remove the applicability of Article 6 without consideration of the nature of the individual ’ s responsibilities.",
                "For example, in Kępka v. Poland ( ( dec .), nos. 31439/96 and 35123/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX ) the Court found that, although the applicant, unfit for fire - fighting duties, worked throughout his career in the national fire service as a lecturer, his duties, which involved research and access to information of a sensitive nature, had to be regarded as falling within the sphere of national defence, in which the State exercised sovereign power, and as having entailed, at least indirectly, participation in the performance of duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State ( contrast Frydlender, cited above, § 39). Accordingly, Article 6 was inapplicable. By way of further example, in Kanayev v. Russia ( no. 43726/02, § 18, 27 July 2006 ), where the applicant was an active officer of the Russian navy, a third - rank captain, and thus in that capacity “wielded a portion of the State ’ s sovereign power”, Article 6 § 1 was held not to apply, even though the dispute related to non-enforcement of a court judgment in his favour which related to disputed travel expenses. In Verešová ( cited above ), Article 6 § 1 was excluded in respect of a lawyer working for the police on the basis of the nature of the functions and responsibilities of the police service as a whole, without any apparent consideration of her own individual role in the organisation."

            [
                "53. Furthermore, it is particularly striking that, taken literally, the “ functional approach ” requires that Article 6 be excluded from application to disputes where the position of the applicant as a State official does not differ from the position of any other litigant, or, in other words, where the dispute between the employee and the employer is not especially marked by a “ special bond of trust and loyalty ”."

                "54. That it was the applicant ’ s position and not the nature of the dispute which was decisive was, however, confirmed in Martinie v. France ( [GC], no. 58675/00, § 30, ECHR 2006-VI ) where the Grand Chamber concluded that Article 6 § 1 was applicable, as the Chamber had done ( admissibility decision of 13 January 2004), but on the basis of different reasoning. It had regard to the fact that the applicant was a civil servant who worked as an accountant for a school, without any participation in the exercise of public powers, whereas the Chamber had mainly had regard to the nature of the dispute between the applicant and the State, namely his liability to repay unauthorised payments, in reaching the conclusion that the obligations of the applicant were “civil” ones within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, with private-law features predominating in this case."

Pellegrin should be understood against the background of the Court ’ s previous case-law and as constituting a first step away from the previous principle of inapplicability of Article 6 to the civil service, towards partial applicability. It reflected the basic premise that certain civil servants, because of their functions, are bound by a special bond of trust and loyalty towards their employer. However, it is evident from the cases decided since that in very many Contracting States access to a court is accorded to civil servants, allowing them to bring claims for salary and allowances, even dismissal or recruitment, on a similar basis to employees in the private sector. The domestic system, in such circumstances, perceives no conflict between the vital interests of the State and the right of the individual to protection. Indeed, while neither the Convention nor its Protocols guarantee a right of recruitment to the civil service, it does not follow that in other respects civil servants fall outside the scope of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 19 85, § 60, Series A no. 94, and Glasenapp v.

As a general rule, the guarantees in the Convention extend to civil servants (see, mutatis mutandis, Schmidt and Dahlström v.

In the present case, where the applicants, police officers and administrative assistant alike had, according to the national legislation, the right to have their claims for allowances examined by a tribunal, no ground related to the effective functioning of the State or any other public necessity has been advanced which might require the removal of Convention protection against unfair or lengthy proceedings."

However, the Court would observe that the Luxembourg Court itself applies a wider approach in favour of judicial control, as shown by its landmark judgment in Marguerite Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( Case 222/84, § 18, [ 1986 ] ECR 1651 ) brought by a female police officer on the basis of the Directive on non-discrimination. The Luxembourg Court reasoned:",
                "“The requirement of judicial control stipulated [in Article 6 of Council Directive no. 76/207] reflects a general principle of law which underlies the constitutional traditions common to the Member States. That principle is also laid down in Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950. As the European Parliament, Council and Commission recognised in their Joint Declaration of 5 April 1977 ... and as the Court has recognised in its decisions, the principles on which that Convention is based must be taken into consideration in Community law. ”",

If an individual can rely on a material right guaranteed by Community law, his or her status as a holder of public power does not render the requirements of judicial control inapplicable. Moreover, the broad scope of the effective judicial control has been emphasised by the Luxembourg Court ’ s reference to both Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention (see the Marguerite Johnston case, cited above, and the case of Panayotova and Others v. Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie, Case C ‑ 327/02, [2004] ECR I- 11055, § 27), as well as by the Charter on Fundamental Rights (see above, §§ 29-30)."

However, it is primarily for the Contracting States, in particular the competent national legislature, not the Court, to identify expressly those areas of public service involving the exercise of the discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty where the interests of the individual must give way. The Court exerts its supervisory role subject to the principle of subsidiarity (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 103, ECHR 2001 ‑ V ). If a domestic system bars access to a court, the Court will verify that the dispute is indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6. If it does not, then there is no issue and Article 6 § 1 will apply.",
                "It should be emphasised, however, that this situation is distinct from other cases, which due to the claims being made are regarded as falling outside the civil and criminal heads of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, inter alia, for the assessment of tax, Ferrazzini v. Italy ( [GC], no. 44759/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII ); for matters of asylum, nationality and residence in a country, Maaouia v.

To recapitulate, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified."

It thus took it four years to examine the case.

As to the length of the proceedings, the applicants had had an effective remedy, as proved by the fact that one of the applicants lodged a successful complaint with the Chancellor of Justice, who drew the Board ’ s attention to tardiness in the proceedings.

The scope of the Contracting States ’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” both in law and in practice (see, among other authorities, Kudła v.

Indeed, it appears that the Chancellor ’ s decision of 24 January 1997 may have had an impact on the County Administrative Board, which rendered its decision in March 1997. However, by the time the Chancellor of Justice took measures, the applicants had been awaiting a decision for nearly four years. The Court finds that although the Chancellor ’ s intervention and its positive effect in the present case must be acknowledged, a complaint to the Chancellor ’ s Office does not meet the standard of “effectiveness” for the purposes of Article 13.

This had been in accordance with the State Administration ’ s practice to the effect that acquired advantages should not be lost, which was demonstrated by subsequent directions ( introduced in 2003 ) for the application of the pay system.

As to the allegation that the applicants had been treated differently from other personnel, the Government explained that, pursuant to a collective agreement, civil servants working in Sonkajärvi had been entitled to a remote-area allowance. By a subsequent collective agreement, in force until 29 February 1992, the remote-area allowance had been replaced by a cold-area allowance and certain municipalities, including Sonkajärvi, had been removed from the group for which this allowance was to be paid. The loss of the wage supplement was based on a provision in the implementing instruction for the collective agreement, according to which it was paid only as long as the person concerned served in the municipality where the entitlement to the supplement was given. If the duty station changed, temporarily or permanently, the payment of the supplement ceased. As to the Nurmes case, in which a wage supplement had been granted because of a reduction in the cold - area allowance grading, it was not comparable to the applicants ’ case. A clearly negative position concerning compensation for the longer commute was taken by the Ministry of Finance in the Sonkajärvi and Askola cases ( decisions of 3 July 1991) and in the subsequent court proceedings, which in both cases resulted in a negative decision by the Supreme Administrative Court. The Ministry of the Interior had only applied for a wage supplement on the basis of increased costs arising from the longer commute for ten persons, including the applicants, referring to earlier practice applied by the Ministry of Finance in the Mäntyharju case. Thus, the Ministry of the Interior did not lodge the application on the basis of the loss of the wage supplement arising from the removal of the remote - area allowance. Accordingly, the applicants ’ case was entirely comparable with the Askola case. In fact, where police districts had been incorporated after 3 July 1991, the practice had been not to award compensation in cases comparable to that of the applicants."

The only reason for him disclosing them was to help fight corruption and trading in influence. He disagreed that the purpose of Mr Mişin ’ s note had simply been to pass the police officers ’ letter to the Prosecutor General in accordance with the Petitions Act (see paragraph 38 above) and with the contention that Mr Mişin ’ s actions had been in accordance with sections 22 and 23 of the Status of Members of Parliament Act (see paragraph 39 above).

The independence of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office was guaranteed in theory but not in practice. In the applicant ’ s submission, the Prosecutor General could be dismissed at will by Parliament without any reasons being given. In the years 2002-03 more than thirty prosecutors who were not considered loyal to the Communist Party had been dismissed. Moreover, Mr Mişin, who was one of the leaders of the ruling party and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, was also perceived as systematically using his position to influence the outcome of judicial proceedings.",

Such conduct constituted an offence under Article 190 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 33 above). The applicant also pointed to the fact that, after receiving the letter in question, the Prosecutor General had ordered the reopening of the criminal investigation and shortly thereafter the criminal proceedings had been discontinued. According to the applicant, the fact that the four police officers decided to ask State representatives at the highest level to investigate the legality of the criminal charges against them indicated the existence of a practice in the Republic of Moldova that was contrary to the principle of the separation of powers. It was highly unlikely that police officers dealing with the investigation of crime would be unaware that the authorities to whom they had addressed their letters had no judicial functions.",

It would have been pointless to bring the problem to the attention of the Prosecutor General as he lacked independence. Even though he had been aware of Mr Mişin ’ s letter for about six months, it would appear that he had simply concealed its existence while at the same time complying with its terms. The refusal of the Prosecutor ’ s Office to initiate criminal proceedings against Mr Mişin after the publication of the newspaper articles (see paragraphs 15 and 29 above) supported the view that any disclosure to the Prosecutor ’ s Office would have been in vain. Furthermore, the applicant had had reasonable grounds for fearing that the evidence would be concealed or destroyed if he disclosed it to his superiors.",

Mr Mişin had simply passed the letter received from the four police officers to the competent body – the Prosecutor General ’ s Office – in accordance with the Petitions Act (see paragraph 38 above) and the Status of Members of Parliament Act (see paragraph 39 above).

            [
                "69. The central issue which falls to be determined is whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. The fundamental principles in that regard are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have been summed up as follows (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, cited above, § 31; Hertel v. Switzerland, 25 August 1998, § 46, Reports 1998 ‑ VI; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 87, ECHR 2005 ‑ II):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "70. The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace, and that civil servants, such as the applicant, enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 52 above). At the same time, the Court is mindful that employees have a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion to their employer. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002)."
            ],
            [
                "71. Since the mission of civil servants in a democratic society is to assist the government in discharging its functions and since the public has a right to expect that they will help and not hinder the democratically elected government, the duty of loyalty and reserve assumes special significance for them (see, mutatis mutandis, Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 53. ) In addition, in view of the very nature of their position, civil servants often have access to information which the government, for various legitimate reasons, may have an interest in keeping confidential or secret. Therefore, the duty of discretion owed by civil servants will also generally be a strong one."
            ],
            [
                "72. To date, however, the Court has not had to deal with cases where a civil servant publicly disclosed internal information. To that extent the present case raises a new issue which can be distinguished from that raised in Stoll v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 69698/01, ECHR 2007-V ), where the disclosure took place without the intervention of a civil servant. In this respect the Court notes that a civil servant, in the course of his work, may become aware of in-house information, including secret information, whose divulgation or publication corresponds to a strong public interest. The Court thus considers that the signalling by a civil servant or an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should, in certain circumstances, enjoy protection. This may be called for where the employee or civil servant concerned is the only person, or part of a small category of persons, aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large. In this context, the Court has had regard to the following statement from the Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe ’ s Civil Law Convention on Corruption (see paragraph 46 above):",
                "“In practice corruption cases are difficult to detect and investigate and employees or colleagues (whether public or private) of the persons involved are often the first persons who find out or suspect that something is wrong .”"

            [
                "73. In the light of the duty of discretion referred to above, disclosure should be made in the first place to the person ’ s superior or other competent authority or body. It is only where this is clearly impracticable that the information could, as a last resort, be disclosed to the public (see, mutatis mutandis, Haseldine, cited above). In assessing whether the restriction on freedom of expression was proportionate, therefore, the Court must take into account whether there was available to the applicant any other effective means of remedying the wrongdoing which he intended to uncover."

            [
                "74. In determining the proportionality of an interference with a civil servant ’ s freedom of expression in such a case, the Court must also have regard to a number of other factors. In the first place, particular attention shall be paid to the public interest involved in the disclosed information. The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see, among other authorities, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV). In a democratic system, the acts or omissions of government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of the media and public opinion. The interest which the public may have in particular information can sometimes be so strong as to override even a legally imposed duty of confidence (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, and Radio Twist, a.s. v. Slovakia, no. 62202/00, ECHR 2006-XV )."
            ],
            [
                "75. The second factor relevant to this balancing exercise is the authenticity of the information disclosed. It is open to the competent State authorities to adopt measures intended to react appropriately and without excess to defamatory accusations devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 46, Series A no. 236 ). Moreover, freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify, to the extent permitted by the circumstances, that it is accurate and reliable (see, mutatis mutandis, Morissens v. Belgium, no. 11389/85, Commission decision of 3 May 1988, DR 56, p. 127, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ III )."
            ],
            [
                "76. On the other side of the scales, the Court must weigh the damage, if any, suffered by the public authority as a result of the disclosure in question and assess whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed (see, mutatis mutandis, Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16 December 1992, § 45, Series A no. 252, and Stoll, cited above, § 130).

This sanction not only had negative repercussions on the applicant ’ s career but it could also have a serious chilling effect on other employees from the Prosecutor ’ s Office and discourage them from reporting any misconduct.

The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",

As regards “voluntary offer”, the ILO supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including: the form and subject matter of consent; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion; and the possibility of revoking freely-given consent. Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.”",

These factors help distinguish between “forced labour” and a helping hand which can reasonably be expected of other family members or people sharing accommodation. Along these lines, in the case of Van der Mussele v.

In addition, the Government explained that the rule according to which a civil party could appeal on points of law only in respect of his civil interests did not prevent the Court of Cassation from verifying the conformity with the law of the judgment given by the Court of Appeal in the criminal proceedings. The civil part of the proceedings was contingent on the outcome of the criminal proceedings. In the present case the Court of Cassation had considered that the Court of Appeal had found, without any inadequacy, contradiction or infringement of the law, that proof of the offence had not been established.",

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State or in terms of interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 144, ECHR 2004 - V, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, §§ 98 et seq., ECHR 2003-VIII).",

Sweden, 6 February 19 7 6, § 39, Series A no. 20; Gustafsson, cited above, § 45; Schettini and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 29529/95, 9 November 2000; and Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, cited above, § 44). Thus, the Court has so far not found fault with a Contracting State's failure to impose on an employer an obligation to recognise a trade union or to provide for a system of compulsory collective bargaining (see Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, § 44, and cases cited therein).",
                "However, where the domestic law of a Contracting State permits the conclusion of closed-shop agreements between unions and employers which run counter to the freedom of choice of the individual inherent in Article 11, the margin of appreciation must be considered reduced. The Court reiterates in this connection that, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 112- 13). In assessing whether a Contracting State has remained within its margin of appreciation in tolerating the existence of closed-shop agreements, particular weight must be attached to the justifications advanced by the authorities for them and, in any given case, the extent to which they impinge on the rights and interests protected by Article 11. Account must also be taken of changing perceptions of the relevance of closed-shop agreements for securing the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom.",

The Court found it of importance that obligatory membership of the association was imposed on him by law and that there was no duty to join the association when Sigurður A. Sigurjόnsson obtained his taxi licence as the original requirement to do so lacked a legal basis. As in the British Rail judgment, the Court emphasised that it did not decide on the scope of Article 11 of the Convention in relation to the negative freedom of association.",

                "The Agreement laid down five major principles:",
                "( 1 ) the right of employees to organise within trade unions;",
                "( 2 ) the right of employers to manage and control work;",
                "( 3 ) the right to industrial action (strikes, boycotts and lockouts) in order to obtain, for example, a collective agreement;",
                "( 4 ) the embargo on industrial action, which means that no strikes are lawful during the term of a collective agreement; and",
                "( 5 ) the establishment of a special arbitration tribunal to deal with all violations of the September Agreement.",
                "The September Agreement is unique in that it has formed the basis of all subsequent general agreements between management and labour. Traditionally, the Danish legislature plays a minor role as regards the conditions governing wages, salaries and employment. Therefore, only to a certain extent does the Danish labour market have legislation which does not emanate from European Union directives, examples being the Salaried Employees'Act ( Funktionærloven ) and the Holiday Act ( Ferieloven ). Accordingly, rights imposed by statute in other countries have in Denmark been obtained by means of agreements between the labour - market partners. It is thus a characteristic feature of Danish law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements (collective and individual), labour-law principles, general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes. More than 80 % of all employees in Denmark are trade union members.",
                "From figures provided by Statistics Denmark ( Danmarks Statistikbank ) and the Ministry of Employment ( Beskæftigelsesministeriet ), in 2001 the Danish workforce consisted of 2,799,958 persons (inclusive of the unemployed). Of these, 1,611,715 were employed within the private sector and 937,826 within the public sector.",
                "The Government estimate that nearly 80 % of all employees are covered by collective agreements. It appears that the applicants disagree with this estimation.",
                "The institution of closed-shop agreements is a long-standing practice in Denmark. Typically, a closed-shop agreement states that an employer has undertaken to hire and employ only members of the trade union that is party to the collective agreement concluded by the employer. Closed-shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market as they would be in conflict with the principle of equality under Danish administrative law. Also, they are not concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and LO, because DA considers the use of closed-shop provisions to be an interference with employers'managerial rights. Thus, closed-shop agreements are mainly of importance in collective agreements concluded with employers not affiliated to an employers'organisation.",
                "The precise number of employees covered by closed-shop agreements is unknown. However, from figures provided by DA and the Christian Trade Union, the Government estimate that approximately 220,000 wage earners are affected in some way by closed-shop agreements – that is, less than 10 % of all Danish employees on the labour market. The applicants submit that this estimation is probably somewhat below the actual figure.",

The mandate of the committee was to examine the scope of such clauses and other circumstances which required membership of specific associations as a precondition for access to certain professions, and also to assess the compliance of such clauses with Denmark's international commitments. The committee was also asked to draw up recommendations and proposals for initiatives which afforded greater protection of the negative right to freedom of association. The committee submitted a report in June 2002 ( Betænkning nr. 1419, Udvalget om eksklusivbestemmelser ) which proposed changes to the law concerning closed-shop agreements between employees'organisations and employers. The committee pointed out that general developments in society and the labour market could no longer justify, to the same extent as before, the need for closed-shop agreements, since strong and representative trade unions and organisations had now been established on the labour market. The committee further stated that the advantages relating to membership of a trade union should in themselves be strong enough reasons to be a member of a trade union. The committee considered that as closed-shop agreements only existed for a small part of the labour market, a change in the law would have only a marginal impact upon union density rates. The committee further stated that closed-shop agreements could have the effect of reducing the supply of labour, that freedom of contract on the labour market was not an immutable concept, and that restrictions existed in several fields as to the agreements that management and labour could lawfully conclude."

However, this does not mean that no business within the scope of DA has any collective ‑ bargaining agreement containing closed ‑ shop provisions. Thus, it is estimated by DA that at least 45,000 employees working in businesses organised in member organisations of DA are covered by closed ‑ shop provisions.",

The same principle applies when members of the member organisations enter into collective ‑ bargaining agreements themselves.

DA does not approve of collective ‑ bargaining agreements which contain exclusivity clauses.",

The Employers'Association of Agriculture and Forestry said that the whole market garden area is covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and argued for changes in all negotiations for collective- bargaining agreements. SID consistently states that there is no price at which the clauses could be eliminated from collective ‑ bargaining agreements, so the question is not open to negotiation. In the market garden area the exclusivity agreements result in a decrease in the number of applicants for apprenticeships, recruitment problems and problems in hiring seasonal workers. In other areas within agriculture and forestry it is also the case that exclusivity agreements are not'for sale'.",

At the first reading, the bill is discussed in general and thereafter, normally, the bill is referred to a committee, which examines the proposal and is free to put questions to the relevant minister. With regard to the bill in question, on 6 February 2003 the Parliamentary Committee on Employment ( Arbejdsmarkedsudvalget ) submitted various questions to the Minister for Employment.

                "“The Minister is requested to explain the impact of the proposed bill in relation to the scope for trade unions to enforce collective ‑ bargaining agreements, especially in relation to non-organised employers. It appears from the annual reports of the Labour Court for the years 1999 and 2000 that during the years in question, 600 and 646 cases respectively were conducted against non-organised employers, which correspond to 77% and 82% respectively of the cases in the Labour Court instigated by employees in those years. All these cases were instigated by LO ... It is the opinion of LO that the removal of closed - shop provisions will to a large extent make the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements against such employers more difficult. ”",
                "“I find it difficult to see how the annulment of closed - shop provisions in collective ‑ bargaining agreements with non-organised employers, which is estimated to cover around 120,000 employees, should make it more difficult for the organisations to secure the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements. First and foremost the annulment of a closed - shop provision in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement with a non-organised employer would not change the fact that the collective ‑ bargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with. That means that the employees or their representatives would still have the possibility of bringing to the attention of the union in question any problems in getting the agreement complied with. The possibilities for the trade union to take action in such a case would therefore be unaffected. If there is a problem in having the terms in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement complied with in a business, due to the fact that the trade union does not have any members in that business, that should be reason enough for the employees to join the trade union and get the trade union to complain of the lack of compliance.",
                "I do not believe that a trade union will get much help in enforcing a collective ‑ bargaining agreement from employees whose membership is not voluntary.",
                "I do believe that if a trade union makes an effort and spreads the message to all the employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement that it is due to its efforts that there are orderly conditions in the business, some of those employees that are involuntary members today could become voluntary members, and all employees could then stand together to secure compliance with the collective- bargaining agreement. ”",
                "“Under Danish collective- labour law, an employer must comply with the terms of a collective agreement in respect of all employees doing work within the field of the collective-bargaining agreement. Does the Minister believe that it is fair that non ‑ organised employees should, in this way, enjoy benefits to which they have not contributed, and which have been obtained for them by the trade unions?”",
                "“ The principle that a collective ‑ bargaining agreement also applies in relation to the work performed by non-organised employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement, is a principle which also applies to areas without closed ‑ shop provisions. It is a principle which follows from collective ‑ bargaining agreements themselves, and it is only the organisation which is a party to the collective ‑ bargaining agreement which may raise a claim, not the individual (non-organised) employee.",

                "● It is difficult to get an inflow of apprentices to the trade. We need around 500 apprentices per year, but can only attract around 200. The closed - shop provision scares away young people. At the same time we have difficulty in securing qualified labour, since many capable employees do not want to work under an exclusivity agreement. Some of these may then try to circumvent the provision by establishing a relationship as a sub-contractor instead of as an actual employee.",
                "● The business of market gardening is characterised by seasonal work. Every year we need summer holiday casual workers, workers to pick vegetables, workers for Christmas production and the like. Typically, we are speaking of young students who would like to work for a few months – until the closed ‑ shop provision is mentioned.",
                "● Danish market gardens are in a very tough competitive situation in the European Union. No other country in the Union has closed - shop provisions similar to those for Danish gardeners. Therefore, there is unequal competition at European Union level.",
                "● Closed ‑ shop provisions may be an instrument for securing wages and employment terms in small, non-organised businesses. Danish market gardens are very large businesses (20-250 employees per business) and more than 90% are organised. The closed - shop provision has therefore been overtaken by the structural development of the business. In relation to businesses under the DA, the trade union movement accepts that the closed ‑ shop provisions are unnecessary; see the article in SID's periodical.",
                "● Danish market gardens are organised, from a business point of view, in the same way as Danish agriculture. The businesses in agriculture are not covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and Danish market gardens should not be either.",
                "● The closed ‑ shop agreement with SID causes daily problems with employees who are members of other trade unions or who wish to join other unions. For example, it frustrates the desire of employees to be transferred to the Danish Association for Managers and Executives, to an organisation of artisans or to another unemployment fund.",
                "● As a labour-intensive export and home market business we need to attract the most competent workforce to Danish market gardens to maintain and expand our markets. The maintenance of the closed ‑ shop provision will inhibit our development, and the most competent employees elect for other professions.",
                "● The collective ‑ bargaining agreements between the Association of Employers in Gardening and Danish Landscape Gardeners respectively and SID will continue to apply for our employees (and be complied with), even if the closed ‑ shop provision is removed by law. The removal of the closed - shop provision would therefore not cause wage-dumping.",
                "● The introduction of closed ‑ shop provisions was not put in place as an equal deal, where both parties gained something. It does not appear anywhere that Danish market gardeners have received any compensation from SID for agreeing in the past to the closed ‑ shop provision. On the contrary, it is our opinion that the employers were forced to enter into the exclusivity agreement under strong pressure and the threat of industrial action.",
                "● In the last many negotiations for collective ‑ bargaining agreements we have tried to persuade SID to drop the exclusivity agreements. In these negotiations it has not been possible to buy ourselves out of the exclusivity agreement. SID has not even wanted to discuss the problem seriously.",
                "Closed ‑ shop agreements do not belong in a modern society. The individual citizen wants to make his own decisions about his relationship to the trade union movement, and must be expected to be able to do so rationally.",
                "Closed ‑ shop provisions arose at the end of the nineteenth century in a period when industrial action was the order of the day.",
                "Circumstances are now quite different, so closed ‑ shop provisions should be removed by law. This would not be State interference with the right of free negotiation on the labour market, but the necessary safeguarding of freedom of association.",

On the basis of the material available, however, the Government estimated that the total number of employed in the gardening and horticultural sector amounted to at least 20,800 persons. The relevant employers'organisations in the private sector had reported that around 11,000 persons were covered by closed-shop agreements, whereas the relevant trade unions had reported that 8,100 persons were covered. Thus, the Government estimated that less than 53 % but more than 39 % of persons were covered by closed ‑ shop agreements.",
                "The applicant Rasmussen submitted that the Government's calculation was misleading and irrelevant to an assessment of the possibility of him finding a job which was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement. He stressed that there were three different kinds of gardeners: landscape gardeners; greenhouse gardeners; and production gardeners. It was crucial to distinguish among the three kinds of gardening because job opportunities in the public sector almost exclusively related to landscape gardeners. Moreover, although the applicant Rasmussen possessed the qualifications to obtain a job at a nursery, this did not imply that he would be qualified to work in landscape gardening – be it in the public or private sector. A calculation should be made in respect of each of the three kinds of gardening. The percentages for greenhouse gardening and production gardening would then be seen to be higher, probably 80 % (11,000 employees covered by closed-shop provisions out of 13,700 in the three kinds of gardening in the private sector). Consequently, the percentage would be lower in respect of landscape gardeners. Accordingly, even if the Government were correct in stating that approximately every second job was not covered by closed ‑ shop agreements, it would be more pertinent to say that in the case of the applicant Rasmussen, only one out of five relevant jobs was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement.",

Turning to the present case, the applicant Sørensen was fully aware at the time of his recruitment as a holiday relief worker that his employment was conditional on membership of a trade union affiliated to LO.

To begin with, this would affect the relatively large number of employees who would lose the rights they had earned under the collective agreements with the consequence that they would risk being underpaid. Similarly, large enterprises could not be sure of peace in the workplace in the same way as when there was only one trade union movement. This might lead to unproductive battles between competing trade unions. Enterprises and employees would both stand to lose from such a situation. Furthermore, trades with special problems could not protect themselves against circumvention of their collective agreements. This was particularly the case for the hairdressing industry in which major problems were predicted. Overall, in the slightly longer term, an unavoidable practical consequence of a complete prohibition on closed ‑ shop clauses would be the impossibility of combating underpayment of employees in a number of areas and peace in the workplace."

                "52. In the somewhat longer term, the consequences of a complete prohibition on closed - shop clauses would be more difficult to predict. This hinged on a number of factors. Potentially, the consequences could be very far-reaching. The lack of possibilities of enforcing collective agreements – as regards small enterprises and special areas – would not only have a negative effect on the employees. This would also be considered unfair competition in relation to enterprises that had and observed collective agreements in force. The harm caused by this would obviously vary from one industry to the next, but in the long term it was certain that some affiliated enterprises, which observed collective agreements, would be unable to resist this unfair competition. If widespread, the consequences would increase. First and foremost, this would create a wage push from within the agreement area. This might have two different outcomes. Firstly, it would become more difficult to negotiate pay increases in connection with collective bargaining. Secondly, pay would – within the scope of the collective agreement – be close to the minimum wage compared with today where many areas are at levels that are considerably above the minimum pay stipulated by the collective agreement. This meant that pay trends would in effect be influenced by the intervention of the legislator – which was in contravention of the fundamental elements of the Danish model under which pay and working conditions evolved through self-regulation among the social partners. In addition, if unfair competition became as widespread as feared, the motivation to be a member of an employers'association would be reduced. It should therefore be considered a reasonable possibility that fewer employers would be affiliated. This would mean lower coverage of collective agreements. Furthermore, this would reduce the employees'motivation to join a trade union since the trade union movement's main service – conditions provided for by collective agreements – could no longer be offered to the same extent. Summarising the consequences of the complete prohibition of closed - shop clauses in the longer term, it became obvious that a regrettable and highly realistic risk existed that : it would affect the enforcement of collective agreements; it would affect the high unionisation rate; it would affect the high coverage of collective agreements; and pay trends would be interfered with."

The sum of these possible consequences meant that the foundation of the Danish model – which had had broad political backing for more than one hundred years – might begin to crumble. If so, to maintain the overall welfare level, Denmark would, within the foreseeable future, have to give up the extensive use of self-regulation and let Parliament handle the regulation of pay and employment conditions to a greater extent.

However, it is difficult to decide this issue in the abstract since it is a matter that can only be properly addressed in the circumstances of a given case. At the same time, an individual cannot be considered to have renounced his negative right to freedom of association in situations where, in the knowledge that trade union membership is a precondition of securing a job, he accepts an offer of employment notwithstanding his opposition to the condition imposed. Accordingly, the distinction made between pre-entry closed ‑ shop agreements and post-entry closed-shop agreements in terms of the scope of the protection guaranteed by Article 11 is not tenable.

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 144, ECHR 2004 - V, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, §§ 98 et seq., ECHR 2003-VIII).",

                "However, where the domestic law of a Contracting State permits the conclusion of closed-shop agreements between unions and employers which run counter to the freedom of choice of the individual inherent in Article 11, the margin of appreciation must be considered reduced. The Court reiterates in this connection that, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 112- 13). In assessing whether a Contracting State has remained within its margin of appreciation in tolerating the existence of closed-shop agreements, particular weight must be attached to the justifications advanced by the authorities for them and, in any given case, the extent to which they impinge on the rights and interests protected by Article 11. Account must also be taken of changing perceptions of the relevance of closed-shop agreements for securing the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom.",

The Court will examine whether the applicants were in fact compelled to join a particular trade union and, in the affirmative, whether such compulsion struck at the very substance of the negative right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. It observes that the present case concerns the application of pre-entry closed-shop agreements to the applicants. They were both aware before taking up their respective jobs that an obligation existed to join SID, and that this was a condition for obtaining and retaining their employment. The Government have argued that the applicants'situation differs from those dealt with previously by the Court since the applicants could never have assumed the contrary. In the Court's view, however, the fact that the applicants accepted membership of SID as one of the terms of employment does not significantly alter the element of compulsion inherent in having to join a trade union against their will. Had they refused they would not have been recruited. In this connection, the Court can accept that individuals applying for employment often find themselves in a vulnerable situation and are only too eager to comply with the terms of employment offered."

The Government have further submitted that the applicants could have chosen to seek employment with an employer who had not entered into a closed-shop agreement and that this option was open to them since in general less than 10 % of the labour market was affected by closed ‑ shop agreements. Closed-shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market and are no longer concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and LO (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 above). The Court for its part can accept this analysis.

It is not in dispute that the applicant Sørensen could have found holiday relief employment elsewhere with an employer who had not entered into a closed-shop agreement, and it appears to be common ground that, since at the relevant time he was 21 years old, had just finished his military service and was about to commence his university studies, he was not in the long term dependent on keeping his job with FDB, which in any event would only have lasted ten weeks. The Government have argued that his situation cannot be compared with the hardship and the serious consequences that arose for the applicants in, for example, the above-cited cases of Young, James and Webster and Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson. However, it must be observed that the applicant Sørensen was dismissed without notice as a direct result of his refusal to comply with the requirement to become a member of SID, a requirement which had no connection with his ability to perform the specific job or his capacity to adapt to the requirements of the workplace. In the Court's opinion, such a consequence can be considered serious and capable of striking at the very substance of the freedom of choice inherent in the negative right to freedom of association protected by Article 11 of the Convention."

He had been a member of SID in the mid- 1 980s but resigned his membership and joined the Christian Trade Union instead. Following a period of unemployment, on 17 May 1999 he commenced his current employment at a nursery after rejoining SID, this being one of the conditions for the job. It is impossible to know whether he would have remained unemployed had he not at the relevant time accepted his current job which included obligatory membership of SID. It is speculative whether, if he were to resign his membership of SID, he could find employment elsewhere with an employer who had not entered into a closed-shop agreement. It is certain, however, that should the applicant Rasmussen resign from SID, he would be dismissed without the possibility of reinstatement or compensation since the dismissal would be in accordance with the Danish Freedom of Association Act. Moreover, although closed ‑ shop agreements do not extend to the entire horticultural sector, they are nevertheless very common (see paragraphs 22, 26, 30 and 32 above). In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the applicant Rasmussen can be considered to be individually and substantially affected by the application of the closed ‑ shop agreement to him."

Instead, the applicant Sørensen joined Denmark's Free Trade Union, and the applicant Rasmussen wishes to rejoin the Christian Trade Union. The Government have pointed out that the applicants had the possibility of subscribing to a form of “non-political membership” of SID or of any other trade union pursuant to the Private Contributions to Political Parties and Disclosure of the Accounts of Political Parties Act (see paragraph 21 above). However, it is to be observed that such “non-political membership” does not entail any reduction in the payment of the membership fee to the specific trade union. In any event, there is no guarantee that “non-political membership” will not give rise to some form of indirect support for the political parties to which the specific trade union contributes financially."

In the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the government stated among other things (see paragraph 28 above) that they “consider that there should be freedom for an employee to decide whether to become a member of an association – just as there should be freedom to choose not to become a member of an association – without this leading to a risk of not being recruited or of being dismissed” and that they “find it unreasonable that a clause in a collective agreement may prevent an employee who does not wish to be a member of an association or a specific association from obtaining or keeping employment with an employer or may prevent an employer from considering the candidate's qualifications alone ”."

It is true that in the context of the Danish debate on this topic LO has voiced its opposition to the attempts to eliminate the remaining areas where pre-entry closed ‑ shop agreements continue to be applied. LO has pointed to the severe consequences which the prohibition of closed-shop clauses would entail, and in particular its view that it would become difficult or impossible to enforce collective agreements vis-à-vis small non-affiliated employers (see paragraph 51 above). However, the Court considers that these concerns have been adequately addressed by the Minister for Employment in his reply to question no. 7 put by the parliamentary committee, namely that an annulment of a closed ‑ shop provision in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement with a non ‑ organised employer would not change the fact that the collective ‑ bargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with (see paragraph 29 above).

The Court also observes that the desire of the Danish legislature to bring an end to the use of closed-shop agreements in the private sector is consistent with the manner in which the 1961 Social Charter has been applied to the issue of pre-entry closed-shop agreements. In its Conclusions XIV ‑ 1, XV-1 and XVI-1, the European Committee of Social Rights found that the Danish Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act infringed Article 5 of the Social Charter (see paragraph 35 above) and accordingly the Governmental Committee proposed that a recommendation be addressed to Denmark. Admittedly, at the 740 th meeting of the Ministers'Deputies in February 2001 the required majority was not obtained. However, shortly thereafter, in September 2002, the Danish government informed the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter of their intention to introduce a bill prohibiting closed - shop agreements and the latter therefore decided to await the next assessment by the European Committee of Social Rights. Subsequently, when it had become clear that the bill had failed to secure the necessary majority in Parliament and was withdrawn, in its Conclusions XVII-1 of March 2004 the European Committee of Social Rights maintained that the Danish Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act infringed Article 5 of the Social Charter, in response to which the government stated that once the parliamentary situation was more favourable they would resubmit the draft legislation (see paragraph 35 above)."

If the withdrawal were upheld, the first applicant would be forced to return to Switzerland in order to receive the benefits which were necessary for her quality of life, which meant that either she would have to live separately from her mother or the latter would be obliged, in order to avert such separation, to return to Switzerland to live with her daughter, which would entail separation from her current husband. The right to respect for the home would also be affected, since the insured person would be forced to move to Switzerland. The applicants took the view that the said infringement was also discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 8, because the benefits had been withdrawn for reasons linked to the nature of the insured person ’ s disability: she had been born with a health impairment and had therefore not been able to contribute to the disability insurance scheme before the disability had occurred."

In short, the Federal Court found that the withdrawal of the right to an extraordinary invalidity pension and a disability allowance on account of the lack of a private address and residence in Switzerland did not fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. In that connection, the court emphasised that the benefits in question had not pursued the aim of protecting family life or intervening in personal or family relations.",
                "“ 4.1 ... Art. 8 para. 1 ECHR also protects the individual ’ s right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person ’ s home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference ( see ECtHR judgment Moreno v. Spain, 16 November 2004, ECHR Reports 2004-X p. 307 § 53).",
                "4.2 According to the constant case-law of the ECtHR, Art. 8 ECHR does not give rise to direct entitlement to social insurance benefits. The Court has indeed acknowledged that while the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, there may, in certain circumstances, be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, among other authorities, Botta, § 33). However, it has held that Art. 8 ECHR does not impose on the Contracting States any obligation to provide specific financial assistance or to guarantee a specific standard of living ( see Petrovic v. Austria, 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II p. 579 § 26 et seq., and the inadmissibility decision in Pancenko v. Latvia, 28 October 1999). That provision places no restriction on the Contracting States ’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, 12 April 2006, ECHR Reports 2006-VI p. 159, § 53). The ECtHR has thus considered that a refusal to grant a parental leave allowance cannot amount to a failure to respect family life, since Article 8 of the Convention does not impose any positive obligation on States to provide the financial assistance in question ( see Petrovic, § 26).",
                "Consequently, given that Art. 8 ECHR does not give rise to entitlement to a specific standard of living or to a positive obligation to provide a social insurance benefit, the withdrawal of the benefits in question owing to the insured person ’ s departure from Switzerland does not amount to an interference with private or family life. Nor does this measure impinge on the necessary respect for the home within the meaning of Art. 8 ( 1 ) ECHR and the European Court ’ s case-law, which the appellants have interpreted broadly, as it does not involve any practical infringement of the area in which their private and family life develops. Furthermore, it is plain that the appellants were not impeded by the Swiss authorities in their choice of way of life and the development of their family relations in Switzerland or abroad; in particular, they were not prevented from maintaining family and social relations in this country, from settling in it or leaving it as they wished.",
                "It should be pointed out here that in all cases where the European Court has considered a denial of specific social insurance benefits in the light of the rights secured under the ECHR, it has relied on Protocol No. 1 of 20 March 1952 to the ECHR, as, for example, in Moskal v. Poland, 15 September 2009, § § 93 et seq ., cited by the appellants ( see also Stec and Others, § 53, and Koua Poirrez v France, 30 September 2003, ECHR Reports 2003-X p. 45 § § 43 et seq. ). Since Switzerland has not ratified that protocol, it is not bound by the Court ’ s case-law concerning the non- discriminatory granting of social security benefits based on Article 1 of the protocol.",
                "4.3 Contrary to the appellants ’ subsequent submissions, the withdrawal of the social insurance benefits in question does not, from a thematic perspective, fall within the scope of Art. 8 ECHR, which would enable them to pray in aid Art. 14 ECHR. That provision, which complements the other substantive provisions of the ECHR, can apply in the absence of an infringement of those provisions, provided that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of them (see, among many other authorities, Konstantin Markin v Russia, 22 March 2012, § 129 ...).",
                "Generally speaking, the insurance invalidity benefit provided for in Swiss law is a social insurance benefit designed to offset the loss of earnings sustained by an insured person on account of the effects of a health impairment on his or her ability to work, or to compensate for an inability to perform everyday actions as a result of a health problem. The extraordinary invalidity pension pursues the same aim for individuals who have been disabled since birth ( or have become disabled without having acquired entitlement to an ordinary pension ). As regards the invalidity allowance, it is awarded on the basis of a long-term need for assistance by others or for the personal supervision of the insured person concerned in performing ordinary everyday actions on account of a health impairment.",
                "Those social insurance benefits are paid regardless of the beneficiaries ’ lifestyle, that is, irrespective of whether they live alone, with family or in an institution ( with certain exceptions irrelevant to the present case: see, for example, section 42 ( 5 ) LAI and section 35bis ( 3 ) RAI). From that angle, the benefits are, precisely, intended to enable adult beneficiaries to lead as autonomous a life as possible, without having to depend on help and assistance from members of their families. They are not designed to promote family life or to intervene in personal or family relationships. Contrary to the examples cited by the appellants, and according to a legal opinion to which they refer (Matthias Kradolfer, op. cit., p. 73), to wit a parental leave allowance ( see Petrovic, § 27) and an ‘ assistance pension ’ paid to the parents of a disabled child ( see Moskal v Poland § 93), the Swiss extraordinary invalidity pension and disability allowance are not aimed at enabling one of the parents to remain at home in order to look after their (adult) child. Accordingly, the withdrawal of those benefits on account of the non-fulfilment of the criterion of ordinary residence in Switzerland laid down in domestic law does not fall within the scope of Article 8 ECHR. ”"

Foreign residents can also obtain this pass if there is a “sufficient link” with the State of origin. Italy allows beneficiaries of some benefits to retain them abroad, albeit only for six months or for serious medical reasons. Poland also permits the exportation of specific benefits in the event of a temporary absence from the country.

It was first and foremost a mixed benefit : on the one hand it had specific social- security features in that the persons concerned had a clearly defined right to that benefit and it covered the invalidity risk; on the other hand it was also linked to social assistance in that it was not based on periods of work or contribution and was not aimed at mitigating a situation of need by providing a minimum living wage to a socially underprivileged group ( young persons with disabilities ). The extraordinary pension was also a special benefit, since it was an alternative allowance aimed at persons who did not fulfil the insurance conditions to obtain an ordinary invalidity pension; it was closely linked to the socio- economic situation in Switzerland, since it corresponded to the minimum pension in that State. Finally, the extraordinary pension was non- contributory, as it was not funded from contributions but exclusively by the Confederation ( see proposal of 28 June 2010 cited above, p. 8).”"

That amounted to a disproportionate interference with their family life, because a separation, an emotional abandonment would be required to enable the disabled person to retain the same quality of life, whereas that would not have been the situation if payment of the pensions had continued, as in the case of a person who had become disabled as a result of an accident."

However, should the Court decide the opposite, namely that the first applicant ’ s situation was comparable to that of a person having contributed to the insurance scheme, and even assume that the two types of pension (contributory/non-contributory) were not sufficiently different to justify different types of regulations, the Government considered that the different conditions applicable to the two types of pension were justified on grounds inherent in insurance law."

The preservation of that solidarity mechanism depended on the will and the trust of other people, which required it to be subject to certain limits. Thus the Government considered that the impugned legislation had pursued a legitimate aim, that is, the country ’ s economic well-being. They explained that the social security system was an extremely complex State construction which comprised a balanced and coordinated set of measures to protect the population against the vicissitudes of life.

On the other hand, extraordinary invalidity pensions were, with some reservations, equal to the minimum amount of the corresponding full ordinary pensions, and they did not depend on any loss of earnings or average annual income, but corresponded to a lump sum, that is to say the minimum pension.

Furthermore, extraordinary disability-insurance pensions had been included on the list of that type of benefit (Annex X to Regulation no. 883/224/EC). Consequently, they were granted exclusively in the Member State ( Switzerland ) in which the person in question lived and in accordance with its legislation ( Article 70 § 2 of the Regulation ). The Government recalled, in that regard, that in judgment ATF 141 V 530 of 11 September 2015 the Federal had confirmed that extraordinary invalidity pensions met all the requisite criteria to qualify as special benefits within the meaning of Article 70 § 2 of Regulation no. 883/2004."

It followed that the arrangements for paying the benefits in question, as recognised and accept by the States Parties to the ALCP in the light of the specific features of special non- contributory cash benefits, could not be deemed contrary to the Convention. The Government stated that the same reasoning also applied to the disability allowance (Article 42 ( 1 ) LAI), as the States Parties to the ALCP had recognised the close link with Switzerland on account of the non-contributory nature of that benefit ( see ATF 142 V 2, point 6, and paragraph 42 above )."

In other words, Switzerland could not be expected to ensure that social welfare benefits which were funded exclusively from taxation were also paid abroad. The added that the benefits in issue were closely linked to the socio-economic context of Switzerland because they corresponded to the minimum pension payable in that country.

A difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down by the Convention must not only pursue a legitimate aim: Article 14 will also be violated when it is clearly established that there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised ( see, for example, Zarb Adami, cited above, § 72; Stec and Others, § 51; Petrovic, cited above, § 30; and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, § 177)."

Indeed, Article 14 does not prohibit distinctions in treatment which are founded on an objective assessment of essentially different factual circumstances and which, being based on the public interest, strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Convention ( see, among other authorities, G.M.B. and K.M. v.

There is, therefore, nothing unusual or arbitrary about it. Secondly, the classification as “non- contributory benefits” of the two benefits in issue in the present case, to wit, an extraordinary invalidity pension and a disability allowance, is in conformity with the practice of Council of Europe member States and with EU law. Thirdly, it cannot be overlooked that the fact of making entitlement to non-contributory benefits subject to a condition of residence in the paying country is the general rule in almost all the member countries of the Council of Europe and in all three Council of Europe non-member States compared (see paragraph 31 above).

In that regard, the Court considers particularly relevant the Government ’ s argument to the effect that a non-contributory benefit is supposed to guarantee that disabled persons who did not satisfy the conditions for obtaining an ordinary pension could benefit from the solidarity of others and have the requisite means of subsistence to live in Switzerland. However, it is not contrary to the Convention to hold that the preservation of that solidarity mechanism depends on the will and the trust of other people, which requires the grant of benefits to be subject to certain conditions, for example requiring beneficiaries to have their ordinary residence in Switzerland.

The allowance had initially been intended only for Italian citizens and had subsequently been extended to all European Union nationals.

According to the Court of Cassation, this interpretation was confirmed by Article 65 (1) and ( 2 ) of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, which referred in particular to “sickness and maternity benefits, invalidity, old-age and survivors ’ benefits, industrial accident and occupational disease benefits and death, unemployment and family benefits”. The Court of Cassation stressed that its interpretation was not based solely on the reference in the text to “ social security ” ( previdenza sociale ) but, as indicated by the CJEU, on the elements comprising each benefit."

If the Court of Cassation had misapplied the “ acte clair ” doctrine and failed in its duty to refer a question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling, the applicant could have brought a civil action to establish non ‑ contractual liability on the part of the State, as advocated by the CJEU in its judgments in Kobler (30 September 2003, Case C-224/01) and Traghetti del Mediterraneo (13 June 2006, Case C-173/03).

Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 44, ECHR 2002-X). In the present case the Government did not raise any objection as to failure to exhaust domestic remedies in their observations of 9 October 2013 on admissibility and the merits (in which, on the contrary, they stated that the judgment of the Court of Cassation “constitute [d] exhaustion of domestic remedies”). The fact that the applicant had not brought a civil action to establish non-contractual liability on the part of the State was first mentioned in their additional observations on the merits and on just satisfaction.

The applicant stressed that, in so far as it had been called upon to rule as the court of last instance, the Court of Cassation had been required to request a preliminary ruling where there was doubt as to the interpretation of Community law. The applicant submitted that he had cited the case-law in which the CJEU had recognised the direct applicability of the principle of non-discrimination in the field of social security, contained in the agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco (and in other agreements between the European Union and the Maghreb countries – Kziber, Case C-18/90, judgment of 31 January 1991). In the applicant ’ s view, that line of case-law, initially developed in the context of the cooperation agreements, was “ fully transposable ” to the relevant provisions of the association agreements. The CJEU had also added that its interpretation was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Furthermore, the interpretation of the concept of “ social security ” by the CJEU was sufficiently broad to encompass social-assistance benefits. In these circumstances, the applicant argued, it had not been open to the Court of Cassation to ignore the request to refer the question for a preliminary ruling."

            [
                "28. The applicant added that the Court of Cassation had given no reasons for refusing to seek a preliminary ruling and had misunderstood the “ personal ” and “ material ” aspects of the non-discrimination principle, which were two quite separate concepts. The allowance in question had been placed in the “ social assistance ” category solely on the basis of domestic law, without reference to the criteria established by the CJEU ( namely the statutory nature and dual function of the benefit and its connection to one of the risks referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation No 1408/71). Hence, the “ Community ” dimension of that categorisation operation had been overlooked. In the applicant ’ s submission, it was clear from the European legislation and the case - law of the CJEU that State ‑ funded “ non-contributory ” benefits could not be automatically excluded from the scope of the non - discrimination principle established by the Agreement (the applicant cited, by way of example, the cases of Yousfi, Case C-58/93, judgment of 20 April 1994, concerning the granting of a disability allowance; Commission v. Greece, Case C-185/96, judgment of 29 October 1998, concerning various categories of benefits for large families; and Hughes, Case C-78/91, judgment of 16 July 1992, on the subject of the “ family credit ” in the United Kingdom ). On the basis of his references to that case-law, the Court of Cassation should either, of its own accord, have included the allowance he was claiming within the scope of Regulation no. 1408/71, by analogy, or referred the question to the CJEU, which had not yet ruled on the nature of this particular allowance."

In judgment no. 133 of 2013 the Constitutional Court had found that the requirement to have been resident for five years in the region concerned in order to qualify for a regional allowance of a similar nature was unreasonable and incompatible with the principle of equality before the law (the applicant also cited judgment no. 222 of 2013)."

The Court of Cassation had therefore considered the provision it had been asked to interpret to be clear; accordingly, it had fulfilled its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

                "– Article 6 § 1 requires the domestic courts to give reasons, in the light of the applicable law, for any decision refusing to refer a question for a preliminary ruling;",
                "– when the Court hears a complaint alleging a violation of Article 6 § 1 on this basis, its task consists in ensuring that the impugned refusal has been duly accompanied by such reasoning;",

                "– in the specific context of the third paragraph of Article 234 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (current Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) ), this means that national courts against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, and which refuse to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on a question raised before them concerning the interpretation of European Union law, are required to give reasons for such refusal in the light of the exceptions provided for by the case-law of the CJEU. They must therefore indicate the reasons why they have found that the question is irrelevant, that the European Union law provision in question has already been interpreted by the CJEU, or that the correct application of EU law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt."

However, it was necessary to take account of the fact that non-Community nationals also made an active contribution to the country ’ s resources, in particular through their additional contribution to social - insurance schemes and the fact that they were subject to income tax.

Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see X and Others v.

The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 82, Series A no. 94)."

He paid contributions to that insurance agency in the same capacity and on the same basis as workers who were European Union nationals ( see, mutatis mutandis, Gaygusuz, cited above, § 46). He was not an alien residing in the country for a short period or in breach of the immigration legislation. Hence, he did not belong to the category of persons who, as a rule, do not contribute to the funding of public services and in relation to whom a State may have legitimate reasons for curtailing the use of resource-hungry public services such as social insurance schemes, public benefits and health care ( see, mutatis mutandis, Ponomaryovi, cited above, § 54)."

It remains to be determined whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the above-mentioned legitimate aim and the means employed in the present case. The Court points out in that connection that the national authorities ’ refusal to grant the family allowance to the applicant was based solely on the fact that he was not a national of a European Union Member State. It is not disputed that a citizen of such a State in the same position as the applicant would receive the allowance in question. Nationality was therefore the sole criterion for the distinction complained of. However, the Court reiterates that very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before it could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see paragraph 46 above). In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the wide margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in the field of social security, the arguments submitted by the Government are not sufficient to satisfy the Court that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality in the instant case that would render the impugned distinction compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, Andrejeva, cited above, §§ 86 ‑ 89)."

                "“[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans'and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services ( Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance:'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.",
                "The secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons'and widows'pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at a reduced rate), whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of WMA.",
                "In 1985 the government published a Green Paper on Social Security Reform which pointed out (in paragraph 10.9) that the current system of benefits dated from days when far fewer married women worked:",
                "' Today two thirds of all married women with children over school age, and over a half of widows between 40 and 60, go to work. The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows'other income, in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children. The Government's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support, and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work.'",
                "Despite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions, the Social Security Act 1986 made relatively modest adjustments to the system. The 26 week transitional widow's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [Widow's Payment:'WPt'] of £1,000 substituted. The age at which WP became payable, whether on bereavement or cessation of WMA, was raised to 45 and entitlement to the full rate postponed until 55. These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the 1992 Act.",
                "The 1986 changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows. But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that WP should be extended to men. It is true that Cruse, a non-governmental organisation for'the widowed and their children', which had taken widowers on board in 1980, said in their 1986-87 annual report:",
                "' We ... continued to press for a widower's pension, based on his wife's national insurance contributions, and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers.'",
                "But this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of WP for widowers in Parliament. The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from the European Commission. There had been a Council Directive 79/7/EEC in 1978 on'the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security'which expressly excluded survivors'benefits. In 1987 the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive (Com (87) 494 Final). It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of the Court of Justice in Razzouk and Beydoun v Commission of the European Communities (Cases 75/82 and 117/82), [1984] ECR 1509, 1530, para 16 (a case concerning survivors'pensions under the Community's own Staff Regulations) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women'forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure.'Article 4 of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits:",
                "( a) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows;",
                "( b ) or the replacement of widows'benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex.'",
                "The House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities (Sub-Committee C) held an inquiry into the proposal in 1989. Miss Joan C. Brown, a writer on social security matters, said in evidence to the Committee that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows. The only way to produce equality was to level down. But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen many years earlier to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children:",
                "' the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through. This suggests the need to phase out the older widow's pension over a long period —in the order of 10-15 years. Without this, there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of their day and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result.'",
                "The Select Committee accepted Miss Brown's evidence and reported (Session 1988-89, 10th Report, HL Paper 51):",
                "' In the United Kingdom ... there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme, irrespective of her earnings, if she is aged 45 or more when her husband dies. This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re-establishing herself in the labour market —whereas a widower's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way.",
                "The Committee consider that, despite these difficulties, the concept of equal treatment must require that, eventually, men and women should be provided with survivors'benefits on the same terms. Employment patterns are changing and, if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives, it will make sense for equal survivors'benefits to be available. There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother, rather than the father, becomes the principal breadwinner. It would, however, be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality. To reduce this danger, a substantial period should be allowed —at least 15 years —before Member States are obliged to equalise survivors'benefits. Community law recognises a principle of'legitimate expectation'which would support this approach.'",
                "The Government published its response on 4 April 1990 (Cm 1038). It said at para 15:",
                "' Within the state social security system the Government do not think there is any merit in introducing a universal state insurance benefit for widowers on a par with those currently provided for widows. To extend the current provisions for widows to widowers would cost about £350 million a year. The available evidence indicates that widowers are more likely to be in full time work than widows, are more likely to have higher earnings than widows and are less likely to have dependent children.

No one suggested paying WP to widowers or, unsurprisingly, abolishing WP for widows. Cruse said in evidence in these proceedings that Mr Hartley Booth's decision to confine his Private Member's Bill to WMA was'tactical'but the need for such tactics suggests that there would have been little support for anything more.",
                "The abolition of WP came as part of a wider reform of survivorship and other social security benefits in the 1999 Act. It was preceded in 1998 by a Consultation Paper which drew attention to the fact that, in 1995, 7 out of 10 married women worked compared with 1 in 8 in 1946. Half of widows under 60 worked and 47% of widows now had income from occupational pension schemes. The Government took the view that widows without dependent children no longer needed long term support. The extension of WP to men was'not acceptable': it would cost another £250 million a year and would mean giving help to people who were, as a class, unlikely to need it.",
                "But the abolition of WP was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be a breach of faith to deny it to the widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available. An opposition amendment deferring the abolition of WP until 2020 was defeated but the Government agreed that the changes should not come into force until 9 April 2001 and that the rights of women bereaved before that date should be preserved. ”",

The same did not apply to widowers. The question was not, therefore, whether there was justification for not paying WP to men, but rather whether there was justification for not having moved faster in abolishing its payment to women. The history of WP ( set out in paragraph 15 above) demonstrated that the decision to achieve equality between men and women by levelling down survivors'benefits, subject to vested rights, was by no means easy or obvious. It was true that by 2000 the proportion of older women (50-59) who were “economically active” was 65.9% against 72.5% for men. But those figures had to be adjusted to reflect greater part-time working by women (44% as against 9%) and the concentration of women in low-paid occupations. The comparative disadvantage of women in the labour market had by no means disappeared."

The benefit was first introduced in 1925, in recognition of the fact that older widows, as a group, faced financial hardship and inequality because of the married woman's traditional role of caring for husband and family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. Despite the increase in women entering the workforce over the next sixty years, in 1985, when the Government proposed reforms to the social security system, it was still considered necessary by Parliament to provide support to older widows, only half of whom were in paid employment of any kind. It was not until 1998 that the Government, in a Consultation Paper, proposed the abolition of WP in view of the increasing numbers of women in employment or receiving income from an occupational pension scheme. Even then, the proposal was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows, and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be “a breach of faith” to deny it to widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available.

The Court notes that REA is an earnings-related benefit designed to compensate employees or former employees for an impairment of earning capacity due to an accident at work or work-related illness. In or around 1986 it was decided, as a matter of policy, that REA should no longer be paid to claimants who had reached an age at which, even if they had not suffered injury or disease, they would no longer be in paid employment (see paragraphs 2 6 - 30 above). The applicants concede that it was reasonable to aim to stop paying REA to workers after the age when they would, in any event, have retired, and the Court agrees, since the benefit in question is designed to replace or supplement earnings, and is therefore closely connected to employment and working life."

The Sex Discrimination Act 1986 had amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to make it unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women.

                "“ ... the principal aim of the successive legislative amendments ... was to discontinue payment of REA – an allowance designed to compensate for an impairment of earning capacity following an accident at work or occupational disease – to persons no longer of working age by imposing conditions based on the statutory retirement age.",
                "Thus, as a result of those legislative amendments, there is coherence between REA, which is designed to compensate for a decrease in earnings, and the old-age pension scheme. It follows that maintenance of the rules at issue in the main proceedings is objectively necessary to preserve such coherence.",
                "That conclusion is not invalidated by the fact that REA is replaced, when the beneficiary reaches retirement age and stops working, by RA, the rate of which is 25% of REA, since RA is designed to compensate for the reduction in pension entitlement resulting from a decrease in earnings following an accident at work or occupational disease.",
                "It follows that discrimination of the kind at issue in the main proceedings is objectively and necessarily linked to the difference between the retirement age for men and that for women, so that it is covered by the derogation for which Article 7(1)(a) of the Directive provides.”",

There was, however, no justification for introducing sex-based discrimination into the scheme by linking the cut-off date to pension age. The same objective could have been achieved, without unacceptable financial consequences, by adopting a common age-limit for men and women and/ or by the use of overlapping benefit regulations, ensuring that any State pension received was offset against REA.

It was important to note that the Commissioner, in his reference to the European Court of Justice ( ECJ – see paragraphs 17 -18 above), had found that the introduction after 1986 of unequal age conditions on REA had not been necessary to maintain the financial equilibrium of either the REA or the pension scheme. Although the ECJ had decided against them, the applicants emphasised that it had been adjudicating on a different question, namely whether the amendments fell within the scope of the Article 7 exception to the non-discrimination provisions of the Directive. In particular, the ECJ did not have to decide whether there was a proportionate justification for the discrimination, but was instead construing the phrase “the possible consequences thereof for other benefits” in Article 7. The applicants did not consider that a finding in their favour would have wider implications for the case-law of the ECJ under Article 7, since the impact would be limited to other cases where there was no financial necessity to maintain the link between the benefit in question and pensionable age, and no compelling reason to do so. Moreover, the mere fact that a measure which discriminated on grounds of sex nonetheless fell outside the European Union ’ s limited restrictions upon social security discrimination did not prevent this Court from examining for itself the issue of justification."

The labour market had already changed by 1986, and ten years earlier the Sex Discrimination Act 1976 and the European Community ’ s Equal Treatment Directive 76/207/EEC had rendered discrimination in the field of employment unlawful. The assumption that a woman ’ s working life would be five years shorter than a man ’ s was therefore entirely illegitimate."

The Government emphasised that REA was designed to compensate those who had suffered an industrial injury for their loss of earning capacity, and was therefore a benefit linked intrinsically to work. By stopping it at State pensionable age, Parliament had acted in an objectively justified manner by ensuring that a person, whether male or female, would not be eligible both for a State retirement pension and for a benefit for loss of earning capacity. Using pensionable age promoted, in a manner that could easily be understood and administered, and was proportionate, the objective of discontinuing REA for those who were no longer a regular part of the working and earning sector of the population. The Government estimated that, if, following an adverse judgment, it became necessary to reform the REA and RA scheme and reimburse for lost benefits all claimants in the same position as the four applicants, this would cost in the region of GBP 83 million, to which should be added a further GBP one million in administrative costs and GBP 17 million in estimated future payments."

The case-law of the ECJ (see extracts in paragraphs 3 9 -4 1 above) showed this to be a dynamic and evolving area of law in which the ECJ, and the domestic courts bound by its jurisprudence and the Directive, applied a close, proportionality-based analysis to test the continued objective justification for the use of differential ages in access to both State retirement pensions and linked benefits. If the Court were to find a violation in the present case, it would create considerable confusion : the domestic legislation would be lawful under a Directive specifically concerned with sex discrimination in social security, but unlawful under the more general provisions of the Convention."

Finally, the social, historical and economic basis for the provision of State retirement pensions at the age of 65 for men and 60 for women, as well as the decision to equalise pensionable age for men and women progressively from 2010 to 2020, involved complex economic and social judgments, in respect of which the State enjoyed a broad margin of appreciation. Before deciding to set the new equal State retirement pension age at 65, the government had considered several options, summarised in the 1993 White Paper (see paragraphs 3 2 -3 4 above), and a full public consultation exercise had been carried out. The clear conclusion reached was that 6 5 was the correct common State retirement pension age for the United Kingdom. In 1995 Parliament had decided to implement the reform in stages because moving towards equality had enormous financial implications both for the State and for individuals, particularly women who had long been expecting to receive a State retirement pension at 60 (see paragraphs 3 4 - 3 5 above). Several Contracting States retained different pension ages for men and women, and a number had chosen to implement a gradual equalisation of those ages (see paragraphs 3 6 -3 7 above). Moreover, the European Community had accepted that its member States must be allowed a period of transition in which to plan and implement the move to equal ages for men and women in relation to State pensionable age ( see paragraph 3 8 above)."

Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000-IV). A difference of treatment is, however, discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I)."

As a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of sex as compatible with the Convention (see Van Raalte, cited above, § 39, and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 263). On the other hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98, and National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports 1997-VII ). Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( ibid. )."

The applicants concede that it was reasonable to aim to stop paying REA to workers after the age when they would, in any event, have retired, and the Court agrees, since the benefit in question is designed to replace or supplement earnings, and is therefore closely connected to employment and working life."

Overlapping benefit regulations, to ensure that any REA received was deducted from the State retirement pension would, moreover, have maintained the impugned difference of treatment, since women would still have become entitled to their pensions and liable to start receiving reduced-rate REA five years before men."

While it is true that Article 7(1)(a) of the Directive provides an express exception to the general prohibition on discrimination in social security (see paragraph 3 8 above), the ECJ was called upon, in deciding whether the case fell within the Article 7 exception, to make a judgment as to whether the discrimination in the REA scheme arising from the link to differential pensionable ages was objectively necessary in order to ensure consistency with the pension scheme. In reaching a conclusion on this issue which, while not determinative of the issue under Article 14 of the Convention, is nonetheless of central importance, particular regard should be had to the strong persuasive value of the ECJ ’ s finding on this point."

This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment.

However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 5 2 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 3 7 above).

He noted the circumstances in which Mrs McCann had signed the notice to quit and observed that, if she had not been induced to sign it, the local authority would have had to apply for a possession order under section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 below). It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order; he and Mrs McCann could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited.

The marriage broke down and the joint tenancy came to an end when Mrs Qazi served a notice to quit. Mr Qazi was refused a sole tenancy by the local authority, but he nonetheless remained in occupation with his new family, and sought to resist possession proceedings on the ground that they constituted an interference with the right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Convention."

                "23. The House of Lords were unanimous in holding that, despite the fact that the tenancy had come to an end, the property continued to be Mr Qazi ’ s home and Article 8 was therefore engaged. However, the majority (Lords Hope of Craighead, Millett and Scott of Foscote ) held that Article 8 could not be relied upon to defeat the local authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights to possession. Since the local authority had an unqualified right to immediate possession, there was no infringement of Mr Qazi ’ s right to respect for his home under Article 8 § 1 and so no issue arose under Article 8 § 2 as to justification. Alternatively, the effect of the authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights was that any assessment under Article 8 § 2 would inevitably be determined in the local authority ’ s favour. The majority variously referred to a number of decisions of the Commission in which similar complaints, regarding the eviction of a former joint tenant from local ‑ authority property after the joint tenancy had come to an end, had been declared manifestly ill-founded ( see S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11716/85, Commission decision of 14 May 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 47, p. 274; D.P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11949/86, Commission decision of 1 December 1986, DR 51, p. 195; Ure v. the United Kingdom, no. 28027/95, Commission decision of 27 November 1996, unreported; and Wood v. the United Kingdom, no. 32540/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1997, unreported ).",

                "I do not say that the right to respect for the home is irrelevant. But I consider that such interference with it as flows from the application of the law which enables the public - authority landlord to exercise its unqualified right to recover possession, following service of a notice to quit which has terminated the tenancy, with a view to making the premises available for letting to others on its housing list, does not violate the essence of the right to respect for the home under Article 8 § 1. That is a conclusion which can be applied now to all cases of this type generally. ... It follows that the question whether any interference is permitted by Article 8 § 2 does not require, in this case, to be considered by the County Court.”",

                "“ ... [N] o such balancing exercise need be conducted when its outcome is a foregone conclusion. In the present case ... the local authority had an immediate right to possession. The premises were Mr Qazi ’ s home, and evicting him would obviously amount to an interference with his enjoyment of the premises as his home. But his right to occupy them as such was circumscribed by the terms of his tenancy and had come to an end. Eviction was plainly necessary to protect the rights of the local authority as landowner. Its obligation to ‘ respect ’ for Mr Qazi ’ s home was not infringed by its requirement that he vacate the premises at the expiry of the period during which it had agreed that he might occupy them. There was simply no balance to be struck. ... ”",

I would, for my part, have said that Article 8 was not, in these circumstances, applicable. But it could also be said that a possession order was ‘ in accordance with the law ’ and was necessary in order to protect and give effect to the Council ’ s right to possession. ...

I wish to reserve my opinion as to whether it would be open to the tenant, in a wholly exceptional case, to raise these issues in the County Court where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of the notice to quit by the housing authority, bearing in mind as Lord Millett points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable in the High Court so long as the application was made within the relevant time - limit. The situation in the present case is different, as it was a notice to quit served by one of the joint tenants that terminated the tenancy. ”",

Both cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sheffield City Council v. Smart ( cited in paragraph 24 above) :",
                "“26. ... ‘ Home ’ is an autonomous concept for the purpose of ECHR [the Convention], and does not depend on any legal status as owner. Thus in these cases, the premises in Sheffield and Sunderland were without question the women ’ s homes. Since the effect of the possession orders would be to throw them out, I think it inescapable that those orders amounted to an interference with the appellants ’ right of respect of their homes. I have said that the case is all about Article 8; more precisely, it is all about Article 8 § 2.",
                "27. Before proceeding to the issues arising under Article 8 § 2, I should make it clear that I entertain what is perhaps a deeper reason for my view that the case cannot be concluded by a judgment that there is no violation of Article 8 § 1. It concerns the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8. I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes. But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process, the application of a statute ’ s correct construction (here, Article 8 § 1) to a particular set of facts. Rather it has a purposive quality. The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between two possibilities, a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation ’ s words mean. The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the Article 8 § 1 stage ... The second choice (accepting a prima facie violation of Article 8 § 1), which I prefer, entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article 8 § 2 have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants ’ Convention rights. The Convention is, as it were, much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first, rather than the second, choice is taken. Part of the court ’ s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand. Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in Article 8 § 1. I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights, for which purpose [the Human Rights Act 1998] was enacted, require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with the Article 8 § 2 standards. Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights.”",

In such a case, an Article 8 defence, if raised, should simply be struck out.

If the occupier wishes to raise an Article 8 defence to prevent or defer the making of a possession order it is for him to do so and the public authority must rebut the claim if, and to the extent that, it is called upon to do so.

The local authority ’ s decisions to procure a notice to quit from his wife and subsequently to commence possession proceedings were taken in accordance with the law and pursued a number of legitimate aims, namely (a) the protection of the rights of the authority as owner of the property with responsibility for the management of its social housing stock; (b) the protection of the rights and freedoms of others on the authority ’ s waiting list to be provided with housing out of the authority ’ s stock of homes to meet their needs; and (c) the promotion of the economic well ‑ being of the country. Furthermore, given that it was necessary in a democracy to have in place clear and certain rules governing property rights, and in view of the fact that under ordinary property law the authority had an absolute right to recover the property in question, the Government submitted that the interference which arose by virtue of the recognition and implementation of those rights by the courts was “necessary in a democratic society” and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

According to the Government, the present case was distinguishable from Connors (cited above, §§ 81-84; see further paragraph 49 below), where three key features had led the Court to find a violation of Article 8 : firstly, the vulnerable position of Roma as a minority, which imposed a positive obligation on the State to facilitate their way of life; secondly, the absence of procedural protection, which permitted a local authority to remove Roma from an authorised site without any scrutiny by the courts; and, thirdly, the fact that the domestic law discriminated unjustifiably between Roma who resided on private sites and those who resided on local - authority sites. In contrast to the position in Connors, there was no suggestion in the present case that the domestic law of landlord and tenant was itself incompatible with Article 8."

Since, in asking Mrs McCann to sign a notice to quit, the local authority had merely been seeking to regularise the situation which she had created by leaving the house and applying for alternative accommodation, it had been appropriate to ask her to sign the notice and there had been no obligation to explain to her the implications. In circumstances where the relationship between joint tenants had broken down, it was the local authority ’ s policy to obtain a relinquishing form from the departing tenant (see paragraph 21 above). This policy was eminently sensible, since it permitted the local - authority landlord to regain control of its property and thus to manage scarce housing resources effectively. The procedural protection against the termination of a secure tenancy contained in sections 82-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above) were applicable only in circumstances where the landlord was seeking to terminate the tenancy. In the present case, the joint tenancy was brought to an end by the applicant ’ s wife serving notice to quit."

Given that the applicant ’ s central allegation was that the local authority had acted improperly in obtaining the notice to quit from Mrs McCann, judicial review provided an appropriate and adequate remedy, to which the applicant had had access. Moreover, it was now clear from the House of Lords ’ decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above) that an individual in the applicant ’ s position would not need to commence proceedings by way of judicial review in order to raise this kind of public law challenge; such objections could now be raised by way of collateral challenge to possession proceedings in the County Court. The clarification in Kay served to underline the extent of the procedural protection provided to individuals in the applicant ’ s position. In this respect the present case was clearly distinguishable from Connors, where the applicant ’ s contentions (that he was not responsible for the alleged antisocial behaviour) did not relate to abuse of power by the local authority and where he was refused leave to apply for judicial review."

Article 8 was engaged because Mrs McCann would not have served the notice to quit except at the request of the local authority housing officer, and the local authority knew that the notice would have the effect of bringing the joint tenancy to an end without any opportunity for the applicant effectively to challenge the loss of his home. Moreover, the termination of the tenancy affected the applicant ’ s relationship with his children who stayed with him three nights a week. In deciding to ask Mrs McCann to sign the notice to quit, the local authority gave no consideration whatsoever to the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8."

The local authority ’ s actions in obtaining the wife ’ s notice to quit had, in effect, bypassed this statutory scheme, which Parliament had created to protect tenants such as the applicant. While accepting that it would be rare for possession to be refused to the landlord on Article 8 grounds, the applicant contended that to exclude the possibility of individual circumstances rendering an eviction disproportionate was to deprive the Convention of any effect."

In the present case, it was found by the national courts and accepted by the parties that the local - authority house which the applicant formerly occupied as a joint tenant with his wife and where he lived on his own from November 2001 continued to be his “home”, within the meaning of Article 8 § 1, despite the fact that following service by his wife of notice to quit he had no right under domestic law to continue in occupation.

Firstly, it protected the local authority ’ s right to regain possession of the property against an individual who had no contractual or other right to be there. The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts. The Court accepts that it is only by limiting the protection of the Acts to the categories to which it applies that the policy underlying the Acts can sensibly be implemented."

It must be noted that this requirement under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention raises a question of procedure as well as one of substance. The Court set out the relevant principles in assessing the necessity of an interference with the right to “home” by the application of summary possession proceedings in the case of Connors ( cited above, §§ 81 - 84), which was decided subsequent to the House of Lords ’ judgment in Qazi (see paragraphs 22-25 above), but before its decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above), as follows:",
                "“ 81. An interference will be considered ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ for a legitimate aim if it answers a ‘ pressing social need ’ and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention ...",
                "82. In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual ’ s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights ... On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that ‘ [ i ]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ’ ... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual ’ s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community ... Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ....",

The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 ... ”"

The Court is unable to accept the Government ’ s argument that the reasoning in Connors was to be confined only to cases involving the eviction of Roma or cases where the applicant sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case. The loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end."

The Court notes that the legislature in the United Kingdom has set up, through the Housing Acts, inter alia, a complex system for the allocation of public housing, about which the applicant does not complain. That system includes, in section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), provisions to protect secure tenants of public - authority landlords, such as the applicant during the course of the joint tenancy. In accordance with these provisions, a court cannot grant a public - authority landlord possession of a property occupied by a secure tenant except on one of the specified statutory grounds and where it is in addition satisfied that it is reasonable to make such an order. Had the local authority sought to evict the applicant in accordance with this statutory scheme, it would have been open to the applicant to ask the court to examine, for example, whether his wife had really left the family home because of domestic violence and whether in his personal circumstances, including his need to provide accommodation for his children during overnight visits several times a week, it was reasonable to grant the possession order."

In the present case, however, the local authority chose to bypass the statutory scheme by requesting Mrs McCann to sign a common - law notice to quit, the effect of which was immediately to terminate the applicant ’ s right to remain in the house. It does not appear that the authority, in the course of this procedure, gave any consideration to the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home. Moreover, under domestic law (see the majority opinions in Qazi and Kay, paragraphs 22-28 above), in summary proceedings such as those brought against the applicant, it was not open to the County Court to consider any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order, save in exceptional cases where, as the Court of Appeal put it in the present case, “something has happened since the service of the notice to quit, which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction”. No such exceptional circumstances applied in the present case. Furthermore, although since the applicant ’ s landlord was a public authority it was open to him to challenge the decisions to obtain the notice to quit and to bring possession proceedings in an application for judicial review, his application failed because the local authority had not acted unlawfully."

Judicial - review procedure is not well-adapted for the resolution of sensitive factual questions which are better left to the County Court responsible for ordering possession. In the present case, the judicial ‑ review proceedings, like the possession proceedings, did not provide any opportunity for an independent tribunal to examine whether the applicant ’ s loss of his home was proportionate under Article 8 § 2 to the legitimate aims pursued."

Furthermore, the applicant had applied for an exchange of property on 4 January 2002, as the house was too big for his needs. In these circumstances, and given that it was impossible to ascertain what the applicant ’ s position would have been had there been no breach of Article 8 (which was, in any event, denied), the Government submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction or, in the alternative, an amount significantly lower than that in Connors should be awarded."

Nonetheless, the applicant was deprived of his home without the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the issues under Article 8, and the Court thus concludes that he suffered some non-pecuniary damage, in particular feelings of frustration and injustice, not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention (see Connors, cited above, § 114).

In this connection, in the Court’s view, there would appear to be a contradiction between, on the one hand, adopting national and regional programmes on Roma inclusion, based on the understanding that the applicants are part of an underprivileged community whose problems are specific and must be addressed accordingly, and, on the other hand, maintaining, in submissions to the Court, as the respondent Government did in this case, that so doing would amount to “privileged” treatment and would discriminate against the majority population (see paragraphs 41, 60-63 and 95-98 above)."

Unlike some other European countries, where the Roma often have an itinerant way of life, in Bulgaria, at least since the 1960s, the great majority of the Roma live a settled life. Typically, Bulgarian towns feature one or more predominantly Roma neighbourhoods in non-central areas."

A number of blocks of flats were constructed there, but the plots currently inhabited by the applicants remained vacant, having been earmarked for a green area, which was never landscaped."

The issue of Roma settlements, often referred to as “ghettos”, was widely debated in the media. Many commentators urged the emptying of all “Roma ghettos” in Sofia.

Most complaints against the Roma inhabitants of Batalova Vodenitsa concerned sanitary risks and repulsive odours caused by the absence of sewage and the fact that the inhabitants kept animals (allegedly including sheep, pigs, hens and horses). Also, many non-Roma residents of the area believed that the Roma inhabitants were responsible for numerous offences, including physical assault, theft and damage to public and private property.

In March 2000 an unspecified number of individuals, apparently persons who had obtained decisions restoring their property rights over expropriated land in the Batalova Vodenitsa area, complained to the Sofia municipal council that “persons of Roma origin” were unlawfully occupying land in the area. Having examined the matter, on 11 December 2000 the municipal council decided to offer the restored owners other municipal land in exchange for their land. It also invited the mayor of Sofia to develop a plan for the resolution of the “problem as a whole”. No such plan appears to have been adopted."

The Committee found, inter alia, that “the lack of legal security of tenure and the non-respect of the conditions accompanying eviction of Roma families from dwellings unlawfully occupied by them constitute[d] a violation of Article 16 of the Revised European Social Charter, taken together with Article E”.

The Committee also considered that the authorities had tolerated the unlawful Roma settlements for long periods and were accordingly obliged to carefully balance town planning measures against “the right to housing and its corollary of not making individual[s] homeless”. The Committee further found that by failing to take into consideration the specificity of the living conditions of Roma and strictly applying the rules on legalisation of buildings to them, Bulgaria had discriminated against Roma families, whose situation differed not least as a consequence of State non-intervention over a certain period. Similarly, there was discrimination on account of the authorities’ failure to take into account that Roma families ran a higher risk of eviction, and the authorities’ failure systematically to find alternative accommodation for the evicted families."

The racist nature of this assumption which underlay the Government’s argument was evident.

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The Court has noted the following relevant considerations in this respect:",
                "(i) In spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, including as regards housing, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the urban or rural planning context where the Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation” (see, for example, Buckley, cited above, p. 1292, § 75 in fine, and Ćosić, cited above, § 20);",
                "(ii) On the other hand, the margin of appreciation left to the authorities will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights. Since Article 8 concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant (see, among many others, Connors, cited above, § 82);",
                "(iii) The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Buckley, cited above, pp. 1292-93, § 76, and Chapman, cited above, § 92). The “necessary in a democratic society” requirement under Article 8 § 2 raises a question of procedure as well of substance (see McCann, cited above, § 26);",
                "(iv) Since the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right under Article 8 to respect for one’s home, any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality and reasonableness of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, he has no right of occupation (see Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, § 67-8 and 74, 21 September 2010 and Orlić v. Croatia, no. 48833/07, § 65, 21 June 2011). This means, among other things, that where relevant arguments concerning the proportionality of the interference have been raised by the applicant in domestic judicial proceedings, the domestic courts should examine them in detail and provide adequate reasons ( ibid ., §§ 67-69);",
                "(v) Where the national authorities, in their decisions ordering and upholding the applicant’s eviction, have not given any explanation or put forward any arguments demonstrating that the applicant’s eviction was necessary, the Court may draw the inference that the State’s legitimate interest in being able to control its property should come second to the applicant’s right to respect for his home ( ibid ).",

In its view, this fact is highly pertinent and should have been taken into consideration (see, for example, Orlić v. Croatia, § 70, cited above). While the unlawful occupants cannot claim any legitimate expectation to remain, the authorities’ inactivity has resulted in the applicants’ developing strong links with Batalova Vodenitsa and building a community life there. The principle of proportionality requires that such situations, where a whole community and a long period are concerned, be treated as being entirely different from routine cases of removal of an individual from unlawfully occupied property."

Relying on this legal framework, the municipal authorities did not give reasons other than to state that the applicants occupied land unlawfully and, in the judicial review proceedings, the domestic courts expressly refused to hear arguments about proportionality and the lengthy period during which the applicants and their families had lived undisturbed in Batalova Vodenitsa (see paragraphs 29-31 and 36-38 above)."

Among those are legalising buildings where possible, constructing public sewage and water-supply facilities and providing assistance to find alternative housing where eviction is necessary (see paragraphs 60-63, 65, 69, 70, 73-83 and 95 above).

The Court considers, however, that in the specific circumstances of the present case, in view, in particular, of the long history of undisturbed presence of the applicants’ families and the community they had formed in Batalova Vodenitsa, the principle of proportionality required that due consideration be given to the consequences of their removal and the risk of their becoming homeless."

Proportionality in cases such as the present one is inextricably linked to the use for which the authorities seek to recover the land.

In this connection, in the Court’s view, there would appear to be a contradiction between, on the one hand, adopting national and regional programmes on Roma inclusion, based on the understanding that the applicants are part of an underprivileged community whose problems are specific and must be addressed accordingly, and, on the other hand, maintaining, in submissions to the Court, as the respondent Government did in this case, that so doing would amount to “privileged” treatment and would discriminate against the majority population (see paragraphs 41, 60-63 and 95-98 above)."

Such social groups, regardless of the ethnic origin of their members, may need assistance in order to be able effectively to enjoy the same rights as the majority population. As the Court has stated in the context of Article 14 of the Convention, that provision not only does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them but, moreover, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14 (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, § 175; “Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v.

This mechanism apparently functions in practice as seen from relevant examples (see paragraph 71 above) and the applicants have not claimed that they could not resort to it.

The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them ( see paragraph 26 in fine above ) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above)."

The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned.

It said that the enforcement authority should have taken into account that the house had been the claimant ’ s only home.

It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time : the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants ’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate.

The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances."

An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v.

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

                "54. The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73 - 76 below ), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § § 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one ’ s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual ’ s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person ’ s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, § § 114-16 ).

Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37 - 39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above )."

The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them ( see paragraph 26 in fine above ) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above).

There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned.

It had, on the one hand, to ensure the protection of the property rights of the former and, on the other, to respect the social rights of the latter, who were often vulnerable individuals (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 225, and Radovici and Stănescu v.

Rather, a disproportionate and excessive individual burden was placed on the applicant as a landlord, as he was required to bear most of the social and financial costs of providing housing for I.T. and her family (see, mutatis mutandis, Lindheim and Others v.

Since the existence of a specially protected tenancy was a necessary precondition for acquiring the status of a protected lessee under the Lease of Flats Act (see paragraph 11 above) the court had first to determine, as a preliminary issue, whether I.T. had become the holder of the specially protected tenancy after P.A. had moved out of the flat in 1973. The court held that, unlike the subsequent legislation relied on by the applicant, the legislation in force at the material time, namely the Housing Act of 1962, had not defined who could have been considered a member of the household of a holder of a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 27 below). Thus, given that I.T. had been in foster care by P.A. and lived with her in the flat in question, she could have been considered as a member of her household and therefore could, after P.A. had moved out of the flat in 1973, taken over the specially protected tenancy from her and become the holder thereof. Consequently, when in November 1996 the Lease of Flats Act entered into force, I.T. had, as the holder of the specially protected tenancy, become a protected lessee by the operation of law and was entitled to conclude a lease contract stipulating protected rent with the applicant (see paragraphs 39-40 below). While the court ruled that I.T. ’ s son could be listed in the lease contract as a member of her household, it also held that her daughter-in-law and her grandson could not because they had not moved into the flat until after the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act, when specially protected tenancies could no longer be obtained."

The holder of a specially protected tenancy could also sub-let a part of the flat to someone else, participate in the administration of the building in which the flat was located, exchange it for another flat (in agreement with the provider of the flat) and, exceptionally, use part of it for business purposes. In legal theory and judicial practice the specially protected tenancy was described as a right sui generis. Such tenancy could be terminated only in judicial proceedings and on limited grounds, the most important one being failure by the holder to use the flat for living for a continuous period of at least six months without justified reason."

                "25. Until the entry into force of the Housing Act of 1974, specially protected tenancies could be awarded in respect of both socially and privately owned flats. However, in the large majority of cases they were awarded in respect of flats in “social ownership” ( društveno vlasništvo ) – a type of ownership which did not exist in other socialist countries but was particularly highly developed in the former Yugoslavia. According to the official doctrine, property in social ownership had no owner, the role of public authorities in respect of such property being confined to management. With the Housing Act of 1974 it was no longer possible to award specially protected tenancies in respect of flats in private ownership. However, the pre-existing specially protected tenancies in respect of such flats were preserved."

Those acts provided, inter alia, that when a holder of a specially protected tenancy died or moved out of the flat the tenancy was transferred by the operation of law ( ipso jure ) to the members of his or her household, even though in such cases the housing administration could seek eviction of those using the flat if it considered that none of them satisfied the conditions for obtaining that tenancy.

The domestic courts had found that I.T. had become the holder of the specially protected tenancy of the applicant ’ s flat in 1973, when P.A. had moved out of the flat (see paragraph 15 above). On the basis of that status I.T. had, on 5 November 1996, when the Lease of Flats Act entered into force (see paragraphs 11 and 31 above), become the protected lessee ex lege (see paragraph 40 above).

Those provisions were also in the general interest of the community, as their aim was to ease the negative consequences of the transition from the Socialist social and economic system to a democratic system and market economy, which had necessarily entailed the abandonment of the Socialist concept of the specially protected tenancy."

As regards the proportionality of the interference, the Government first reiterated that laws controlling the use of property were especially common in the field of housing, which in modern societies was a central concern of social and economic policies, in the implementation of which the States had a wide margin of appreciation both with regard to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of control and with regard to their implementation. The Court had itself indicated that it would respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what was in the general interest unless that judgment was manifestly without reasonable foundation ( see Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy, 28 September 1995, § 29, Series A no. 315 ‑ B; and Mellacher and Others v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 45, Series A no. 169). The same applied necessarily, if not a fortiori, to such radical social changes as those occurring in Central and Eastern Europe during the transition from the Socialist regime to a democratic state (see Jahn and Others v.

Applying these principles to the present case, the Government argued that the transitional provisions of the Lease of Flats Act struck a socially acceptable and fair balance between the competing interests of, on the one hand, the owners (landlords) of flats previously let under specially protected tenancies who wished to regain greater control over their properties, and, on the other hand, the interests of the former holders of specially protected tenancies in respect of privately owned flats who wanted to continue living in their homes. The protected lease scheme, introduced by those provisions, represented a comprehensive solution to that issue."

Under that arrangement landlords, who during the Socialist regime had been forced to give up their flats to be used by others, had for a certain period of time remained subject to limitations on their right of ownership such as, notably, the inability to regain direct possession of their flats. Those restrictions were an expression of constitutionally permitted limitations on ownership, which, according to the Constitution, entailed duties and obliged owners to contribute to the general welfare (see paragraph 23 above). For their part, the tenants were not allowed to use the flats commercially or enjoy the status of protected lessees in cases where they were no longer in need of housing."

Moreover, the landlords ’ position under the transitional provisions of the Lease of Flats Act was more favourable than their position under the previous legislation enacted during the Socialist period (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). Firstly, it had been uncertain for how long and in respect of which persons landlords, whose flats had been subject to the regime of the specially protected tenancy, would have to tolerate the restrictions on their right of ownership. Under the current system the landlords were certain that their right of ownership was restricted only in respect of those tenants (protected lessees) who had lived in their flat as holders of specially protected tenancies and members of their households on the day of the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act, and only as long as those tenants continued using the flat. There was no possibility for persons who had become members of the protected lessee ’ s household after that date or for any other persons to acquire the status of the protected lessee."

A landlord could also terminate a protected lease if he or she intended to move into the flat (see paragraph 38 and 48 above). As regards the financial benefits which a landlord derived from the protected lease, the Government pointed out that the protected rent had to cover at least the costs of maintenance of the flat and could be higher, whilst under the previous system the rent had only fully covered the costs of maintenance.

On the other hand, neither I.T., who had been living in the flat since 1955, nor the members of her household had had any other accommodation. It was therefore evident that in the present case the application of the relevant provisions of the Lease of Flats Act had not disturbed the fair balance between the general interest of providing housing for I.T. and her family and the applicant ’ s right of ownership. Thus it could not be argued that he had had to bear an excessive individual burden.

Those costs reduced the already low protected rent the applicant had been entitled to receive, which was in any case twenty-five times lower than the market rent. In support of his argument, the applicant ’ s heir submitted an advertisement from the Internet dated 6 December 2011 offering for rent a furnished flat in Split of a similar size (63 square metres) and 450 metres away from the flat in question, for 2,631 Croatian kunas (HRK) per month, that is, HRK 41.76 per square metre."

In the Court ’ s view, there was indisputably an interference with the applicant ’ s property rights in the present case as the protected lease entails a number of restrictions that prevent landlords from exercising their right to use their property. In particular, landlords are unable to exercise that right in terms of physical possession, as the flat remains indefinitely occupied by the tenants, and their rights in respect of letting the flat, including the right to receive the market rent for it and to terminate the lease, are substantially affected by a number of statutory limitations (see paragraphs 125-129 below). However, landlords are not deprived of their title, continue to receive rent, and are free to sell their flats, albeit subject to the terms of the lease. Bearing that in mind, and having regard to its case-law on the matter (see, for example, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, §§ 160-161; Edwards v.

Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, § 57, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I). It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, even in those fields where the Convention “incorporates” the rules of that law, since the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see Pavlinović and Tonić v.

At the same time, their right to derive profit from leasing their flats is subject to statutory restrictions (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 197).

As acknowledged by the Government of Croatia in its attempts to pass amendments to the Lease of Flats Act (see paragraphs 71-80 above) and confirmed by the Ombudsman ’ s findings (see paragraphs 81-83 above), protected rent calculated according to that formula has often been lower than the condominium fee and thus insufficient to cover even the costs of maintenance of the communal areas and installations of the building in which flats are located, let alone the costs of maintenance of the flats themselves. What is more, protected rent is, in the authorities own admission, generally set at the lowest amount (see paragraphs 73, 76 and 80 above).

This has sometimes resulted in paradoxical situations, such as the one described by the Ombudsman in his 2012 Annual Report (see paragraph 83 above), where elderly and impecunious landlords have in fact been subsidising the housing of working-age salaried lessees.

The Court is not convinced that the interests of the applicant as a landlord, including his entitlement to derive profits from his property (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 239), were met by such extremely low returns (see, mutatis mutandis, Ghigo, loc. cit.; Edwards, loc. cit.; and Saliba, loc. cit. )."

The Government, for their part, have not contested that and the information they submitted does not appear to suggest otherwise (see paragraph 112 above). In these circumstances it cannot but be concluded that the amount of the protected rent the applicant was entitled to receive was manifestly disproportionate to the market rent (see, mutatis mutandis, Saliba and Others, cited above, § 65)."

State control over levels of rent is one such measure and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, for example, Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 45; Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 223; and Edwards, cited above, § 76 )."

It had, on the one hand, to ensure the protection of the property rights of the former and, on the other, to respect the social rights of the latter, who were often vulnerable individuals (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 225, and Radovici and Stănescu v.

The general interest of the community in such situations calls for a fair distribution of the social and financial burden involved, which cannot be placed on one particular social group, however important the interests of the other group or the community as a whole (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 225, and Radovici and Stănescu, loc. cit. ).

Rather, a disproportionate and excessive individual burden was placed on the applicant as a landlord, as he was required to bear most of the social and financial costs of providing housing for I.T. and her family (see, mutatis mutandis, Lindheim and Others v.

On the one hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy, for example (see Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 109, ECHR 2014). This also includes measures in the area of taxation. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality (see R.Sz. v. Hungary, no. 41838/11, § 54, 2 July 2013). On the other hand, if a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State ’ s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question. The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs. The Court has already identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their characteristic or status, including disability (see Glor, cited above, § 84; Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 63, ECHR 2011). Moreover, with regard to all actions concerning children with disabilities the best interest of the child must be a primary consideration (see paragraph 34 above; Article 7 § 2 of the CRPD). In any case, however, irrespective of the scope of the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court (see, inter alia, Konstantin Markin v.

This specifically relates to the fact that the residential building in which the flat was located was not equipped with a lift, making it increasingly difficult, as his son grew, for the applicant and his family to take him out of the flat to see a doctor, or to take him for physiotherapy and to kindergarten or school, and to meet his other social needs (see paragraph 10 above)."

The absence of a lift must have impaired the applicant ’ s family ’ s quality of life, particularly that of his son.

It further lays down conditions which the citizen must meet in order to demonstrate that he or she is buying his or her first real property in order to meet his or her housing needs. In this connection, one of the conditions laid down under subsection (9.5) is that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not have another real property (flat or house) meeting their housing needs; and subsection (9.6) also provides that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not own a flat, a holiday house, or property of a significant value (other property of a significant value can include a piece of land where construction is allowed) or a business premises where the citizen or his or her immediate family members do not exercise a registered [business] activity, whereby the value of the real property is similar to that of the real property (flat or house) which the citizen is purchasing.",
                "Given the rationale of the cited provisions and the facts of the case as established beyond doubt during the proceedings, [the Ministry] considers that the first-instance authority was justified in rejecting the appellant ’ s request for tax exemption ... The right to tax exemption exists if the citizen, or his or her immediate family members, at the time of purchase [of the real property], do not own, or did not own, another real property meeting their housing needs or a flat, a holiday house or other real property of a significant value. As this is not the situation in the present case, given that the appellant, at the time of purchase [of the house], owned a flat in Zagreb ... larger than the real property he was buying and in respect of which he sought tax exemption, it cannot be said that by buying the house the appellant was purchasing his first real property in order to meet his housing needs.”"

It is helpful to mainstream accessibility standards that prescribe various areas that have to be accessible, such as the physical environment in laws on construction and planning, transportation in laws on public aerial, railway, road and water transport, information and communication, and services open to the public. However, accessibility should be encompassed in general and specific laws on equal opportunities, equality and participation in the context of the prohibition of disability-based discrimination. Denial of access should be clearly defined as a prohibited act of discrimination. Persons with disabilities who have been denied access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication, or services open to the public should have effective legal remedies at their disposal. When defining accessibility standards, States parties have to take into account the diversity of persons with disabilities and ensure that accessibility is provided to persons of any gender and of all ages and types of disability. Part of the task of encompassing the diversity of persons with disabilities in the provision of accessibility is recognizing that some persons with disabilities need human or animal assistance in order to enjoy full accessibility (such as personal assistance, sign language interpretation, tactile sign language interpretation or guide dogs). It must be stipulated, for example, that banning guide dogs from entering a particular building or open space would constitute a prohibited act of disability-based discrimination.”",

For the purposes of the Covenant, ‘ disability-based discrimination ’ may be defined as including any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, or denial of reasonable accommodation based on disability which has the effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of economic, social or cultural rights. Through neglect, ignorance, prejudice and false assumptions, as well as through exclusion, distinction or separation, persons with disabilities have very often been prevented from exercising their economic, social or cultural rights on an equal basis with persons without disabilities.

He had thus failed to use the effective domestic remedies concerning the allegations of discrimination. The Government conceded that the Constitutional Court had not declared the applicant ’ s constitutional complaint inadmissible for non-exhaustion of remedies, but they considered, without elaborating further on the matter, that the provision on exhaustion of remedies under the Constitutional Court Act had a different scope and meaning from the rule on exhaustion of remedies under the Convention.

At all events, the Constitutional Court had not declared his constitutional complaint inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, which suggested that he had properly exhausted the relevant remedies before the administrative authorities.

The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of his or her Convention grievances. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Vučković and Others v.

Further conditions, such as value of the previously owned property (section 11(9.6) of the Real Property Transfer Act), had had no bearing in the domestic authorities ’ assessment of his case.

The authorities had thus discriminated against him by failing to interpret the term “property that satisfies a family ’ s housing needs” in a way that took into consideration the accessibility of the property in question. This discriminatory treatment, in the applicant ’ s view, had no reasonable justification, particularly given that the problem of accessibility impeded his son ’ s ability to leave the flat, thereby restricting all his other rights, such as those to adequate health treatment, education and personal development.

In the case in issue, the applicant had failed to meet two conditions. Firstly, the flat he had owned at the time when he had bought the house objectively satisfied the requirements for adequate housing for him and his family. It had basic infrastructure and satisfied hygiene and technical requirements, and the tax authorities had no discretion in assessing the term “housing needs”. In the Government ’ s view, the tax authorities were neither equipped nor competent to objectively assess the numerous specific housing needs of persons who sought tax exemption. With regard to the second condition, the Government submitted that the applicant had not met the value requirement in that he had owned a flat of significant value. Therefore, the fact that the building was not equipped with a lift had been irrelevant. It was in fact the intention of the relevant domestic law to provide tax exemption in order to assist individuals who were buying their first real property, and in particular those without property of significant value. In the case in issue, the domestic authorities had acted within their margin of appreciation, and had accordingly assessed that the applicant did not need any such financial assistance, which had led them to dismiss his request for tax exemption.

With regard, in particular, to the tax exemptions set out in the Real Property Transfer Act, the Government stressed that the positive measures implemented by the State were primarily aimed at financially disadvantaged individuals and that they could not address the needs of all vulnerable groups.

The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, §§ 47-48, 22 January 2008, and Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 63, ECHR 2010)."

On the one hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy, for example (see Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 109, ECHR 2014). This also includes measures in the area of taxation. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality (see R.Sz. v. Hungary, no. 41838/11, § 54, 2 July 2013). On the other hand, if a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State ’ s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question. The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs. The Court has already identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their characteristic or status, including disability (see Glor, cited above, § 84; Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 63, ECHR 2011). Moreover, with regard to all actions concerning children with disabilities the best interest of the child must be a primary consideration (see paragraph 34 above; Article 7 § 2 of the CRPD). In any case, however, irrespective of the scope of the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court (see, inter alia, Konstantin Markin v.

The Court further observes that the applicant alleged discriminatory treatment in the application of the domestic real property tax legislation in comparison to other persons purchasing real property in order to meet their housing needs, under circumstances where the property which they owned fell short of the housing needs of their families. In particular, the applicant contended that by selling his flat, situated on the third floor of a residential building in Zagreb, and moving to a house in Samobor, he had for the first time created housing conditions suited to his family ’ s situation after the birth of his disabled child. This specifically relates to the fact that the residential building in which the flat was located was not equipped with a lift, making it increasingly difficult, as his son grew, for the applicant and his family to take him out of the flat to see a doctor, or to take him for physiotherapy and to kindergarten or school, and to meet his other social needs (see paragraph 10 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, there can be no question that the applicant ’ s flat in Zagreb, which he had bought three years before the birth of his son, situated on the third floor of a residential building without a lift, severely impaired his son ’ s mobility and consequently threatened his personal development and ability to reach his maximum potential, making it extremely difficult for him to participate fully in the community and the educational, cultural and social activities available for children. The absence of a lift must have impaired the applicant ’ s family ’ s quality of life, particularly that of his son. The latter ’ s situation might be compared to that of an able-bodied person who, for example, had a flat on the third floor of a residential building without appropriate access to it, or had limited access to the necessary relevant public amenities."

His situation nevertheless differed with regard to the meaning of the term “basic infrastructure requirements” which, in view of his son ’ s disability and the relevant national and international standards on the matter (see paragraphs 25 and 34-42 above), necessitated access to facilities such as, in the instant case, a lift."

Accordingly, he was denied a tax exemption for the purchase of a property meeting the housing needs of his family, disregarding the applicant ’ s arguments concerning his family ’ s specific needs arising out of his child ’ s disability (see paragraphs 11-12 above)."

Also under Article 14 of the Convention, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions of international and European law and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved. In that connection, the Court notes the importance of the fundamental principles of universality and non-discrimination in the exercise of the right to education, which are enshrined in many international texts. It further emphasises that those international instruments have recognised inclusive education as the most appropriate means of guaranteeing the aforementioned fundamental principles, as such education is geared to promoting equal opportunities for all, including persons with disabilities ( see Çam, cited above, § 64, and the references therein ). Inclusive education indubitably forms part of the States ’ international responsibility in this sphere.",

Such accommodation is geared to correcting factual inequalities ( see paragraph 61 above ), and discrimination on grounds of disability “ includes all forms of discrimination, including denial of reasonable accommodation ” ( see paragraph 25 above; and see, mutatis mutandis, Çam, cited above, §§ 65 and 67, and Şanlısoy v.

Similarly, the Court itself has ruled that the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom, which necessarily includes a person ’ s freedom to make his or her own choices ( see Pretty, cited above, §§ 61 and 65; Mółka, decision cited above; and McDonald, cited above, § 47)."

Relying on Article 42 of the Constitution, section 15 of Law no. 5378 on persons with disabilities and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, he affirmed that it was the State ’ s duty to guarantee the citizens ’ right to education, in line with the principle of equal opportunities. He further alleged that the faculty ’ s reply to his request ( see paragraph 8 above ) had been intended solely to induce him to abandon his studies.",
                "4. The administration replied to that formal notice by letter of 10 September 2007.

It explained that the only reason why the applicant ’ s participation in the practical workshops had previously been described as problematic ( see paragraph 8 above ) was that such workshops necessitated a considerable physical effort and that his particular situation required some thought regarding the type of assistance with which he could be provided. Furthermore, all the parties involved were anxious to help students in difficulty, and there was no question of deterring the applicant from continuing his studies. Finally, the Administration pointed out that since, in its view, the budget allocated by the State was limited, the redevelopment work necessitated by the applicant ’ s situation was subject to unavoidable budgetary and time constraints.",

Moreover, he argued that the redevelopment work requested was such as should already have been conducted in any case, in line with the requirements of section 1 bis of Law no. 3194 on urban planning ( see paragraph 23 above ). Furthermore, he considered that the authorities ’ offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. He added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy.

Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 136 and 137, ECHR 2005 XI). In other words, access to any institution of higher education existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right set out in the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 ( see, inter alia, Mürsel Eren v.

He submitted that that violation had, furthermore, persisted until the authorities had taken the requisite action in the institution in question to remove the obstacles to his access to education, that is to say, as contended by the Government, until 2010-2011. The applicant considered, in that connection, that from the 2007-2008 academic year until the 2010 ‑ 2011 academic year he had found it physically impossible to resume his studies because he had had no means of accessing the rooms in which the classes were being held."

Such accommodation is geared to correcting factual inequalities ( see paragraph 61 above ), and discrimination on grounds of disability “ includes all forms of discrimination, including denial of reasonable accommodation ” ( see paragraph 25 above; and see, mutatis mutandis, Çam, cited above, §§ 65 and 67, and Şanlısoy v.

In that regard, the Court will not dwell on the abstract promise of assistance which the faculty claimed to be able to provide to the applicant, as far as possible, or on the expression of concern about the demanding nature of the courses administered in the workshops; the statements comprise no practical, assessable proposal.",

Similarly, the Court itself has ruled that the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom, which necessarily includes a person ’ s freedom to make his or her own choices ( see Pretty, cited above, §§ 61 and 65; Mółka, decision cited above; and McDonald, cited above, § 47)."

However, the solution offered by the administration does not fit into this framework because there is nothing in the case-file to convince the Court that the support in question was offered after a genuine assessment of the applicant ’ s needs and sincere consideration of its potential effects on his security, dignity and autonomy."

Pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, it had been primarily incumbent on that court to enforce the rights in issue, verifying, in particular, whether the applicant ’ s educational needs and the authorities ’ limited capacity for meeting them had been weighed against each other, that is to say whether a fair balance had been struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole ( see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003-VIII : Vučković and Others v.

Essentially, the administrative judges, while vaguely acknowledging that the authorities ought to have applied the guidelines on persons with disabilities, quite simply exempted the respondent faculty from its duty to cater for the applicant, on the sole grounds that its building had been erected in 1988, before the guidelines had come into force.",

In so doing the court also refrained ( see paragraph 71 in fine above ) from seeking to identify the applicant ’ s real needs and the ways and means of meeting them, with a view to enabling Mr Enver Şahin to resume his studies under conditions as similar as possible to those provided for able-bodied students, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden on the authorities.",

Therefore, in its further analysis the Court shall take into account the specific position of the Roma population. The Court has noted in previous cases that as a result of their history, the Roma have become a specific type of disadvantaged and vulnerable minority (see also the general observations in the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Recommendation No. 1203 (1993) on Gypsies in Europe, cited in paragraph 81 above, and point 4 of its Recommendation No. 1557 (2002) on the legal situation of Roma in Europe, cited in paragraph 8 3 above). They therefore require special protection. As is attested by the activities of numerous European and international organisations and the recommendations of the Council of Europe bodies, this protection also extends to the sphere of education. The present case therefore warrants particular attention, especially as when the applications were lodged with the Court the applicants were minor children for whom the right to education was of paramount importance (see D.H. and Others, cited above, § 182 )."

The Croatian authorities have sought to tackle the problem. However, in their attempts to achieve the social and educational integration of the disadvantaged group which the Roma form, they have had to contend with numerous difficulties as a result of, inter alia, the cultural specificities of that minority and an alleged degree of hostility on the part of the parents of non-Roma children. As the Grand Chamber noted in the above - mentioned D.H. and Others judgment, the choice of the best means to address learning difficulties of children lacking proficiency of the language of instruction is not an easy one. It entails a difficult balancing exercise between the competing interests.

The [first-instance] court considered that this practice respected the integrity of a class and its unity in the upper grades.",

                "‘ The [defendant schools] enrolled in the first year those children found psycho-physically fit to attend primary school by a committee composed of a physician, a psychologist, a school counsellor [ pedagog ], a defectologist and a teacher. They did not enrol Croatian children or Roma children as such, but children found by the said committee to be psychologically and physically fit to be enrolled in primary school. ... The defendant primary schools maintain that the first obstacle for Roma children in psychological tests is their lack of knowledge of the Croatian language in terms of both expression and comprehension. As to the emotional aspect of maturity, most of these children have difficulty channelling their emotions. In terms of social maturity, children of Roma origin do not have the basic hygienic skills of washing, dressing, tying or buttoning, and a lot of time is needed before they achieve these skills. ... It is therefore difficult to plan lessons with sufficient motivation for all children, which is one of the obligations of primary schools. There are classes composed of pupils not requiring additional schooling to follow the teaching programme and classes composed of pupils who require supplementary work and assistance from teachers in order to acquire the necessary [skills] they lack owing to social deprivation. ... ’",
                "The reasoning of the same judgment cites the testimony of M.P.-P., a school counsellor and psychologist at Macinec Primary School, given on 12 December 2001 ...;",
                "‘ Before enrolment the committee questions the children in order to establish whether they possess the skills necessary for attending school. Classes are usually formed according to the Gauss curve, so that the majority in a given class are average pupils and a minority below or above average. ... However, in a situation where 70% of the population does not speak Croatian, a different approach is adopted so as to form classes with only pupils who do not speak Croatian, because in those classes a teacher ’ s first task is to teach the children the language. ’",
                "The above shows that the allocation of pupils to classes is based on the skills and needs of each individual child. The approach is individualised and carried out in keeping with professional and pedagogical standards. Thus, the Constitutional Court finds the approach applied correct since only qualified experts, in particular in the fields of pedagogy, school psychology and defectology, are responsible for assigning individual children to the appropriate classes.",
                "The Constitutional Court has no reason to question the findings and expert opinions of the competent committees, composed of physicians, psychologists, school counsellors [ pedagog ], defectologists and teachers, which in the instant case found that the complainants should be placed in separate classes.",
                "None of the facts submitted to the Constitutional Court leads to the conclusion that the placement of the complainants in separate classes was motivated by or based on their racial or ethnic origin.",
                "The Constitutional Court finds that their placement pursued the legitimate aim of necessary adjustment of the primary educational system to the skills and needs of the complainants, where the decisive factor was their lack of knowledge or inadequate knowledge of Croatian, the language used to teach in schools.",
                "The separate classes were not established for the purpose of racial segregation in enrolment in the first year of primary school but as a means of providing children with supplementary tuition in the Croatian language and eliminating the consequences of prior social deprivation.",
                "It is of particular importance to stress that the statistical data on the number of Roma children in separate classes in the school year 2001 / 02 ... are not in themselves sufficient to indicate that the defendants ’ practice was discriminatory (see also the European Court of Human Rights judgments Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, § 154, 4 May 2001, and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 57325/00, § 46, 7 February 2006 ).",
                "Moreover, the complainants themselves maintain in their constitutional complaint that in the school year 2001 / 02 40.93% of Roma children in Međimurje County were placed in regular classes, which tends to support the Constitutional Court ’ s conclusion that there is no reason to challenge the correct practice of the defendant primary schools and expert committees.",

An investigation should be carried out into the role of stereotypes and prejudices of teachers, which may lead to low expectations for Roma/Gypsy children. ECRI recommends, in this respect, that training be offered to teachers, including information about the particular needs and expectations of Roma/Gypsies and the ability to use this knowledge effectively. As insufficient knowledge of the Croatian language upon entry to classes may also present an obstacle, ECRI emphasises the importance of preparatory classes, additional training in the Croatian language and increased opportunities to study the Roma language in the early years of schooling, which might assist Roma/Gypsy children in integrating into the educational system. ECRI notes with interest initiatives such as the “ Programme for Including Roma children in the Education System of the Republic of Croatia ”, launched in 1998, and encourages the authorities in their efforts to continue to develop and implement appropriate measures in cooperation with Roma associations.

ECRI is pleased to learn that in October 2003 the government adopted a national programme for the Roma which aims to resolve many of the difficulties encountered by Roma in their day-to-day lives. The programme is based on the observation that Roma are largely marginalised in social and public activities and experience worse living conditions than the average majority population and other minorities. The programme aims to abolish all forms of discrimination, violence, stereotyping and prejudice against Roma, while ensuring that they do not lose their own identity, culture or traditions. In order to achieve this aim, the programme sets out a series of measures in areas such as access to citizenship, education, housing, access to public services and relations with the police. In 2004, a commission made up of government representatives, Roma and NGO [non-governmental organisation] representatives was set up to monitor the programme and develop a joint action plan for the different ministries. A number of measures have already been taken, such as the training of Roma as assistants in schools or as police officers and the training of young Roma at seminars on participation in public life. ... However, implementation of the programme has not really got off the ground yet and NGOs are critical of the lack of budgetary resources provided, though these are essential to the success of such a programme. The programme must be regarded as positive, although in ECRI ’ s view it does not sufficiently emphasise the part played by stereotyping and prejudice against Roma, both among the population and among representatives of the public authorities, in the difficulties encountered by this community.

The authorities have taken measures to facilitate Roma children ’ s access to education, such as setting up nursery school classes enabling them to learn Croatian, training teachers in Roma culture and training young Roma as assistants in schools. Some Roma now receive State grants to enrol in university. However, as they are very recent and applied on a small scale these measures are not enough to offset the fact that Roma children are very much behind in terms of equal opportunities in education. Many Roma children leave school at a very early age. They do not always have access to education in their mother tongue and their own culture in schools, in spite of the legislation on the rights of national minorities which provides for this possibility. The authorities have explained to ECRI that this is because the Roma have not asked for it themselves and because the Romani language is not standardised, with several Romani dialects in Croatia. However, some Roma representatives have expressed the wish that the school curriculum for Roma children should include teaching of their mother tongue and Roma culture, though they also emphasise the importance of learning Croatian.",

According to several NGOs, including the European Roma Rights Centre, education in the classes set aside for Roma children is of poorer quality than in the other classes. According to the authorities, however, the sole reason why there are still classes comprising only Roma children is the de facto segregation which they face where housing is concerned, since Roma are sometimes in the majority in some areas. Nevertheless, this explanation does not provide a response to allegations that when the authorities tried to introduce mixed classes instead of separate classes in some schools, they came up against opposition from the non-Roma parents, who apparently signed petitions against this measure, with the result that the separate classes were maintained. ECRI notes that proceedings for racial segregation are pending before the national courts in this connection.",

The Advisory Committee finds it important that this commitment increases the vigour with which sectoral projects for Roma, such as the ones in the field of education (see also comments under Article 12), are pursued and leads to the development, in consultations with Roma, of more comprehensive programmes and strategies to address the concerns of this national minority.",

The Advisory Committee stresses that placing children in separate classes should take place only when it is absolutely necessary and always on the basis of consistent, objective and comprehensive tests. The Advisory Committee supports the efforts of the office of the Ombudsman to review this situation with a view to ensuring that Roma children have equal access to, and opportunities to continue to attend, regular classes. The Advisory Committee is aware of the reservations expressed by some Roma with respect to the integration of Roma pupils into regular classes and supports efforts to involve Roma parents and Roma organisations in the process aimed at remedying the current situation.

I sincerely hope there will be no recurrence of the events which took place in the past, and it is imperative to guarantee that the social and ethnic mix is maintained for the sake of having Roma and non-Roma children educated together in the same classes.",

I would stress the importance of putting all pupils through the same syllabus and the same teaching process in one class. Nonetheless, the knowledge gap problem is not to be evaded. As a remedy to it, it could be useful to set up at national level pre-school classes for children whose mother tongue is not Croatian. That way, they will acquire a sufficient grounding in the Croatian language to be able to keep up with the primary school courses later, while at the same time familiarising themselves with the school institution. In the second place, it rests with the parents to ensure the sound learning of the language and their children ’ s regular attendance for the entire school course.”",

                "73. In the third section of the report, which concerns discrimination in education, the Commissioner for Human Rights noted that the fact that a significant number of Roma children did not have access to education of a similar standard to that enjoyed by other children was in part a result of discriminatory practices and prejudices. In that connection, he noted that segregation in education was a common feature in many Council of Europe member States. In some countries there were segregated schools in segregated settlements, in others special classes for Roma children in ordinary schools. Being subjected to special schools or classes often meant that these children followed a curriculum inferior to those of mainstream classes, which diminished their opportunities of further education and finding employment in the future. At the same time, segregated education denied both Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens. It excluded Roma children from mainstream society at the very beginning of their lives, increasing the risk of their being caught in the vicious circle of marginalisation."

                "74. It was also noted that special classes or special curricula for Roma had been introduced with good intentions, for the purposes of overcoming language barriers or remedying the lack of pre-school attendance of Roma children. Evidently, it was necessary to respond to such challenges, but segregation or systematic placement of Roma children in classes which followed a simplified or a special Romani-language curriculum while isolating them from other pupils was clearly a distorted response. Instead of segregation, significant emphasis had to be placed on measures such as pre-school and in-school educational and linguistic support as well as the provision of school assistants to work alongside teachers. In certain communities, it was crucial to raise the awareness of Roma parents – who themselves might not have had the possibility to attend school – of the necessity and benefits of adequate education for their children."
            ],
            [
                "75. In conclusion, the Commissioner made a number of recommendations related to education. Where segregated education still existed in one form or another, it had to be replaced by ordinary integrated education and, where appropriate, banned through legislation. Adequate resources had to be made available for the provision of pre-school education, language training and school assistant training in order to ensure the success of desegregation efforts. Adequate assessment had to be made before children were placed in special classes, in order to ensure that the sole criterion in the placement was the objective needs of the child, not his or her ethnicity."

It follows that the central question to be addressed in the present case is whether adequate steps were taken by the school authorities to ensure the applicants ’ speedy progress in acquiring an adequate command of Croatian and, once this was achieved, their immediate integration into mixed classes. In this connection, the curriculum followed by the applicants and the procedures concerning their transfer to mixed classes appear of high importance.

Therefore, in its further analysis the Court shall take into account the specific position of the Roma population. The Court has noted in previous cases that as a result of their history, the Roma have become a specific type of disadvantaged and vulnerable minority (see also the general observations in the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Recommendation No. 1203 (1993) on Gypsies in Europe, cited in paragraph 81 above, and point 4 of its Recommendation No. 1557 (2002) on the legal situation of Roma in Europe, cited in paragraph 8 3 above). They therefore require special protection. As is attested by the activities of numerous European and international organisations and the recommendations of the Council of Europe bodies, this protection also extends to the sphere of education. The present case therefore warrants particular attention, especially as when the applications were lodged with the Court the applicants were minor children for whom the right to education was of paramount importance (see D.H. and Others, cited above, § 182 )."

In Chapman, the Court also observed that there could be said to be an emerging international consensus among the member States of the Council of Europe recognising the special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle, not only for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the minorities themselves but to preserve a cultural diversity of value to the whole community (see D.H. and Others, cited above, § 181).",

Germany, no. 59140/00, § 33, 25 October 2005 ). However, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them; indeed, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14 (see the ‘ Belgian linguistic ’ case, cited above, p. 34, § 10; Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 51, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI ). Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. However, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference of treatment based exclusively on the ground of ethnic origin as compatible with the Convention (see Timishev, cited above, § 56 )."

The Court has also accepted that a general policy or measure which is apparently neutral but has disproportionately prejudicial effects on persons or groups of persons who, as for instance in the present case, are identifiable only on the basis of an ethnic criterion, may be considered discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed at that group (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, § 154, 4 May 2001; Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 58461/00, 6 January 2005; and Sampanis and Others, cited above, § 68 ), unless that measure is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate, necessary and proportionate. Furthermore, discrimination potentially contrary to the Convention may result from a de facto situation (see Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, § 76, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII ). Where an applicant produces prima facie evidence that the effect of a measure or practice is discriminatory, the burden of proof will shift on to the respondent State, to whom it falls to show that the difference in treatment is not discriminatory (see D.H. and Others, cited above, § § 180 and 189)."

The D.H. and Others judgment concerned a situation where a nationwide practice of placing a disproportionate number of Roma children in schools for pupils with learning difficulties amounted to discrimination based on the applicants ’ ethnic origin. In Sampanis and Others the Court found that the practice of first denying Roma children enrolment in school and their subsequent placement in special classes located in an annex to the main building of a primary school, coupled with a number of racist incidents in the school instigated by the parents of non-Roma children, also amounted to discrimination based on the applicants ’ Roma origin."

The present case is to be distinguished from the above two cases, in particular regarding the relevance of the statistics in the three cases, which could have a bearing on whether there is prima facie evidence of discrimination and consequently on the burden of proof. In D.H. and Others (cited above, § 18) the Court established that between 50 % and 70% of Roma children in the Czech Republic attended special schools for pupils with learning difficulties, while in Sampanis and Others (cited above, § 81) all Roma children attending the school at issue were allocated to a separate establishment. As to the present case, the Court firstly notes that the applicants, unlike in the Sampanis and Others case, attended regular primary schools and that the Roma-only classes were situated in the same premises as other classes. The proportion of Roma children in the lower grades in Macinec Primary School varies from 57 % to 75%, while in Podturen Primary School it varies from 33 % to 36%. The data submitted for the year 2001 show that in Macinec Primary School 44% of pupils were Roma and 73% of those attended a Roma-only class. In Podturen Primary School 10% of pupils were Roma and 36% of Roma pupils attended a Roma-only class. These statistics demonstrate that only in Macinec Primary School did a majority of Roma pupils attend a Roma-only class, while in Podturen Primary School the percentage was below 50%. This confirms that it was not a general policy to automatically place Roma pupils in separate classes in both schools at issue. Therefore, the statistics submitted do not suffice to establish that there is prima facie evidence that the effect of a measure or practice was discriminatory."

It is equally improbable that it should have taken two years for their respective class teachers to note the applicants ’ insufficient command of the language.

The Court also refers to the Opinion on Croatia of the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, adopted on 1 October 2004, according to which “pupils should not be placed in such separate remedial classes on the basis of their affiliation with a national minority but rather on the basis of the skills and needs of the individuals concerned, and where such placing is found necessary, it should be for a limited period only” (see paragraph 70 above)."

However, no particular monitoring procedure was in place. Although some of the applicants at times attended mixed classes, the Government failed to show that any individual reports were drawn up in respect of each applicant and his or her progress in learning Croatian. Such reports appear necessary in order to ensure objectivity as well as to identify problem areas which could then be addressed, if needed, with additional measures.

In the second ECRI report on Croatia, published on 3 July 2001, it is stated that “many Roma/Gypsy children do not go to school, having either dropped out or having never attended” (see paragraph 66 above). This observation was confirmed in the third ECRI report on Croatia, published on 14 June 2005, according to which “ [ m ] any Roma children leave school at a very early age” (see paragraph 67 above). The statistics submitted by the applicants for Međimurje County and not refuted by the Government show a drop-out rate of 84% for Roma pupils before completing primary education. The applicants in the present case, without exception, left school at the age of 15 without completing primary education. Their school reports show poor attendance."

While the Croatian authorities cannot be held to be the only ones responsible for the fact that so many pupils failed to complete primary education or to attain an adequate level of language proficiency, such a high drop-out rate of Roma pupils in Međimurje County called for the implementation of positive measures in order, inter alia, to raise awareness of the importance of education among the Roma population and to assist the applicants with any difficulties they encountered in following the school curriculum. Therefore, some additional steps were needed in order to address these problems, such as active and structured involvement on the part of the relevant social services. However, according to the Government, the social services had been informed of the pupil ’ s poor attendance only in the case of the fifth applicant.

However, under the Court ’ s case-law, the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention – in so far as such a waiver is permissible – must be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent ( see Pfeifer and Plankl v.

The Croatian authorities have sought to tackle the problem. However, in their attempts to achieve the social and educational integration of the disadvantaged group which the Roma form, they have had to contend with numerous difficulties as a result of, inter alia, the cultural specificities of that minority and an alleged degree of hostility on the part of the parents of non-Roma children. As the Grand Chamber noted in the above - mentioned D.H. and Others judgment, the choice of the best means to address learning difficulties of children lacking proficiency of the language of instruction is not an easy one. It entails a difficult balancing exercise between the competing interests. As to the setting and planning of the curriculum, this mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule ( see D.H. and Others, cited above, § 205, and Valsamis v.

Furthermore, as a result of the arrangements the applicants were placed in separate classes where an adapted curriculum was followed, though its exact content remains unclear.

Although all expenses were covered by the Government, only three of the applicants availed themselves of this opportunity, and only one actually completed the evening school.
