The Commission was therefore quite right in declaring in various circumstances that there was a need for a certain flexibility in the application of the rule (see, for example, the decision of 30th August 1958 on the admissibility of application No. 332/57, Lawless v.

In this way he came into contact with Ringeisen to whom he advanced, in November 1958 and January 1959, 150,000 AS in several instalments. At the time of this transaction, Ringeisen mentioned to Widmann that he needed this money for a Mr. Wenger but Widmann did not meet him. At Ringeisen ’ s instigation, a contract was signed in 1959 naming the couple Widmann as creditors and the couple Wenger, amongst others, as debtors. Subsequently, Ringeisen repaid 72,000 AS to Widmann. Also in 1959 and 1960, Ringeisen negotiated in the name of Mrs. Gertrud Wenger a loan of 11,000 AS from one Rudolf Schamberger."

These powers of attorney were granted in consideration of a loan made by Ringeisen to the Roth couple and enabled him to act in their name in dividing up and selling, leasing and encumbering land which they owned at Alkoven and was entered in the Annaberg Land Register, Upper Austria. As part of the same transaction Ringeisen was given an option to purchase the property; at the same time the Roth couple undertook that, in the event of Ringeisen exercising the option and of approval of the transfer of ownership to him being refused by the competent administrative body, they would not sell the property to anyone else, would refrain from acting as owners, and would grant Ringeisen the right of exclusive occupation (letters of 3rd, 14th and 16th November 1961)."

Referring to applications which Ringeisen had made for the approval of the purchase by him from the Roth couple of other properties and which had been refused, the District Commission considered that the files revealed clearly a picture of speculation in land. It also observed that Ringeisen had already marked out thirty-four plots for building. In conclusion, the District Commission remarked that, while fear of certain intentions on the part of a purchaser was sufficient under Section 6 of the Act for refusal of approval, the fact that in this case there was clearevidence that such intentions existed must carry even more weight."

The purchasers were informed at the time by Ringeisen that permission had been obtained for building and were assured that work could begin at once. The purchase contracts drawn up by Ringeisen ’ s lawyer included a clause stating that the Real Property Transactions Commission ’ s approval was necessary to implement them, but Ringeisen had informed the purchasers that this was a mere formality. The last twenty or so purchase contracts were not concluded through the same lawyer and did not contain that particular clause. In all cases the purchase price was payable immediately.",

For this and various other reasons, it was to be feared that he would withdraw land from agricultural use on a large scale without adequate reason and that he intended to make a speculative capital investment (Section 6 (d) and (e) of the Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act)."

In support of his challenge, Ringeisen relied on Section 7 of the 1950 General Administrative Procedure Act ( Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz ) which provides in sub-section 1 as follows:",
                "\"(1) Administrative official ( Verwaltungsorgane ) shall refrain from performing their duties and shall delegate their functions:",

These allegations proved, however, to be unfounded. In its decision, which dealt at length with the allegations made, the Regional Commission found, in particular, that the approval which Mr. T. had mentioned concerned in fact the sale of different property owned by the Roth couple.",

In the light of enquiries it had caused to be made, it found that, in all, two hundred and nine building sites had been marked out on the properties in question; that Ringeisen had already concluded contracts for the sale of seventy-eight building plots and that approval of thirty-three of these contracts had been definitively refused by the Real Property Transactions authorities; that Ringeisen had encumbered the different properties with charges for substantial amounts of money and that he had made contradictory statements in his different applications for approval. The Regional Commission held that Ringeisen ’ s plans were incompatible with the principles enunciated in Section 4 (1) of the Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act as it was to be feared that more than half of the various properties in question were to be sold for building. The contract for sale of 6th February 1962 was therefore found to be designed to destroy and break up a farm which had up till then been a workable unit, to bring about the abandonment of farm buildings and to effect a resale of valuable agricultural land for profit (Section 6 of the Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act)."

For a party has no right to challenge a body competent to decide or take part in the making of the decision on the grounds of bias. A board does not cease to be competent because a biased member takes part in the proceedings. Nor does the participation of a biased member - unless a special law expressly provides otherwise - affect the proper composition of a board any more than the competence or proper composition of an authority consisting of a single person ( monokratische Behörde ) is called in question through the bias of the regularly appointed office holder ( Organwalter ).

These time-limits have already expired. It is true that several fresh complaints have been made out against the accused, but these relate mainly to the same series of facts, namely the accused ’ s actions in connection with the purchase of Mr. and Mrs. Roth ’ s property and the resale of building plots.

The request was based on the grounds that the decision for the entry of a priority notice for a contemplated charge, which Ringeisen had deposited in court on his release on 23rd December 1963, had expired on 1st October 1964 and had not been renewed; that by reason of Ringeisen ’ s \"abusive and hopeless\" litigation his creditors had been unable to avail themselves of that security while it was still valid; that enquiries had revealed that Ringeisen kept concealed considerable sums of money which he might use to abscond in view of the indictment preferred against him; that, in addition, there was a risk that the damage caused would become irreparable and, in view of Ringeisen ’ s particular pertinacity, there was a danger of his committing further offences.",

The purchasers had not been able to make any use of the priority notice up to 1st October 1964 because Michael Ringeisen through his persistent litigation made it impossible for the individual creditors to obtain execution orders. The chances of receiving reparation thus appear not merely doubtful but, as far as many creditors are concerned, quite out of the question, owing to the heavy prior encumbrances on the premises situated at No. 217, Wiener Reichstrasse.",

It is quite natural to conclude from this that the accused is keeping money hidden which, in his reaction to the charge now preferred, he could use in order to abscond .... A further consideration is that the accused ’ s real property is so encumbered that to abandon it, should he abscond, would not involve any serious loss.",

The public prosecutor opposed this application on the grounds that the reasons for detention remained valid and, as Ringeisen was in detention on remand in the other criminal proceedings, he would gain nothing by an order for his release in this case.",

                "Ringeisen appealed against this decision to the Linz Court of Appeal which decided, on 15th March 1967, that the appeal should be allowed and ordered that he should be released from detention on remand on his giving a solemn undertaking. The Court of Appeal found that Ringeisen ’ s situation had changed considerably since its decision of 2nd March 1966. After about two and a half years spent in detention on remand it could no longer be reasonably assumed that he would abscond in order to avoid prosecution, even having regard to the sentence pronounced on 18th October 1966. As to the danger of his committing further offences, the Court of Appeal observed that two charges unconnected with the Alkoven property (fraud on F. Widmann and fraudulent conversion) had been discontinued on 14th September 1966; the only count remaining was that which concerned the fraud perpetrated on the 78 purchasers of sites at Alkoven. The court had already pointed out in the decision of 2nd March 1966 that Ringeisen could no longer deal with that property. Moreover, it could be expected that the length of his detention on remand would suffice to deter Ringeisen from committing further offences, especially as he had had no previous convictions."

                "In their view, the preparatory work provided a further reason to pay special attention to the English text: the original text of Article 26 (art. 26) having been drafted in French, the English-speaking experts of a drafting sub-committee first translated the sentence by the words \"The Commission may only be petitioned after all domestic legal remedies have been exhausted ...\", which corresponded exactly to the literal meaning of the French text, and then substituted therefore the present English text, \"The Commission may only deal with the matter ...\".",

This interpretation was - they stated - the only one in conformity with the ratio legis of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, namely the protection of the States against any decision holding them responsible for a violation of an international obligation without the competent national authorities having been seized of the complaint in order to remedy the situation where necessary. This concern doubtless implied that no international verdict should be given before the final decision of the national courts but not that such a final decision must be prior in point of time to the lodging of the international application.",

Article 26 (art. 26) of the Convention refers expressly to the generally recognised rules of international law. The Commission was therefore quite right in declaring in various circumstances that there was a need for a certain flexibility in the application of the rule (see, for example, the decision of 30th August 1958 on the admissibility of application No. 332/57, Lawless v.

There is no reason why this supplement to the initial application should not relate in particular to the proof that the applicant has complied with the conditions of Article 26 (art. 26), even if he has done so after the lodging of the application.

On the contrary, it had simply intended to participate in an ongoing general debate on the protection and rearing of animals.

            [

It held that the applicant association had not provided a sufficiently detailed explanation of the nature of “the amendment of the judgment and the redress being sought”, a formal requirement imposed by section 140 of the former Federal Judicature Act (see paragraph 29 below). It observed, in particular, that the applicant association had been unable to show that redress was possible only through the reopening of the proceedings. It further noted that the association had not sufficiently shown that it still had an interest in broadcasting the original commercial, which now appeared out of date almost eight years after it was initially intended to have been broadcast. Lastly, the Federal Court considered that the fresh refusal by Publisuisse SA, the competent authority in such matters, to sign a new agreement to broadcast the commercial should have formed the subject of separate proceedings. The relevant passages of the judgment read as follows:",
                "3.1 Section 140 of the Federal Judicature Act provides that an application for review must indicate, with supporting evidence, the ground relied on for the reopening of proceedings and whether it has been raised in due time. It is not enough simply to claim that the ground exists; it is also necessary to explain why, and to what extent, the operative provisions must be amended as a result (Elisabeth Escher, ‘ Revision und Erläuterung ’, note 8.28, in Geiser/Münch, Prozessieren vor Bundesgericht, 2nd ed., Basle 1998).",
                "3.2 The application to reopen the proceedings in the instant case does not meet these formal requirements. The applicant association has sought the review of the Federal Court ’ s judgment without explaining the extent to which this is necessary following the European Court ’ s judgment of 28 June 2001. VgT evidently assumes that the Strasbourg Court ’ s decision against Switzerland in itself makes the reopening of the proceedings necessary, but that is not the case. The mere fact that the Court, ruling on an individual application, has found a violation of the Convention does not mean that the Federal Court judgment in issue must automatically be reviewed in accordance with domestic law (see judgment 2A.363/2001 of 6 November 2001 in the Boultif case, point 3a/cc; Martin Philip Wyss, ‘ EMRK-Verletzung und bundesrechtliche Revision nach Art. 139a OG ’, in recht 1999, p. 100; Schürmann, op. cit., p. 100; Hottelier, op. cit., p. 749; BBl 1991 II 465, p. 529). Being a subsidiary remedy, reopening is justified only if it appears to remain necessary notwithstanding the compensation awarded by the European Court of Human Rights and constitutes the only means of obtaining redress (see Schürmann, op. cit., p. 102; Wyss, op. cit., p. 99). The application to reopen the proceedings must give at least a broad indication of how redress may be obtained only by this means (see judgment 2A.363/2001 of 6 November 2001 in the Boultif case, point 3b/cc).",
                "Publisuisse SA evidently once again refused to conclude an advertising agreement with VgT, which appealed against the refusal to the Federal Office of Communication; the proceedings are still pending. By taking this action, VgT itself proves that it is not continuing to suffer any practical adverse effects that can only be redressed by reopening the proceedings. It does not claim that it still has an interest in having the original commercial broadcast; it is, moreover, unlikely that this is the case, since VgT ’ s primary objective is no longer (solely) to encourage a decline in meat consumption and to denounce the conditions in which animals are reared (which are also likely to have changed in the almost eight years since the commercial was intended to have been broadcast), but to publicise the Court ’ s finding of a violation of its freedom of expression. It is thus no longer the same commercial that is under discussion today. The consequences of the Convention violation committed at the time were redressed as a result of the judgment against Switzerland and the award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention; the new agreement which VgT now wishes to conclude must form the subject of separate proceedings.",
                "4.2 In its judgment of 20 August 1997, the Federal Court held that VgT ’ s commercial was subject to the public-law prohibition on political advertising set forth in section 18(5) of the Federal Radio and Television Act and could provide the Swiss Radio and Television Company, or rather Publisuisse SA, with a valid reason for not concluding the advertising agreement. The European Court of Human Rights did not share this view and held that there was no justification in a democratic society for refusing to broadcast a commercial on the ground that it constituted political advertising, which was banned on television. The Court did not express an opinion on whether and to what extent Switzerland, by not ensuring that the commercial could be broadcast, had breached any positive obligations resulting from the extension of the Convention safeguards to relations between private entities (see paragraph 46 of the Court ’ s judgment ). The subject of the Federal Court ’ s judgment was the finding by the authorities that VgT ’ s commercial could be considered ‘ political ’ within the meaning of the Radio and Television Act and that the refusal to broadcast it could be justified on this public-law ground alone. The judgment did not deal with the question whether the Swiss Radio and Television Company had boycotted VgT, whether the company dominated the advertising market and whether, on that account, it would have been under an obligation to conclude an advertising agreement. These (civil law) aspects of an obligation to contract must be addressed in the appropriate form of civil proceedings (concerning cartel law, competition law or the general law relating to personality rights ) and not under the law governing trading licences. This argument, which Switzerland put forward, was not contested by the European Court.",
                "4.3 In this connection, by enacting the relevant (civil) legislation and establishing judicial remedies to implement it, Switzerland has complied with its positive obligation under Article 10 of the Convention to ensure the appropriate realisation among private entities of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. The rules of competition and cartel law or the possibility of asserting a civil-law obligation to contract are intended to encourage a means of implementing fundamental rights that is fair and strikes a balance between the various interests at stake in the sphere of economic relations between private entities. VgT is free to use this legal remedy in seeking to have its commercial broadcast, provided that, contrary to what has been said above, it still has a real interest in the broadcast; in that eventuality, due regard will have to be had in the proceedings to its constitutional rights and the principles enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention (see Article 35 of the Federal Constitution). The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights does not conflict with this view; however, all that can be inferred from the judgment is that the classification of the commercial as ‘ political advertising ’ did not justify refusing to broadcast it, or that the broadcasting of the commercial by the Swiss Radio and Television Company, on the basis of Article 10 of the Convention, should not have had any consequences for the broadcaster under the law relating to trading licences. The Swiss Radio and Television Company rightly points out that the judgment cannot be construed as requiring it to broadcast the commercial in issue in breach of the existing legal rules (such as the provisions of the Federal Unfair Competition Act), since the European Court did not address the corresponding questions, limited itself to examining the issue of ‘ political ’ advertising and did not state any position on the Swiss Radio and Television Company ’ s ‘ negative ’ freedom of expression. Since the Court ’ s judgment simply finds that the prohibition of political advertising on television must not stand in the way of broadcasting the commercial, VgT must seek to have it broadcast through recourse to the civil courts and not through the reopening procedure, should the Swiss Radio and Television Company, or rather Publisuisse SA, still refuse to broadcast it (see Ulrike Preissler, Die Zulässigkeit ideeller Werbung im Fernsehen, dissertation, Bonn 1994, pp. 113 et seq.; Martin Dumeruth, ‘ Rundfunkrecht ’, in Koller/Müller/Rhinow/ Zimmerli (eds.), Schweizerisches Bundesverwaltungsrecht, Basle 1996, note 126; Rolf H. Weiss, ‘ Rechtliche Grundlagen für Werbung und Sponsoring ’, in SMI 1993, pp. 213 et seq., in particular p. 226, footnote 58).",
                "4.4 The Swiss Radio and Television Company cannot be directly ordered to broadcast the commercial in issue, since the Federal Court has no power in public law to give such an order. The applicant association had requested the Federal Office of Communication to issue a declaratory order to the effect that, under Article 10 of the Convention, VgT was entitled to have its commercial broadcast ( ‘ right to broadcast advertising ’ ). The Federal Court acknowledged from a procedural point of view that a right to have such an order issued existed (section 25 of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention ) but ruled in the instant case – wrongly in the European Court ’ s view – on the basis of section 18(5) of the Federal Radio and Television Act that there was no right of access to television for political advertising. If the Federal Court had decided in the same way as the European Court, it would have had to limit itself to finding that the Swiss Radio and Television Company had not been entitled to refuse to broadcast the commercial on the ground that it was political in nature, or rather that reliance on this ground for the refusal was contrary to Article 10 of the Convention. On the other hand, given the lack of legal basis, the Federal Court could not have ordered the Swiss Radio and Television Company to broadcast the commercial in the context of proceedings governed by broadcasting legislation (see Dumermuth, op. cit., note 491). VgT is now seeking such an order solely by way of the reopening procedure, but it cannot obtain it in relation to the decision to be reviewed. The Federal Court cannot make an order, following a judgment of the Strasbourg Court, that it was not empowered to make in the original proceedings (see judgment 2A.232/2000 of 2 March 2001 in the Amann case, point 3b/bb, published in EuGRZ 2001, p. 322)."

Having been parties to the proceedings that resulted in the impugned judgment, the applicants have locus standi. The judgment became final on 13 March 2008; the application has therefore been lodged in time. The application also states the ground relied on for reopening the proceedings and the nature of the amendment of the judgment being sought; it should therefore be considered on the merits.",
                "The submission that the Confederation should be ordered to pay the applicants the sums awarded by the European Court in respect of non-pecuniary damage and costs and expenses cannot, however, be dealt with in the present review proceedings. Accordingly, it is inadmissible.",
                "2. The basis in section 122 of the Federal Court Act for reopening the proceedings is subject to several conditions. Thus, an individual application must have been upheld by the European Court in a final judgment finding a violation of a right guaranteed by the Convention ( subsection ( a ) ); compensation cannot remedy the effects of the violation ( subsection (b) ); and the review must be necessary to remedy the effects of the violation ( subsection ( c) ). The conditions laid down in this provision are similar to those which applied under the Federal Judicature Act (section 139 ( a ) ), with the result that, in principle, the case-law under the previous legislation retains its full force.",
                "2.1 In the instant case the European Court found that the severing of the mother-child relationship following the child ’ s adoption by her mother ’ s partner constituted, in the particular circumstances of the case, unjustified interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for family life and, on that account, a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The European Court ’ s judgment has, moreover, been final since 13 March 2008 (section 122 (a) of the Federal Court Act). Furthermore, it is clear that no award of compensation can afford redress for the loss of the mother-child relationship as a result of the adoption (section 122 (b) of the Federal Court Act). The first two conditions in section 122 of the Federal Court Act are therefore satisfied.",
                "2.2. It remains to be ascertained whether a review of the Federal Court ’ s judgment is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation of Article 8 of the Convention (section 122(c) of the Federal Court Act). The mere fact that there has been a breach of the Convention does not mean that the decision referred to the European Court has to be reviewed. This follows from the very nature of the reopening procedure, which is an extraordinary remedy. Accordingly, if there is another ordinary remedy that could afford redress, that remedy should be used first. The answer to this question depends on the nature of the Convention violation that has been found. Where only material interests remain at stake, the proceedings cannot in principle be reopened. However, where the unlawful situation persists despite the European Court ’ s finding of a violation of the Convention, a review is possible. The proceedings are then reopened within the limits of the relevant ground ( see, with reference to the Federal Judicature Act, judgment 2A.232/2000 of 2 March 2001, point 2b/bb, published in: Pra 2001 no. 92, p. 538, and the judgments cited; and, with reference to the Federal Court Act, Elisabeth Escher, in Basler Kommentar BGG, Basle 2008, note 6 on section 122; judgment 1F_1/2007 of 30 July 2007, point 3.2).",
                "The European Court held on this point that the annulment of the adoption for lack of consent would not be able to remedy the effects of adoption at the origin of the dispute. An action to that end could not, according to the European Court ’ s case-law, be regarded as an effective remedy on the basis of which a plea of inadmissibility could be raised against the applicants for failure to exhaust domestic remedies. The European Court also held that the adopter and the adopted person ’ s mother could not be required to marry in order to restore the adopted person ’ s relationship with her mother. In the Court ’ s view, it is not for the national authorities to take the place of those concerned in reaching a decision as to the form of communal life they wish to adopt. The concept of family under Article 8 of the Convention is, moreover, not confined to marriage-based relationships. Accordingly, unless the mother-daughter relationship is restored and an amendment to that effect is made to the civil-status register, it must be acknowledged that the unlawful situation will persist.",
                "Accordingly, the application for review should be allowed and the judgment of 28 May 2003 should be set aside.",

In addition to this distinction in terms of substantive law there had been a distinction in terms of procedure at the material time: in the context of an administrative-law appeal – the only remedy used by the applicant association – the Federal Court had solely had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the refusal based on section 18(5) of the Radio and Television Act.

The refusal was therefore capable of constituting a fresh violation of Article 10 of the Convention, for the following reasons:",

In that respect it is comparable to the case of Hertel (dec.), cited above. It should be noted, however, that in the Hertel case the Federal Court granted the applicant ’ s application to reopen the proceedings, lifting to a significant extent the restrictions on his freedom of expression. The Committee of Ministers, moreover, concluded the procedure before it by means of a final resolution that took due account of the amendments to the Federal Court judgment held by the Court to have infringed Article 10.",
                "In view of these significant differences, the Court must consider whether its approach in the Hertel decision (cited above), which entailed examining whether the allegations of a fresh violation of Article 10 were well-founded rather than declaring them inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention or its Protocols, is also feasible in the present case.",
                "53. With regard to the measures taken by the Swiss Government in order to discharge their obligations under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention, it is not disputed that they paid the sums which the Court had awarded the applicant association for costs and expenses under Article 41 in its judgment. It is also clear from Resolution ResDH(2003)125 of 22 July 200 3 that the Court ’ s judgment was disseminated among the appropriate authorities and published in the journal Jurisprudence des autorités administratives de la Confédération and on the Internet (see paragraph 16 above).",

It should also be noted that the Committee of Ministers concluded its examination of application no. 24699/94 by noting the possibility of an application for review before the Federal Court, in other words without awaiting the outcome of that procedure, which was available under Swiss law (see the appendix to the resolution in paragraph 16 above).",
                "55. The Court further reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, mutatis mutandis, Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 16, § 33, and Bianchi v. Switzerland, no. 7548/04, § 84, 22 June 2006).",
                "It is true that the Convention does not require the States Parties to institute procedures for the fresh examination of a case following a finding of a violation by the Court (see Saïdi, cited above, p. 57, § 47, and Pelladoah, cited above, p. 36, § 44). The Court would nevertheless emphasise that the availability of such a procedure in Swiss law may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments and demonstrates a Contracting State ’ s commitment to the Convention and the case-law to which it has given rise (see, mutatis mutandis, Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain (Article 50), judgment of 13 June 1994, Series A no. 285 ‑ C, p. 56, § 15, and Lyons and Others, cited above).",
                "However, its availability in domestic law is not sufficient in itself. The domestic court concerned, namely the Federal Court, must in addition apply the Convention and the Court ’ s case-law directly (see also, mutatis mutandis, regarding the right of access to a court and the effectiveness required of an ordinary appeal or an appeal on points of law, Delcourt v. Belgium, judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, pp. 13-15, §§ 25 et seq.). This appears especially important in the present case since the Committee of Ministers closed the procedure for supervising execution of the Court ’ s judgment by simply referring to the availability of the remedy of an application for review, without awaiting its outcome. It is clear that a reference to a remedy which proves incapable of affording effective and practical redress where a Convention violation has been found will deprive applicants of their right to have the effects of the violation redressed as far as possible.",
                "56. Lastly, it follows from a grammatical interpretation of section 139 ( a ) of the former Federal Judicature Act (see ‘ Relevant domestic law and practice ’, paragraph 19 above) that an application to the Federal Court for reopening of the proceedings is a subsidiary means of redress, seeing that this provision states that such an application will be admissible where ‘ ... redress is possible only through such a review ’.",
                "It has to be noted in the present case that in its judgment of 28 June 2001 the Court did not make any award to the applicant association in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In the absence of any claim by the association under that head, it did not even express the opinion that the finding of a violation of Article 10 could be regarded as constituting adequate and sufficient redress for the non-pecuniary damage it had sustained. Accordingly, reopening of the proceedings before the Federal Court with a view to obtaining restitutio in integrum – the ideal form of reparation in international law – would have enabled the effects of the violation found by the Court to be redressed as far as possible (see, to similar effect, Pisano, cited above, § 43; Scozzari and Giunta, cited above, § 249; and Sejdovic, cited above, § 119; see also, for a practical example of the application of the relevant Swiss law, Hertel (dec.), cited above, in which the applicant had the general prohibition on disseminating his views lifted following his application to the Federal Court for a review (see ‘ Relevant domestic law and practice ’, paragraph 21 above).",
                "57. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the application to reopen the proceedings in the present case was worded in a very cursory fashion barely satisfying the requirements of section 140 (see ‘ Relevant domestic law and practice ’, paragraph 20 above). Nevertheless, the Federal Court ’ s findings as to the applicant association ’ s interest in broadcasting the commercial, while brief, were capable of giving rise to a fresh interference with the applicant association ’ s freedom of expression.",
                "58. The Court therefore considers that the complaint under Article 10 concerning the Federal Court ’ s refusal to review its judgment of 20 August 1997 must be regarded as raising a new issue that was not determined in the Court ’ s judgment of 28 June 2001, and is accordingly compatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. ...”"

They indicated the individual and general measures they had taken, which bore witness to the effort made at all levels – legislative, administrative and judicial – to comply with the Court ’ s judgment, for example: payment of the sum awarded to the applicant association by way of just satisfaction; the possibility of applying to the Federal Court to reopen the proceedings; the measures mentioned in the appendix to the Committee of Ministers ’ final resolution; the decision by the Director of the Federal Office of Communication to adopt a significantly narrower interpretation of the concept of “political advertising” in section 18(5) of the Federal Radio and Television Act, and the application of this new interpretation in many cases; and the entry into force of a fully revised version of the Federal Radio and Television Act of 24 March 2006, which incorporated the restrictive interpretation and provided for an appropriate, cost-free procedure for complaining, inter alia, that “a refusal to grant access to programme content was unlawful”."

With regard more specifically to the application to reopen the proceedings, it was clear from the actual wording of its resolution that the Committee of Ministers had not deemed it essential to ascertain the outcome of that application before adopting its final resolution. In the Government ’ s submission, it followed that the Committee of Ministers had considered, on the one hand, that the individual and general measures already adopted were sufficient in themselves to close the case irrespective of the outcome of the reopening procedure and, on the other, that such a procedure was indeed a possibility offered by domestic law, but not an obligation imposed by the Convention."

If Protocol No. 14 had already been in force, the Court would have been unable to assume jurisdiction in the instant case because Article 46 § 4 of the Convention, as amended by the Protocol, entitled the Committee of Ministers to institute infringement proceedings before the Court only in cases where a State persistently refused to abide by a final judgment, that is, before the final resolution of the Committee of Ministers had been adopted."

In the Government ’ s submission, the Chamber ’ s reasoning did not take account of the case-law to the effect that the Convention did not give the Court jurisdiction to direct a State to reopen proceedings. Reopening was not a requirement deriving from the Convention. In other words, if it was accepted that the Convention did not oblige States Parties to institute procedures for the fresh examination of a case, it should also be accepted that States that had opted for such procedures were free to determine the formal and substantive conditions governing them and, where they applied, to examine whether those conditions had been met. As with any interpretation of domestic law, the Court ’ s role was limited to ensuring that the examination by the national authorities and courts was not tainted by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness. The reasoning of the majority of the Chamber might give rise to unequal treatment between States whose domestic law provided for reopening procedures and those with no such procedures. The Government fully subscribed on that account to the dissenting opinion of the judges in the minority that “ [ a ] n unfavourable outcome for the applicant cannot be regarded as any less compatible with the Convention than the absence of such a procedure”. On that point, the Government emphasised that section 139 ( a ) of the former Federal Judicature Act had granted the applicant association the right to apply for review of a judgment but on no account the right to obtain such a review, let alone the outcome they desired."

A measure that had been impossible at the time of the initial judgment could not be possible in the proceedings aimed at securing a review of that judgment. In the Government ’ s submission, no such obligation could be inferred from the Convention either, as the two judges in the minority had also observed."

The Federal Court had been aware of this when considering the application to reopen the proceedings and had concluded, without any element of arbitrariness, that it was unlikely that the applicant association still had an interest in having the original version broadcast. This assessment was borne out by the fact that the applicant association had already lodged an appeal with the Federal Office of Communication against Publisuisse SA ’ s second refusal, a fact of which the Federal Court was likewise aware. The Government considered it self-evident, for the same reason, that the reopening procedure was not an appropriate context for determining whether or not this second refusal by Publisuisse SA was consistent with the applicant association ’ s freedom of expression."

Nevertheless, it did have the power to find against a respondent State where, after the domestic proceedings had been reopened, the national courts adopted an identical decision without any justification. What mattered in the Czech Government ’ s view was that, in general, a mere failure to remedy the original violation of the Convention as such could never constitute a fresh violation, the only exception being continuing violations, a category to which the instant case did not belong."

The Federal Court held, in particular, that the applicant association had not sufficiently shown that it still had an interest in broadcasting the original version of the commercial, which now appeared out of date almost eight years later. In the meantime, the applicant association had again applied to Publisuisse SA for permission to broadcast the commercial with the additional comment.

By comparison, one of the main arguments put forward by the domestic authorities in refusing permission to broadcast the commercial in the first set of proceedings brought by the applicant association related to the prohibition of political advertising. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Federal Court itself, the general context had evolved to such an extent that it was legitimate to wonder whether the applicant association still had an interest in broadcasting the commercial.

The State Party in question will be under an obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to take individual and/or, if appropriate, general measures in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress the effects, the aim being to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded (see, among many other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 198, ECHR 2004 ‑ II)."

These obligations reflect the principles of international law whereby a State responsible for a wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, consisting in restoring the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided that restitution is not “materially impossible” and “does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation” (Article 35 of the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – see paragraph 36 above). In other words, while restitution is the rule, there may be circumstances in which the State responsible is exempted – fully or in part – from this obligation, provided that it can show that such circumstances obtain."

In this connection, the Court emphasises the obligation on States to perform treaties in good faith, as noted, in particular, in the third paragraph of the Preamble to, and in Article 26 of, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (see paragraph 37 above)."

However, in certain special circumstances the Court has found it useful to indicate to a respondent State the type of measures that might be taken to put an end to the situation – often a systemic one – which has given rise to the finding of a violation (see, for example, Öcalan v. Turkey, no. 46221/99, § 210 in fine, ECHR 2005-IV, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 263, 13 July 2006).

France, 20 September 1993, § 47, Series A no. 261-C, and Pelladoah v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, § 44, Series A no. 297-B). However, where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court may indicate that a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation (see, among other authorities, Gençel v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, § 27, 23 October 2003; Öcalan, cited above, § 210; and Claes and Others v.

This is in keeping with the guidelines of the Committee of Ministers, which in Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 called on the States Parties to the Convention to introduce mechanisms for re-examining the case and reopening the proceedings at domestic level, finding that such measures represented “the most efficient, if not the only, means of achieving restitutio in integrum ” (see paragraph 33 above)."

The Grand Chamber shares that view. However, the reopening procedure must also afford the authorities of the respondent State the opportunity to abide by the conclusions and the spirit of the Court judgment being executed, while complying with the procedural safeguards in the Convention. This applies all the more where, as in the instant case, the Committee of Ministers merely notes the existence of a reopening procedure without awaiting its outcome. In other words, the reopening of proceedings that have infringed the Convention is not an end in itself; it is simply a means – albeit a key means – that may be used for a particular purpose, namely the full and proper execution of the Court ’ s judgments. Seeing that this is the sole criterion for assessing compliance with Article 46 § 1 and applies equally to all Contracting States, no discrimination can result between those which have introduced a reopening procedure in their legal system and others.",

In determining whether such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual."

Austria, 8 July 1986, § 42, Series A no. 103; Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 43, Series A no. 236; Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.

This applies all the more in the instant case, having regard to the Court ’ s judgment of 28 June 2001. Moreover, the television commercial concerned battery pig farming.

The Court further notes that the television commercial was never broadcast, even after the Court ’ s judgment had found that the refusal to broadcast it infringed freedom of expression. However, prior restraints on publication entail such dangers that they call for the most careful scrutiny (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 217, and Dammann v.

Furthermore, the Court has already found, in its judgment of 28 June 2001, that the interference in issue was not necessary in a democratic society, among other reasons because the authorities had not demonstrated in a relevant and sufficient manner why the grounds generally advanced in support of the prohibition of “political advertising ” could serve to justify the interference in the particular circumstances of the case (see VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no. 24699/94, § 75, ECHR 2001-VI ). The Federal Court subsequently dismissed the applicant association ’ s application to reopen the proceedings on the ground that the association had not provided a sufficient indication of its position as to the nature of “the amendment of the judgment and the redress being sought”, as it was formally required to do by section 140 of the former Federal Judicature Act (see paragraph 29 above). On this point, the Grand Chamber shares the view expressed in paragraph 62 of the Chamber judgment that this approach is overly formalistic in a context in which it is clear from the circumstances as a whole that the association ’ s application necessarily concerned the broadcasting of the commercial in question, which had been prohibited by the Federal Court itself on 20 August 1997."

            [
                "95. The Federal Court further held that the applicant association had not sufficiently shown that it still had an interest in broadcasting the commercial. As the Chamber observed in paragraph 62 of its judgment, the Federal Court thereby took the place of the applicant association, which alone was competent at that stage to judge whether there was still any purpose in broadcasting the commercial. The Grand Chamber shares that view. It further observes that the public interest in dissemination of a publication does not necessarily decrease with the passing of time (see, to similar effect, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV). Moreover, the Federal Court did not offer its own explanation of how the public debate on battery farming had changed or become less topical since 1994, when the commercial was initially meant to have been broadcast. Nor did it show that after the Court ’ s judgment of 28 June 2001 the circumstances had changed to such an extent as to cast doubt on the validity of the grounds on which the Court had found a violation of Article 10. Lastly, the Court must also reject the argument that the applicant association had alternative options for broadcasting the commercial in issue, for example via private and regional channels, since that would require third parties, or the association itself, to assume a responsibility that falls to the national authorities alone: that of taking appropriate action on a judgment of the Court."

                "96. Furthermore, the argument that the broadcasting of the commercial might be seen as unpleasant, in particular by consumers or meat traders and producers, cannot justify its continued prohibition. The Court reiterates in this connection that freedom of expression is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Lehideux and Isorni v. France, 23 September 1998, § 55, Reports 1998 ‑ VII; Murphy v. Ireland, no. 44179/98, § 72, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX; and Monnat, cited above, § 55)."

The defence lawyers then withdrew from the case and their clients stated that they did not want any other lawyer to be appointed. They conducted their own defence and denied committing the offence charged. In particular, the applicant said that his intention in the articles in issue had only been to condemn the oppression of the Muslim minority by the State and to draw attention to the problems which members of that minority encountered in their dealings with the administrative authorities. He pointed out that the term \"Turkish\" had been used for a long time not only in the press but also by the administrative and judicial authorities.

As candidates on an independent list in the general election of 5 November 1989 in Komotini, the accused wrote, between 10 and 20 October 1989, a pamphlet printed in Turkish which they distributed in the town of Komotini and other places in the department of Rodopi and in which the terms 'Turks', 'Turkish Muslims', 'Turkish Muslim minority of Western Thrace'and 'Turkish community' repeatedly appeared. In this manner the accused deliberately set out to describe as 'Turks\" the Greek citizens of Muslim faith, although they knew that under the Treaty of Lausanne only a Muslim minority, not a Turkish minority, has been recognised in the region of Western Thrace. Nevertheless, by the above-mentioned act, which was an appeal to the feelings, minds and will of the Greek citizens of the Muslim minority, the accused deliberately sought to instil and implant in their hearts the seeds of discord, hatred and hostility towards the Christian Greeks who lived in the same region. In this manner they succeeded in provoking and inciting the citizens to mutual discord, a further consequence of which was disturbance of the public peace. All the foregoing has been corroborated by the prosecution witnesses Athanasios Kamarakis, Stylianos Bletsas, Syrmatoula Lantzouraki and Konstantinos Tsetlakas, who, living in Komotini, had direct knowledge of these facts. They stated that, because of the distribution of the pamphlet in question, the public peace among the citizens of the town of Komotini was seriously disturbed, so that in a short space of time acts of violence were committed between Christians and Muslims. The accused's assertion that what they sought to achieve through the pamphlet in question was only to win the support of the electors of the Greek Muslim population is not convincing because, if that had been the case, they could have achieved their aim by any other suitable method without referring to Greek Muslims in the pamphlet in question as 'Turks', even though they knew that a Turkish minority is not recognised in Greek Thrace and that if they attempted to raise such an issue in such a sensitive region, the peace between Christian and Muslim Greeks would certainly be disturbed, which was indeed what actually happened. Consequently, the accused are declared guilty of the above-mentioned offence, as described analytically in the operative provisions of this judgment. Nevertheless, the Court will take into consideration the extenuating circumstance that before committing the offence the accused had always led blameless private, family, professional and social lives.\"",

The objective element of this offence - according to the Article mentioned - consists in provoking or inciting the citizens, publicly and in any manner whatsoever (whether orally or in writing), to commit acts of violence or to sow discord among themselves, or aversion and hate, thus disturbing the public peace, that is to say society's confidence in peaceful order.",

They had thus succeeded in provoking and sowing discord among the citizens, which disturbed the peace of the citizens of Komotini to such an extent that, in a short space of time, acts of violence were committed between Christians and Muslims in that town.

In its decision on the admissibility of the application the Commission dismissed the objection on the ground that the applicant had in substance raised before the Court of Cassation a complaint relating to a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). In addition, the Delegate of the Commission argued before the Court that it was sufficient, for the purposes of exhaustion, for the applicant to have challenged the State's actions in the domestic courts and thus afforded them the opportunity to put right the alleged violation. Referring to the case-law of the International Court of Justice and the generally recognised rules of international law (Article 26 of the Convention) (art. 26), he maintained that it was not necessary for the domestic remedy to be based on the same ground as the international remedy."

That principle is reflected in the rule set forth in Article 26 (art. 26), which \"dispenses States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system\" (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.

Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given. It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see the Cardot v.

The Constitutional Court was of the opinion that the courts of last instance, by ruling differently on the validity of claims based on identical facts and law, had placed appellants whose claims had been rejected in a materially different position from that of claimants whose claims had been allowed. There had accordingly been a violation of Article 36 § 1. However, the Constitutional Court considered that the allegations before it presented no constitutional basis upon which it could establish a violation of the appellants ’ right to a fair trial in so far as they complained about procedural fairness and the civil courts ’ allegedly inadequate characterisation of the legal nature of their claims. The appellants ’ additional complaint, raised under Article 21 of the Constitution, was also rejected. In particular, there was no evidence to corroborate the claim that the first - and second- instance court decisions in the appellants ’ civil case had been rendered on the basis of any “personal qualities”, this being a precondition for determining the existence of a violation of the principle of non-discrimination. The Constitutional Court took note of the Chamber ’ s finding of 28 August 2012 of a violation of the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 7 above; for additional constitutional case-law to this effect, see decision Už. 2886 ⁄ 10 of 4 October 2012, as well as decisions Už. 649 ⁄ 11 and Už. 2021 ⁄ 11, both of 12 December 2012, in their relevant parts), but for reasons that were different from those stated in this particular constitutional appeal.

In its reasoning, the Commissioner ’ s decision noted, inter alia, that the payments in question were per diems, notwithstanding that the Government had chosen to consider them as social benefits awarded to persons in need ( socijalna pomoć ), and that this was best exemplified by the fact that the reservists in question had had to renounce their legal claims concerning the per diems, as well as the fact that the individual reservists resident in the seven municipalities in issue were never under an obligation to prove their indigence ( imovinsko stanje i socijalnu ugroženost ). This being so, there was clearly no objective and reasonable justification for the differential treatment of reservists merely on the basis of their place of residence."

In other cases, however, where reservists had specifically raised the issue of discrimination stemming from the Agreement and relied on Article 21 of the Constitution in so doing, the Constitutional Court had done the opposite and felt no obligation to even consider it (see, for example, Už. 43 ∕ 11 described at paragraph 39 above). The reasoning in all decisions concerning cases like the applicants ’ had been practically identical and had consisted of ready-made formulas. In some cases though, the Constitutional Court had found that there had been differential treatment in breach of the Constitution based on the judicial inconsistency aspect of the case, but had merely ordered the publication of its decisions in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia as a form of compensation."

[GC], nos. 46113/99, 3843/02, 13751/02, 13466/03, 10200/04, 14163/04, 19993/04 and 21819/04, § 69, ECHR 2010, where the Court in addition quoted the comprehensive statement of principles set out in §§ 66 to 69 of the Akdivar and Others judgment, which in so far as relevant are reiterated here below)."

It is the Convention complaint which must have been aired at national level for there to have been exhaustion of “effective remedies”. It would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the Convention machinery if an applicant, ignoring a possible Convention argument, could rely on some other ground before the national authorities for challenging an impugned measure, but then lodge an application before the Court on the basis of the Convention argument (see Van Oosterwijck, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, pp. 16-17, §§ 33-34, and Azinas, cited above, § 38)."

It was also possible to challenge any discriminatory practices in respect of such payments as would run counter to the prohibition of discrimination under Article 21 of the Constitution (see paragraph 32 above). As from 7 April 2009 a victim of discrimination could in addition pray in aid section 43 of the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, which provided for various forms of injunctive and/or declaratory relief to victims of discrimination (see paragraph 40 above). The civil courts thus had full jurisdiction to examine claims such as those that were in issue in the present case. Indeed, in a number of comparable cases adjudicated between 2002 and early March 2009, where the claims in question had not been deemed time-barred, the first - instance and appellate courts across Serbia had upheld the reservists ’ claims (see paragraph 24 above). Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that at the material time an appeal to the civil courts constituted an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

By way of redress they sought the payment of specific sums on account of the allegedly unpaid per diems in issue and also certain other benefits. The applicants did not rely on the prohibition of discrimination in Article 21 of the Constitution, or on the non-discrimination clauses in Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12, although these were directly applicable according to Article 18 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 17, 19, 32, 40 and 41 above). Nor did they invoke the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, which entered into force with immediate effect on 7 April 2009, shortly after the above -mentioned civil claim had been filed.

The Appeals Court rejected their appeal on 16 November 2010 on similar grounds, namely that both the three-year and the five-year prescription periods provided for in section 376 §§ 1 and 2 (see paragraph 4 9 above) had expired. The Court would reiterate that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see Pérez de Rada Cavanilles v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII; Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; and Anđelković v.

These decisions may shed some light on the effectiveness of this remedy in such matters. In none of these cases did the Constitutional Court decline jurisdiction to examine the complaints made under Article 21 of the Constitution in relation to the allegedly discriminatory effects of the Agreement. In two of them it omitted to deal with the issue but upheld the constitutional appeals in question on other grounds (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). In the remaining ruling, pre-dating the case now under review, the Constitutional Court did not determine the complaint, referring to the “accessory character” of Article 21 and noting that the appellants had invoked no other constitutional provision to be applied in conjunction with that Article (see paragraph 37 above )."

In the Grand Chamber ’ s view, the above does not show that the constitutional remedy would have offered no reasonable prospect of success in respect of the applicants ’ discrimination complaint had they sought to properly raise it before the Constitutional Court. On a number of previous occasions when examining applications lodged against the same respondent State, the Court has held that “a constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered as an effective domestic remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of all applications introduced [against Serbia ] as of 7 August 2008” (see Vinčić, cited above, § 51; see also Rakić and Others v.

The Grand Chamber sees no reason for holding otherwise in the present instance. Indeed, where legal systems provide constitutional protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms, it is in principle incumbent on the aggrieved individual to test the extent of that protection and allow the domestic courts to develop those rights by way of interpretation (see Vinčić, cited above, § 51; see also, mutatis mutandis and in the common law context, D v. Ireland (dec.), no. 26499/02, § 85, 28 June 2006, and A, B and C v. Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, § 142, ECHR 2010).

In the Court ’ s understanding this finding indicated that, whilst the interpretation of the statutory limitation rules in the instant case had been deemed “acceptable” when considered in isolation, what was incompatible with the constitutional right in question was the national civil courts ’ differing practices in this area.

However, for a court to agree to re-examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a 'fugitive'.

The irregularity could concern, in particular, a breach of the rules on service of process and, more specifically, failure to observe the safeguards afforded to defendants deemed to be untraceable. If the objection was declared admissible, the court had to suspend the enforcement of the sentence. If it was allowed, the statutory period for appealing against the judgment was reopened. The applicant could have availed himself of this remedy if he had shown that the police had been negligent in their searches or that the safeguards for defendants deemed to be untraceable had not been observed."

If such an application was granted, the time allowed for appealing was reopened and the defendant had the opportunity to submit any arguments in support of his or her case – in person or through counsel – before a court with jurisdiction to deal with all matters of fact and law.

However, such a period, which had not been peculiar to Italian law, had been sufficient to allow persons on trial to exercise their right to defend themselves, as its starting-point had been fixed as the moment at which they had had “effective knowledge of the decision” (as the Court of Cassation had held on 3 July 1990 in Rizzo ).

Evidence of this had been very easy to provide since in most cases it resulted from the actual manner in which the conviction had been served. It had been sufficient for applicants to state – without having to supply proof – the reasons why they had not been informed of the judgment in time to lodge an appeal. The fact that they might have been aware of other procedural steps, or that the reasons they gave might have resulted from their own lack of diligence, had not meant that the application should be refused.

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Akdivar and Others v.

In particular, the only remedies which the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are at the same time available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Dalia v.

Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports 1996-VI).

The new procedural rules introduced subsequently and the special circumstances of Mr Sejdovic's case, they argued, set it apart from those cases, in which there had been cause to doubt that the applicants had deliberately sought to evade justice, or that they had had the opportunity of taking part in the trial, or grounds to believe that the authorities had been negligent in ascertaining the accused's whereabouts."

Switzerland (no. 20491/92, ECHR 2001-VI) that the intention to escape trial extinguished the right of a person convicted in absentia to a new trial under the Convention. In that connection, the Government pointed out that the Court had endorsed the view of the Swiss authorities that Mr Medenica's trial in absentia had been lawful and that it had not been necessary to reopen the proceedings because his inability to appear had been his own fault and he had not provided any valid excuse for his absence. Furthermore, the presumption that a defendant had sought to evade justice was not irrebuttable. Convicted persons could always provide explanations by arguing that they had never been aware of the proceedings and consequently had not intended to abscond, or by citing a legitimate impediment. In such cases it was for the prosecution to seek to prove the contrary where appropriate, and for the judicial authorities to assess the relevance of the convicted person's explanations."

Italy (cited above), in which the Court had refused to attach any importance to the indirect knowledge which the applicants had had or might have had of the proceedings against them and of the date of their trial. Although the Court's excessive formalism and severity in the above two cases were understandable in the light of the legislation in force in Italy at the material time, they were not acceptable today."

Admittedly, a purely formal notification (as in the present case, where the relevant documents had been served on the officially appointed lawyer) could not give rise to an irrebuttable statutory presumption that the accused had been aware of the proceedings. However, a presumption to the contrary was equally unjustified. That would amount to denying that the accused might be aware of the proceedings where there was evidence that they were guilty and had absconded (for example, where criminals escaped from police officers pursuing them immediately after the offence, or where defendants produced a written statement declaring their guilt, their contempt towards the victims and their intention to remain untraceable). In the Government's submission, the mere fact that an applicant had not been notified of the conviction did not in itself constitute sufficient proof that he or she had acted in good faith; further evidence of negligence on the part of the authorities was required."

It would therefore be advisable, they argued, to take a more balanced, common sense approach consisting in assuming – at least provisionally – that the accused had absconded if such an inference was justified by the particular circumstances of the case, regard being had to logic and to ordinary experience, and seeking to substantiate this through concrete evidence. In particular, it was not contrary to the presumption of innocence to assume that persons accused of an offence had absconded where it proved impossible to ascertain their whereabouts immediately after the offence had been committed. Such an assumption was reinforced if they were subsequently found guilty on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial and did not provide any relevant explanation as to what had caused them to leave their home address. That was precisely what had happened in the applicant's case, in which the Rome Assize Court had carefully established the facts, basing its findings on statements by several eyewitnesses."

That would, however, be contrary to the purpose of all judicial proceedings – namely establishing the truth – and would mean that justice was denied or the victims were caused additional anguish. There would also be paradoxical consequences: defendants who were quicker and more skilful at escaping would be at an advantage in relation to those who were caught unawares by an initial summons. If that were so, only the accused would have the power to review the validity of their own trial, and the guilty would be in a more favourable position than the innocent. Furthermore, people who had consciously sought to evade trial could claim a right “which logic and any sense of justice suggest[ed] should not be theirs”: the right to clutter the courts' lists of cases and to inconvenience victims and witnesses at a later stage."

It had accordingly accepted that unjustified absences could be discouraged and that States were entitled to impose on defendants the burden of justifying their absence and, subsequently, to assess the validity of such explanations. It was true that in the above cases the Court had held that the sanctions imposed on the defendants (the impossibility of being represented by counsel) had been disproportionate; however, it had implicitly accepted that Article 6 would not have been infringed if the restrictions on the absent defendants' rights had struck a fair balance."

In the latter case they would be precluded from assessing, on the facts, the reasons why the defendant could not be traced.

The Court observes at the outset that the instant case differs from Medenica (cited above, § 59), in which the applicant had been informed in good time of the proceedings against him and of the date of his trial. He also had the assistance of and was in contact with a lawyer of his own choosing. Lastly, the Court found that Mr Medenica's absence had been due to his own culpable conduct and agreed with the Swiss Federal Court that he had misled the American court by making equivocal and even knowingly inaccurate statements with the aim of securing a decision that would make it impossible for him to attend his trial (ibid., § 58). His position was therefore very different from that of the applicant in the instant case. In the particular circumstances of the present case the question arises whether, if official notice was not served on him, Mr Sejdovic may be regarded as having been sufficiently aware of his prosecution and the trial to be able to decide to waive his right to appear in court, or to evade justice."

In previous cases concerning convictions in absentia, the Court has held that to inform someone of a prosecution brought against him is a legal act of such importance that it must be carried out in accordance with procedural and substantive requirements capable of guaranteeing the effective exercise of the accused's rights; vague and informal knowledge cannot suffice (see T. v. Italy, cited above, § 28, and Somogyi, cited above, § 75). The Court cannot, however, rule out the possibility that certain established facts might provide an unequivocal indication that the accused is aware of the existence of the criminal proceedings against him and of the nature and the cause of the accusation and does not intend to take part in the trial or wishes to escape prosecution. This may be the case, for example, where the accused states publicly or in writing that he does not intend to respond to summonses of which he has become aware through sources other than the authorities, or succeeds in evading an attempted arrest (see, among other authorities, Iavarazzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 50489/99, 4 December 2001), or when materials are brought to the attention of the authorities which unequivocally show that he is aware of the proceedings pending against him and of the charges he faces."

The Government's argument is not based on any objective factors other than the applicant's absence from his usual place of residence, viewed in the light of the evidence against him; it assumes that the applicant was involved in, or indeed responsible for, the killing of Mr S. The Court is therefore unable to accept this argument, which also runs counter to the presumption of innocence. The establishment of the applicant's guilt according to law was the purpose of criminal proceedings which, at the time when the applicant was deemed to be a fugitive, were at the preliminary investigation stage."

The Court observes at the outset that it has found that the Government are estopped from raising a preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies on the basis of this provision (see paragraph 42 above). However, such a finding does not preclude the Court from taking the remedy referred to by the Government into consideration in its examination of the merits of the complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, N.C. v. Italy, cited above, §§ 42-47 and 53-58). It notes that in Italian law an objection to execution is admissible only where it is established that there has been an irregularity in the proceedings capable of rendering the judgment void, particularly with regard to the service of process on defendants who cannot be traced (see paragraphs 31 and 71 above). However, the Government themselves admitted that in the present case the summons had been served in accordance with domestic law (see paragraph 72 above). Use by the applicant of the remedy in Article 670 of the CCP would therefore have had no prospect of success."

In so far as the Government referred to the possibility for the applicant to apply for leave to appeal out of time, the Court would simply reiterate the observations it set out in connection with the preliminary objection (see paragraphs 47-56 above). It notes again that the remedy provided for in Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP, as in force at the time of the applicant's arrest and detention pending extradition, was bound to fail and there were objective obstacles to his using it. In particular, the applicant would have encountered serious difficulties in satisfying one of the legal preconditions for the grant of leave to appeal, namely in proving that he had not deliberately refused to take cognisance of the procedural steps or sought to escape trial. The Court has also found that there might have been uncertainty as to the distribution of the burden of proof in respect of that precondition (see paragraphs 49-51 above). Doubts therefore arise as to whether the applicant's right not to have to prove that he had no intention of evading trial was respected. The applicant might have been unable to provide convincing explanations, when requested to do so by the court or challenged by the prosecution, as to why, shortly after the killing of Mr S., he had left his home without leaving a contact address and travelled to Germany. Moreover, the applicant, who could have been deemed to have had “effective knowledge of the judgment” shortly after being arrested in Germany, had only ten days to apply for leave to appeal out of time. There is no evidence to suggest that he had been informed of the possibility of reopening the time allowed for appealing against his conviction and of the short time available for attempting such a remedy. These circumstances, taken together with the difficulties that a person detained in a foreign country would have encountered in rapidly contacting a lawyer familiar with Italian law and in giving him a precise account of the facts and detailed instructions, created objective obstacles to the use by the applicant of the remedy provided for in Article 175 § 2 of the CCP (see paragraphs 53-55 above)."

They could either make use of evidence and statements obtained during the original trial (although this could entail an infringement of the accused's right not to be convicted on the basis of statements by persons whom he or she had never had the opportunity to examine), or acquit the accused in spite of the existence of sufficient evidence to satisfy the court beyond reasonable doubt of his or her guilt (which would amount to a potential breach of the positive obligation to protect other rights guaranteed by the Convention)."

This kind of adjudicative approach by the Court to systemic or structural problems in the national legal order has been described as a “pilot-judgment procedure”. The procedure is primarily designed to assist the Contracting States in fulfilling their role in the Convention system by resolving such problems at national level, thereby securing to the persons concerned the Convention rights and freedoms as required by Article 1 of the Convention, offering them more rapid redress and, at the same time, easing the burden on the Court, which would otherwise have to take to judgment large numbers of applications similar in substance (see Broniowski v.

An individual constitutional complaint can be lodged against a legal provision only when an individual considers that the provision in question infringes his or her fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution. The procedure of an individual constitutional complaint cannot therefore serve as an effective remedy if the alleged violation resulted only from an erroneous application or interpretation of a legal provision which, in its content, is not unconstitutional (see Latvijas jauno zemnieku apvienība, cited above, §§ 44- 4 5 )."

In the present case, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaint concerning the organ removal does not relate to the compatibility of one legal provision with another legal provision having superior force. The Government argued that the organ removal had taken place in accordance with the procedure laid down in law. The applicant, for her part, did not contest the constitutionality of this procedure. Instead, she argued that her wishes as the closest relative had not been taken into account. The Court finds that the applicant ’ s complaint relates to the application and interpretation of domestic law, in the light particularly of the absence of relevant administrative regulation; it cannot be said that any issues of compatibility arise. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicant need not have exhausted the proposed remedy."

The prosecutor relied on Article 17 of the Additional Protocol and indicated that at the relevant time (May 2002) in Latvia these issues were regulated in sections 4 and 11 of the Law. These provisions did not require consent from close relatives unless the removal was from the body of a dead child. The rules relating to transplantation coordinators obliged them to obtain relatives ’ consent only in cases prescribed by law. The prosecutor concluded that there were no grounds to consider that the medical practitioners, in taking the decision to remove organs and in carrying out the removal of those organs, had infringed legal provisions. Therefore, there were no grounds to charge them with a crime under section 139 of the Criminal Law; at that time no other person had been charged with the crime.

These provisions, as in force in May 2002, therefore did not oblige medical practitioners to actively search for and inform the closest relatives of a deceased person about the possible removal for transplantation purposes of his or her body tissue and organs unless that person was a child.

The Court considers, however, that there is no need to examine the issue of transferability of rights in more detail in the present case since the applicant complains of a violation of her own rights in connection with the removal of her son ’ s organs after his death.

Latvia ( (dec.), no. 36117/02, ECHR-2003 II (extracts)). They considered that the applicant should have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court since the removal of her son ’ s organs had been carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in sections 4 and 11 of the Law.

The Government emphasised that at the material time the MADEKKI had been the competent body to examine the applicant ’ s complaints. Moreover, the applicant had not appealed against the MADEKKI ’ s report, which it had submitted to the Security Police and to the prosecutor ’ s office. It was the Government ’ s submission that the MADEKKI ’ s examination of the compliance of the organ removal procedure with domestic law was a necessary precondition for instituting any civil or criminal proceedings against those responsible. They did not provide any further information in this regard."

Thirdly, the Government submitted that the applicant could rely on section 1635 of the Civil Law ( as effective from 1 March 2006) and claim compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss in the civil courts. The possibility of using this remedy was still open to the applicant. Citing the Court ’ s decision in Andrasik and Others v. Slovakia (no. 57984/00, 22 October 2002), the Government argued that the proposed remedy had become available shortly after the applicant had submitted her application to the Court on 18 January 2005. The Government provided some examples of domestic case-law pertaining to the application of section 1635 in practice. They referred to the proceedings in case PAC-714 (instituted on 7 February 2005), where a claimant had sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage from a hospital where she had given birth and where tubal ligation ( surgical contraception ) had been performed without her consent (see L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 8, 29 April 2014 ( not yet final )). On 1 December 2006 that claim had been upheld and the claimant had been awarded compensation for physical injury and moral suffering in the amount of 10,000 Latvian lati (LVL) in respect of the unlawful sterilisation on the basis of section 2349 of the Civil Law. This judgment had taken effect on 10 February 2007. The Government also referred to one of the “Talsi tragedy” cases (instituted on 15 September 2006), where on 16 March 2010 the appellate court had awarded compensation payable by the State in the amount of LVL 20,000 in connection with the incident of 28 June 1997 in Talsi where, among other children, the claimant ’ s daughter had died.

Lastly, proceeding on the assumption that the alleged violation stemmed from the actual wording of the relevant provisions of the domestic law, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to comply with the six-month time-limit since, in their view, complaints to the Security Police or the prosecutor ’ s office were not effective remedies. Even if they had been, the outcome of proceedings before these institutions would have been largely dependent on the examination carried out by the MADEKKI, the report of which institution the applicant had not contested. The Government insisted that the applicant had found out about the organ removal on 11 February 2003 and that the MADEKKI report had been adopted on 7 May 2003. They concluded that the applicant had failed to lodge an application with the Court within six months from either of these dates."

In response to the first remedy invoked by the Government – recourse to the Constitutional Court – the applicant pointed out that the Constitutional Court ’ s competence did not include examining whether a specific legal provision had been correctly interpreted. The case of Grišankovs and Grišankova concerned a legal provision which the applicants in that case considered to be contrary to the Convention. The applicant in the present case referred to section 11 and pointed out that the system of “presumed consent” in Latvia had been limited by the wishes expressed by the relatives. She considered that the issue in the present case was not a legal provision itself but rather the fact that persons responsible for the removal of the organs had carried out the procedure without trying to establish the wishes of the closest relatives. Therefore, Grišankovs and Grišankova did not apply."

In response to the second remedy invoked by the Government, namely a complaint to the MADEKKI, the applicant agreed that she had not personally submitted a complaint to that authority. However, in response to her complaint to the Security Police and the prosecutor ’ s office, both had requested the report. Even if the applicant had personally submitted such a complaint, the result would have been the same. According to the applicant, she could not have appealed against the MADEKKI report since it was not an administrative act but rather an expert report drawn up in the course of criminal proceedings, against which no appeal lay. In any event, the MADEKKI report in itself had been neither sufficient to provide redress for the applicant nor legally binding. The applicant referred to the case of Manoussakis and Others v. Greece ( 26 September 1996, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV ) in support."

In response to the third remedy invoked by the Government, the applicant pointed out that section 139 of the Criminal Law provided for criminal responsibility expressis verbis for the unlawful removal of organs or body tissue. She pointed out that, making use of her right to choose the remedy, she had sought to find out who was responsible and bore criminal responsibility for the removal. The applicant had done everything that could have been expected of her within the criminal proceedings; she could not have been required to start civil proceedings on the same matter. She relied on the cases of Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria ( 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII ) and Fredriksen and Others v.

The MADEKKI report had merely contained an expert ’ s opinion obtained in the course of criminal proceedings on some of the many questions arising in those proceedings; it had not been a final decision."

The Court has noted that the Constitutional Court examined, inter alia, individual complaints challenging the constitutionality of a legal provision or its compliance with a provision having superior legal force. An individual constitutional complaint can be lodged against a legal provision only when an individual considers that the provision in question infringes his or her fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution. The procedure of an individual constitutional complaint cannot therefore serve as an effective remedy if the alleged violation resulted only from an erroneous application or interpretation of a legal provision which, in its content, is not unconstitutional (see Latvijas jauno zemnieku apvienība, cited above, §§ 44- 4 5 )."

The Government argued that the organ removal had taken place in accordance with the procedure laid down in law. The applicant, for her part, did not contest the constitutionality of this procedure. Instead, she argued that her wishes as the closest relative had not been taken into account. The Court finds that the applicant ’ s complaint relates to the application and interpretation of domestic law, in the light particularly of the absence of relevant administrative regulation; it cannot be said that any issues of compatibility arise. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicant need not have exhausted the proposed remedy."

The fact that the applicant herself had not complained to the MADEKKI is not relevant in the circumstances of the present case, in relation to which that institution had prepared a report for the purposes of criminal proceedings. The Court does not see how the applicant could have contested the MADEKKI ’ s findings in this context, given that they merely relayed the experts ’ opinion as to whether or not the medical practitioners had complied with the law in carrying out the removal of organs. In any event, the Court notes that it is normally the task of the investigating and prosecuting authorities to establish whether any crime has been committed and that, in doing so, these authorities would take into account all evidence, including any specialists ’ reports. Since the applicant had complained about all the decisions adopted by the investigating and prosecuting authorities, the Court cannot hold it against her that she did not lodge a separate complaint with the MADEKKI."

The Court observes that the applicant in the present case availed herself of the criminal avenue of redress in accordance with the applicable provisions of domestic law. The remedy pursued by her could have given rise to a finding that the removal of her son ’ s organs had been carried out contrary to the domestic procedure and that her rights as the closest relative had been breached. It could eventually have led to an award of compensation, given that the Latvian legal system recognises victims ’ rights to lodge civil claims in criminal proceedings and to request compensation for damage suffered as a result of a crime (see paragraph 45 above).

Taking the foregoing into account, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or for non-compliance with the six-month time-limit. Accordingly, the Government ’ s objections in this regard must be dismissed. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the concepts of private and family life are broad terms not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see Hadri-Vionnet v. Switzerland, no. 55525/00, § 51, 14 February 2008). In the case of Pannullo and Forte v. France (no. 37794/97, § 36, ECHR 2001 - X), the Court considered the excessive delay by the French authorities in returning the body of their child following an autopsy to be interference with the private and family life of the applicants. It has also considered that the refusal of the investigative authorities to return the bodies of deceased persons to their relatives constituted an interference with the applicants ’ private and family life (see Sabanchiyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 38450/05, § 123, ECHR 2013 (extracts) and Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, § 212, 6 June 2013). The Court notes that there is no dispute between the parties that the applicant ’ s right – established under domestic law – to express consent or refusal in relation to the removal of her son ’ s organs (see paragraph 87 below) comes within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. The Government did not contest this. The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise and thus considers that this Article is applicable in the circumstances of the case. The Court notes that this complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible."

The applicant emphasised that she had been deprived of her rights, granted by domestic law, to object to her son ’ s organ removal.

Relying on X and Y v. the Netherlands, she argued that although the object of Article 8 was essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it did not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there were positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life; these obligations involved the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private or family life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). She further referred to the case of Ciubotaru v. Moldova, confirming that the positive obligations included certain positive procedural safeguards, for example, an effective procedural framework whereby applicants could assert their rights under Article 8 under conditions of fairness, not least in relation to questions of proof and evidence (see Ciubotaru v. Moldova, no. 27138/04, § 51, 27 April 2010)."

                "80. The applicant further reasoned that the interference with her rights had been neither in accordance with law nor necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. As concerns the first of these considerations, the applicant ’ s view was that by granting the closest relatives the right to express binding wishes in relation to organ removal, the domestic law had struck the right balance between private and family life and the rights of others. In the applicant ’ s case, the domestic authorities had not fulfilled their duty to provide conditions for these wishes to be expressed. For the interference to be in “accordance with the law”, the law had to be clear and had to provide the possibility of exercising the protected rights. As regards the second consideration, the applicant argued that the interference had not been proportionate. There had to be some mechanism to establish the wishes of a dying person through his or her closest relatives if that person had not made such wishes known during his or her lifetime. The existence of such a mechanism would be proportionate, imposing less of a limit on the right to private and family life and not hindering society ’ s legitimate interests, since the circle of close relatives who could object to organ removal would remain very limited. In such cases, the lack of an answer from the relatives – after a specified period and after contacting them and requesting them to express their wishes – could be presumed to constitute consent. The applicant concluded that there had been no pressing social need which could have exempted the authorities from their duty of seeking to establish the wishes of the closest relatives concerning organ removal."

They argued that the organ removal had been carried out in accordance with domestic law. The Law had implied the “presumed consent system” that had served the aim of protecting the heath and the rights of others. The Government pointed out that that the “presumed consent system” was not innovative and that Latvia was not even the only country employing this system; it was also instituted in eleven other States."

At the same time, the Government acknowledged that the issue of whether or not presumed consent was sufficient or explicit consent was required for organ removal for transplantation purposes had been neither resolved nor unanimously applied among the Contracting States themselves. They contended that the subject of debate was rooted in national legal traditions and there was no European consensus on the rigid application of either system. The Government argued that the legislator ’ s action in establishing a “presumed consent system” fully complied with the generally accepted rule that the removal of organs from a deceased person could not take place against the expressed or presumed wishes of the person concerned. They submitted that the Member States could decide if and under what conditions – for example vis à vis the wishes of the deceased ’ s next-of-kin – the removal could be carried out in the absence of the expressed wishes of the deceased. In this regard, the Government referred to Article 10 § 1 of Resolution (78) 29 (see paragraph 27 above). The Government reiterated that domestic law at the material time provided for the possibility to register a person ’ s wishes in relation to the removal of his or her organs."

Given the wide margin of appreciation in this area, the Government emphasised that the “presumed consent” laid down in domestic law was a process which required a person or his or her closest relative to actively express their objection to certain procedures on that person ’ s body. The Government argued that the relevant domestic law provision set out the procedure in accordance with which a person who objected to the removal of his or her organs or another person ’ s organs (the applicant ’ s son ’ s organs in the present case) was to take positive steps to intervene, thereby effectively vetoing such removal."

The Government disagreed with the applicant, arguing that under the “presumed consent system” the applicant had not in any way been deprived of her right to object to the removal of her son ’ s organs. The Government ’ s submission was that the applicant herself had failed to take any steps to establish her son ’ s whereabouts, obtain information about his medical condition, or make known in good time any wishes in relation to possible organ removal. They pointed out that when a deceased person ’ s closest relatives were not present at the hospital, national laws did not impose any obligation on a doctor or on the medical institution itself to make specific inquires in order to ascertain if there was any objection from those persons as regards possible organ removal. In this connection they referred to a domestic decision (in case no. 1840000303) where a city court had confirmed that section 4 of the Law provided for the right of the closest relatives to object to removal of the deceased person ’ s organs, but did not impose any obligation on the medical expert to explain these rights to the relatives. In addition, they pointed to the opinions of legal and medical scholars who considered that complicated ethical issues arose due to the inevitable conflict between the devastating emotional impact of the death on the family and the speed with which a decision on organ transplantation had to be made."

Any interference under the first paragraph of Article 8 must be justified in terms of the second paragraph, namely as being “in accordance with the law” and “necessary in a democratic society” for one or more of the legitimate aims listed therein. The notion of necessity implies that the interference correlates with a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to one of the legitimate aims pursued by the authorities (see A, B and C v.

The parties did not contest this. However, their views differed in so far as the exercise of this right was concerned. The applicant ’ s view was that the domestic authorities had not fulfilled their duty to provide conditions whereby her wishes in relation to the removal of the applicant ’ s son ’ s organs for transplantation purposes could be expressed. According to the Government, the “presumed consent system ” in Latvia was an active process and the persons involved were expected to take positive steps if they wished to veto any organ removal. It is the Court ’ s view that these issues appertain to the quality of domestic law, in particular, whether the domestic legislation was formulated with sufficient precision or afforded adequate legal protection against arbitrariness in the absence of the relevant administrative regulation."

Against this background, while clearly there was a medical emergency given his critical condition, it cannot be said that it had been practically impossible to contact his closest relatives or at least to make an attempt to contact them, informing them of his condition and making enquiries about the possible organ transplantation. Indeed, the applicant submits that she was in contact with the doctors at the Hospital; the Government deny this for the simple reason that no contact details were recorded on her son ’ s medical card. Be that as it may, the starting point of the Court ’ s analysis is that, as established by the domestic authorities, the applicant was not informed about the possible removal of her son ’ s organs for transplantation purposes (see paragraphs 15, 18, 20 and 22 above)."

As to whether the domestic law was formulated with sufficient precision, the Court notes that the domestic authorities, most notably the Security Police and the prosecutor ’ s office, considered that the failure to inform the applicant about the possible removal of her son ’ s organs did not contravene domestic law (see paragraphs 16, 20, 24 -26 above). However, the Minister for Health was of the opinion that the applicant should have been informed; it has been mentioned that as a result of a proposal by a working group established in the Ministry, certain amendments to the Law had been proposed to improve clarity (see paragraph 23 above). These amendments were later adopted by Parliament with effect from 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 41 above). Such disagreement and the subsequent changes in the legislation indicate a lack of reasonable clarity as to the nature of the discretion conferred on the public authorities under domestic law at the time. While Latvian law set out the legal framework allowing the closest relatives to express their wishes in relation to organ removal for transplantation purposes, it did not define with sufficient clarity the scope of the corresponding obligation or the discretion conferred on medical practitioners or other authorities in this respect."

At the time when the applicant ’ s son was still alive, between 26 and 29 May 2002, no procedure was laid down in law for State institutions to follow in order to establish that person ’ s own views on organ transplantation (see paragraph 35 above). Following the death of the applicant ’ s son, as explained by the prosecution, only sections 4 and 11 of the Law were applicable (see paragraphs 25 -26 above). The Government referred to domestic case-law, confirming that there was no legal duty to inform the closest relatives about imminent organ removal, and argued that the Law implied that action was needed to be taken by the relatives. The Court reiterates that the principle of legality requires States not only to respect and apply, in a foreseeable and consistent manner, the laws they have enacted, but also, as a necessary part, to ensure the legal and practical conditions for their implementation (see mutatis mutandis Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, §§ 147 and 184, ECHR 2004 V). In the present case, it remains unclear how the “presumed consent system”, as established under the Latvian law, operates in practice in the circumstances in which the applicant found herself, whereby she had certain rights as the closest relative but was not informed – let alone provided with any explanation – as to how and when these rights might have to be exercised."

As to whether the domestic law afforded adequate legal protection against arbitrariness, the Court observes that the Security Police admitted that the co-ordinator of the transplantation centre had been responsible for informing relatives of issues pertaining to organ transplantation (see paragraph 20 above), but according to the prosecution there was no obligation laid down in law to obtain their consent (see paragraph 25 above). The prosecution also explained that the relevant provisions prohibited organ removal in cases where a refusal or an objection had been received but not in cases where the wishes of the closest relative had not been established (see paragraph 26 above ). The Government, while arguing that the removal of organs from the deceased person could not take place against the expressed or presumed wishes of the person concerned, nevertheless admitted that it was not necessary for the medical expert to explain the rights of the closest relatives or to make any inquires as to their wishes. The Court notes a considerable uncertainty as to the applicable law in these various positions. As noted by the applicant and uncontested by the Government, several medical examinations were carried out prior to the actual organ transplantation to establish whether the applicant ’ s son ’ s organs were in fact compatible with the potential recipient ’ s body. The amount of time required to carry out such examinations, short as it might have been, could have been sufficient to provide a real opportunity for the applicant to express her wishes in the absence of those of her son.

Furthermore, while the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private life.

However, the applicant had only challenged the 2016 article in proceedings under sections 6 and 8a of the Media Act. As judgments adopted under the Media Act did not have binding effect on subsequent civil proceedings under Article 1330 of the Civil Code, the applicant could also have brought an action under Article 1330 of the Civil Code in respect of the 2016 article."

By the time the second article forming the subject matter of the instant application had been published in February 2016, any claims under the Media Act in relation to the 2015 article had already become time-barred (on account of the time-limit of six months pursuant to section 8a (2) of the Media Act; see paragraph 39 above). The applicant contended that the fact that no legal action had been taken in relation to previously published content which had breached the law did not prompt the conclusion that legal action in relation to different published content was not justified."

The applicant submitted that the institution of counterstatement proceedings (see paragraph 41 above) under sections 12 et seq. of the Media Act did not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 of the Convention either. Proceedings of that kind were aimed at securing an entirely different form of legal protection. By means of his application under sections 6 and 8a of the Media Act, the applicant had sought compensation for the non-pecuniary damage resulting from the humiliation he had suffered. By contrast, counterstatement proceedings had the purpose of rectifying false media coverage and offered no possibility of enforcing compensation payments. Such proceedings would therefore also have been unsuitable for setting aside judgments that dismissed claims and thus for redressing the violation of the Convention in his case."

Even though cease-and-desist claims and claims in respect of pecuniary damage could be brought under Article 1330 of the Civil Code, the Supreme Court ’ s case-law suggested that there was no right to compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage. Moreover, a civil action could not bring about the setting aside of judgments by which claims under the Media Act were dismissed."

Lastly, the applicant found that the Government ’ s suggested remedies of requesting a criminal investigation with respect to the impugned statements under Articles 111 and/or 115 of the Criminal Code or reporting them to the authorities under Article 297 of the Criminal Code would not have been effective either. Fulfilling the elements of the offence defined in section 6 of the Media Act merely required the presence of the actus reus as defined in the above Articles of the Criminal Code. In addition, Articles 111 and 115 governed offences subject to private prosecution, which could only be prosecuted by the injured party, and not by the public prosecutor ’ s office of its own motion. Thus, a prosecution would in addition have required proof of fault and would therefore have been less likely to be successful than the claims for damages which the applicant himself had brought. A prosecution pursuant to Article 297 of the Criminal Code would also have been unlikely to be successful, as it required the victim to have been exposed to prosecution himself, which had not been the case with the applicant."

Article 35 § 1 requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law, and further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV). The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged violation. The rule is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection (see Vučković and Others v.

Switzerland [GC], no 10593/08, § 128, ECHR 2012).

The Contracting States may regulate questions of compensation for non-pecuniary damage differently, and the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State ’ s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (see Mertinas and Mertinienė, cited above, § 51). However, such limits must not be such as to deprive the individual of his or her privacy and thereby empty the right of its effective content (see Biriuk v.

However, in a case where the Supreme Court of Cyprus denied applicants equitable relief in respect of damage caused by an unlawful administrative act without sufficiently explaining its reasoning, the Court has found a violation of Article 8 (see Taliadorou and Stylianou v. Cyprus, nos. 39627/05 and 39631/05, § 58, 16 October 2008).

The Polish Government submitted that in cases where there were indications that statements concerning the past which were inconsistent with historical facts could actually lead to incitement of racial hatred and discrimination against ethnic, religious and social groups, it might be justified or even necessary to limit the freedom of expression as regards the publication of such statements. When balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life, the Convention States were entitled to treat cases regarding the denial of the Holocaust and other statements relating to Nazi crimes as a separate category, and to adopt a policy that such statements demonstrating disdain towards the victims of the Holocaust did not deserve State protection under the head of freedom of speech (with reference to Witzsch v.

In the instant case, however, the domestic courts never reached the stage of conducting a balancing exercise between the competing Convention rights, as they essentially considered that the applicant could not possibly be personally affected by a publication which reiterated the course of criminal proceedings, or by statements repeated therein which did not have a separate meaning from their first publication in 2015."

It based its interpretation of the domestic law relating to the legal standing of a group on previous domestic case-law (see paragraph 21 above). The very particular question of whether members of a group can be personally affected by a statement which concerns a historical event involving a group that was large at the time but has since been reduced to a rather small number of individuals, as in the instant case, appears not to have yet been dealt with by the domestic courts (see paragraph 35 above). The Court of Appeal, as the second- and last-instance court in the proceedings, did not mention the question of legal standing at all, notwithstanding this apparent lack of established case-law, the extensive arguments raised by the applicant in his initial claim and in his appeal (see paragraphs 18-20 and 23 above), and the fact that the determination of this preliminary question was essential for the examination of the merits of the claim. Since no finding was made on this issue, the core of the applicant ’ s claim – namely that in his view, he had indeed been personally affected by the defamatory nature of the statements, because the group had meanwhile been reduced to a very small number of members – was consequently never examined by the domestic courts.

In any event, it is obvious that the person concerned would not be able to lodge a timely appeal in a situation where the latter became aware of the warrant and the secret surveillance conducted on its basis after that period. Relying on the decision of the Court of Cassation of 28 March 2014 (see paragraph 34 above), the Government submitted that the applicant could have lodged an appeal against the warrant of 3 February 2010 within fifteen days from the moment when she became acquainted with it, that is 12 May 2010, which she failed to do. It should be noted, however, that the relevant decision of the Court of Cassation concerned a specific situation where a person had attempted to appeal against a judicial warrant authorising an operative and intelligence measure in a case where the prosecution had not pursued the charges against him in court. Therefore the given example of domestic case ‑ law cannot be regarded as supporting the Government ’ s claim that the applicant had an effective possibility of lodging an appeal against the warrant, having found out about it at the end of the investigation in the circumstances where the criminal case against her was about to be sent to the trial court for examination on the merits. The Government has not submitted any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal accepted for examination an appeal against a procedural decision concerning a piece of evidence forming part of an indictment in a case which had been transmitted or was about to be transmitted to the trial court determining the criminal charge against a person.

However, the Court of Cassation was not called to examine the powers and competence of the Court of Appeal when examining appeals against procedural decisions rendered in the course of criminal proceedings where an indictment had been finalised, with the result that the case file had been transmitted to the trial court whereas the Government, as noted above, has not produced any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal agreed to adjudicate an appeal against a judicial warrant relating to evidence forming part of the body of incriminating evidence submitted to a court determining a criminal charge."

Notably, in its decision of 28 March 2014 the Court of Cassation also acknowledged the need to adopt a different approach, in so far as the procedure for lodging appeals against procedural decisions was concerned, depending on the type of the operative and intelligence measure.

In those circumstances, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Kennedy, cited above, § 119; and Goranova ‑ Karaeneva, cited above, § 48)."

The Government did not engage with this submission. In particular, the operative part of the warrant did not state the applicant ’ s name as the person in whose respect audio and video recording was permitted to be carried out by the police (see paragraph 9 above). The Government submitted that it was clear from the reasoning of the warrant that the secret surveillance was authorised in respect of the applicant. The Court observes, however, that the reasoning part of the court warrant of 3 February 2010 is a literal reproduction of the relevant application lodged by the Head of the Department Against Organised Crime where the latter had stated that A.S. ’ s actions had contained the elements of a crime prescribed by Article 311, that is of bribe-taking (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). To follow the Government ’ s approach would entail speculation as to whether the relevant application and the court warrant issued on its basis mistakenly stated A.S. ’ s name instead of that of the applicant and that the secret surveillance measures had eventually been authorised in respect of the applicant and not any other person. In any event, the Court is of the opinion that secret surveillance being a serious interference with a person ’ s right to respect for private life, a judicial authorisation serving as its basis cannot be drafted in such vague terms as to leave room for speculation and assumptions with regard to its content and, most importantly, to the person in whose respect the given measure is being applied."

The Court observes that Section 14 (1) of the Operative and Intelligence Measures Act contains an exhaustive list of types of operative and intelligence measures and that list does not contain a measure called “audio and video recordings” (see paragraph 31 above) referred to in the court warrant of 3 February 2010. In the present case the police recorded the applicant ’ s conversations with A.S. during their meetings of 3 and 4 February as well as their telephone conversation on the former date (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). It appears therefore that the police carried out two distinct types of operative and intelligence measures, that is external surveillance and interception of telephone communications (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above), whereas the court warrant of 3 February 2010 did not specify those measures.",

Data on children with disabilities were drawn largely from administrative sources rather than being derived from a thorough assessment of the actual characteristics of the child.

These indicators were now associated with the Global Alliance for the Education of Young Children, which included member organisations in Europe and, more particularly, the Czech Republic. Relevant indicators included : ethical principles to guide assessment practices; the use of assessment instruments for their intended purposes and in such a way as to meet professional quality criteria; assessments appropriate to the ages and other characteristics of the children being assessed; recognition of the developmental and educational significance of the subject matter of the assessment; the use of assessment evidence to understand and improve learning; the gathering of assessment evidence from realistic settings and in situations that reflected children ’ s actual performance; the use of multiple sources of evidence gathered over time for assessments; the existence of a link between screening and follow- up; limitations on the use of individually administered, norm-referenced tests; and adequate information for staff and families involved in the assessment process.",

Evidence was not obtained in realistic or authentic settings where children could demonstrate their skills.

It is in that context that Roma children undergo tests designed to ascertain their capacity to follow the ordinary curriculum, following which parents of Roma children are encouraged to place their children in special schools. The parents ’ choice to place their children in special schools, where that is what they choose to do, is consistent with the school authorities ’ desire not to admit so many Roma children that their arrival might induce the parents of non-Roma children to remove their own children from the school."

The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs is likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denies both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens.

Such practices increased educational inequity as they had especially negative effects on the achievement levels of disadvantaged children (see, inter alia, the Communication from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council and to the European Parliament on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems (COM/2006/0481, 8 September 2006) ).

In this respect, it might be envisaged having recourse to distance education, based on new communication technologies.",

Particular attention should also be paid to the need to ensure better communication with parents, where necessary using mediators from the Roma/Gypsy community which could then lead to specific career possibilities. Special information and advice should be given to parents about the necessity of education and about the support mechanisms that municipalities can offer families. There has to be mutual understanding between parents and schools. The parents ’ exclusion and lack of knowledge and education (even illiteracy) also prevent children from benefiting from the education system.",

Roma/Gypsy parents often favoured this solution, partly to avoid abuse from non-Roma/Gypsy children in ordinary schools and isolation of the child from other neighbourhood Roma/Gypsy children, and partly owing to a relatively low level of interest in education. Most Roma/Gypsy children were consequently relegated to educational facilities designed for other purposes, offering little opportunity for skills training or educational preparation and therefore very limited opportunity for further study or employment.

The standardised test developed by the Czech Ministry of Education for assessing a child ’ s mental level was not mandatory and was only one of a battery of tools and methods recommended to the psychological counselling centres. As to the other element required in order to send a child to a special school – the consent of the child ’ s legal guardian – ECRI observed that parents making such decisions continued to lack information concerning the long-term negative consequences of sending their children to such schools, which were often presented to parents as an opportunity for their children to receive specialised help and be with other Roma children. ECRI also said that it had received reports of Roma parents being turned away from ordinary schools.",

The government regarded the practice of referring large numbers of Roma children to special schools as untenable. The need for affirmative action was due not only to the socio-cultural handicap of Roma children, but also to the nature of the whole education system and its inability to sufficiently reflect cultural differences. The proposed new Schools Act would bring changes to the special- education system by transforming “special schools” into “special primary schools”, thus providing the children targeted assistance in overcoming their socio-cultural handicap. These included preparatory classes, individual study programmes for children in special schools, measures concerning pre-school education, an expanded role for assistants from the Roma community and specialised teacher-training programmes. As one of the main problems encountered by Roma pupils was their poor command of the Czech language, the Ministry of Education considered that the best solution (and the only realistic one) would be to provide preparatory classes at the pre-school stage for children from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds.",

According to unofficial estimates, Roma accounted for up to 70% of pupils in these schools, and this – having regard to the percentage of Roma in the population – raised doubts concerning the tests ’ validity and the methodology followed. This situation was made all the more disturbing by the fact that it also made it more difficult for Roma children to gain access to other levels of education, thus reducing their chances of integrating in society. Although legislation no longer prevented children from advancing from special to ordinary secondary schools, the level of education offered by special schools generally did not make it possible to cope with the requirements of secondary schools, with the result that most dropped out of the system. Although estimates of the number of Roma children who remained outside the school system varied, those who did attend school rarely advanced beyond primary school."

In addition, the Advisory Committee noted that, in spite of the awareness-raising initiatives taken by the Ministry of Education, many of the Roma children who attended ordinary schools were isolated by other children and by teaching staff, or even placed in separate classes. At the same time, it was recognised that in some schools Roma children were the largest pupil group simply because the schools concerned were located near the places where Roma resided compactly. According to other sources, material conditions in some of the schools they attended were precarious and the teaching they received was still, in most cases, insufficiently adapted to their situation. It was important to ensure that these schools, too, provided quality education."

According to the Advisory Committee priority had to go to placing Roma children in ordinary schools, supporting and promoting preparatory classes and also to educational assistants. Recruiting Roma teaching staff and making all education staff aware of the specific situation of Roma children also needed to receive increased attention. An active involvement on the part of the parents, in particular with regard to the implementation of the new Schools Act, also needed to be promoted as a condition sine qua non for the overall improvement of the educational situation of the Roma. Lastly, more determined action was needed to combat isolation of Roma children in both ordinary and special schools. A clearer approach, coupled with instructions and immediate action on all levels, was needed to put an end to unjustified placement of these children in special schools designed for children with mental disabilities. Effective monitoring measures, particularly designed to eliminate undue placement of children in such schools, had to be one of the authorities ’ constant priorities.",

                "77. In the third section of the report, which concerns discrimination in education, the Commissioner for Human Rights noted that the fact that a significant number of Roma children did not have access to education of a similar standard enjoyed by other children was in part a result of discriminatory practices and prejudices. In that connection, he noted that segregation in education was a common feature in many Council of Europe member States. In some countries there were segregated schools in segregated settlements, in others special classes for Roma children in ordinary schools or a clear over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with special needs. Roma children were frequently placed in classes for children with special needs without an adequate psychological or pedagogical assessment, the real criteria clearly being their ethnic origin. Being subjected to special schools or classes often meant that these children followed a curriculum inferior to those of mainstream classes, which diminished their opportunities for further education and for finding employment in the future. The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs was likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denied both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens. It excluded Roma children from mainstream society at the very beginning of their lives, increasing the risk of their being caught in the vicious circle of marginalisation."

                "78. The Commissioner was told that in the Czech Republic the young members of the Roma/Gypsy community were drastically over-represented in “special” schools and classes for children with a slight mental disability. At the same time he noted that the authorities had introduced Roma assistant teachers in ordinary classes and set up preliminary classes and that these initiatives had had promising results, though only on a small scale due to the lack of adequate resources. In particular, preparatory classes for socially disadvantaged children had been central in efforts to overcome excessive attendance of Roma children in special schools. The Czech authorities deemed that preparatory schools attached to nursery schools had been particularly successful in easing the integration of Roma children in ordinary schools. In 2004 the Czech Republic also had 332 teaching assistants who attended to the special needs of Roma pupils."

                "79. It was also noted that special classes or special curricula for the Roma had been introduced with good intentions, for the purposes of overcoming language barriers or remedying the lack of pre-school attendance of Roma children. Evidently, it was necessary to respond to such challenges, but segregation or systematic placement of Roma children in classes which followed a simplified or a special Romany -language curriculum while isolating them from other pupils was clearly a distorted response. Instead of segregation, significant emphasis had to be placed on measures such as pre-school and in-school educational and linguistic support as well as the provision of school assistants to work alongside teachers. In certain communities, it was crucial to raise the awareness of Roma parents, who themselves might not have had the possibility to attend school, of the necessity and benefits of adequate education for their children."

            [
                "80. In conclusion, the Commissioner made a number of recommendations related to education. Where segregated education still existed in one form or another, it had to be replaced by ordinary integrated education and, where appropriate, banned through legislation. Adequate resources had to be made available for the provision of pre-school education, language training and school- assistant training in order to ensure the success of desegregation efforts. Adequate assessment had to be made before children were placed in special classes, in order to ensure that the sole criterion in the placement was the objective needs of the child, not his or her ethnicity.",

Article 4 § 1, which concerns the burden of proof, reads: “Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment. ”"

Schools and educational authorities may, for example, segregate pupils on the basis of a perception of “their different needs” and/or as a response to behavioural issues and learning difficulties. The latter could also lead to the frequent placement of Roma pupils in special schools for mentally handicapped children, which was still a worrying phenomenon in member States of the European Union like Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Thus it is just as discriminatory to treat men less favourably than women as it is to treat women less favourably than men; and it is just as discriminatory to treat whites less favourably than blacks as it is to treat blacks less favourably than whites. The ingredients of unlawful discrimination are (i) a difference in treatment between one person and another person (real or hypothetical) from a different sex or racial group; (ii) that the treatment is less favourable to one; (iii) that their relevant circumstances are the same or not materially different; and (iv) that the difference in treatment is on sex or racial grounds. However, because people rarely advertise their prejudices and may not even be aware of them, discrimination has normally to be proved by inference rather than direct evidence. Once treatment less favourable than that of a comparable person (ingredients (i), (ii) and (iii)) is shown, the court will look to the alleged discriminator for an explanation. The explanation must, of course, be unrelated to the race or sex of the complainant. If there is no, or no satisfactory explanation, it is legitimate to infer that the less favourable treatment was on racial grounds ...",
                "74. If direct discrimination of this sort is shown, that is that. Save for some very limited exceptions, there is no defence of objective justification. The whole point of the law is to require suppliers to treat each person as an individual, not as a member of a group. The individual should not be assumed to hold the characteristics which the supplier associates with the group, whether or not most members of the group do indeed have such characteristics, a process sometimes referred to as stereotyping. ...",
                "75. The complaint in this case is of direct discrimination against the Roma. Indirect discrimination arises where an employer or supplier treats everyone in the same way, but he applies to them all a requirement or condition which members of one sex or racial group are much less likely to be able to meet than members of another: for example, a test of heavy lifting which men would be much more likely to pass than women. This is only unlawful if the requirement is one which cannot be justified independently of the sex or race of those involved ... But it is the requirement or condition that may be justified, not the discrimination. This sort of justification should not be confused with the possibility that there may be an objective justification for discriminatory treatment which would otherwise fall foul of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",

But that is what is required by a law which tries to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the general characteristics of the group to which they belong. In 2001, when the operation with which we are concerned began, the race relations legislation had only just been extended to cover the activities of the immigration service.

The officers did not make any record of the ethnic origin of the people they interviewed. The respondents cannot therefore provide us with figures of how many from each group were interviewed, for how long, and with what result. This, they suggest, makes it clear that the officers were not relying on the Authorisation: if they had been, they would only have had to record their view of the passenger ’ s ethnicity. If correct, that would have been enough to justify refusal of leave. But what it also shows is that no formal steps were being taken to gather the information which might have helped ensure that this high-risk operation was not being conducted in a discriminatory manner. It also means that the only information available is that supplied by the claimants, and in particular the ERRC which was attempting to monitor the operation.

As, in the instant case, the applicants considered that they had indisputably succeeded in establishing the existence of a disproportionate impact, the burden of proof had to shift to the Government to prove that the applicants ’ ethnic origin had had no bearing on the impugned decisions and that sufficient safeguards against discrimination were in place."

In that connection, the applicants noted that in its General Policy Recommendation No. 7, ECRI had invited the States to prohibit both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination, with neither concept requiring proof of discriminatory intent. A clear majority of the member States of the Council of Europe had already expressly prohibited discrimination in sections of their national legislation without requiring proof of such intent and this was reflected in the judicial practice of those States. The applicants referred in this context to, inter alia, the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Regina v. Immigration Officer at Prague Airport and another ex parte European Roma Rights Centre and others (see paragraph 105 above) and to the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Lastly, they noted that indirect discrimination was also prohibited under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination."

For this reason, the applicants asked the Grand Chamber to give a clear ruling that intent was not necessary to prove discrimination under Article 14, except in cases – such as of racially motivated violence – where it was already an element of the underlying offence."

In the instant case, the applicants did not claim that the competent authorities had at the relevant time harboured invidiously racist attitudes towards Roma, or that they had intended to discriminate against Roma, or even that they had failed to take positive measures. All the applicants needed to prove – and, in their submission, had proved – was that the authorities had subjected the applicants to differential adverse treatment in comparison with similarly situated non-Roma, without objective and reasonable justification. The question of a common European standard that had been raised by the Government was, in the applicants ’ view, more of a political issue and the existence or otherwise of such a standard was of no relevance as the principle of equality of treatment was a binding rule of international law."

Similarly, the applicants asked the Grand Chamber to provide guidance concerning the kinds of proof, including but not limited to statistical evidence, which might be relevant to a claim of a violation of Article 14. They noted that the Chamber had discounted the overwhelming statistical evidence they had adduced, without checking whether or not it was accurate, despite the fact that it had been corroborated by independent specialised intergovernmental bodies (ECRI, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities ) and by the government ’ s own admission (see paragraphs 41 and 66 above). According to this data, although Roma represented only 5% of all primary- school pupils at the time the application was lodged, they made up more than 50% of the population of special schools. Whereas fewer than 2% of non-Roma pupils in Ostrava were assigned to special schools, over 50% of Roma children were sent to such schools. Overall, a Roma child was more than twenty-seven times more likely than a similarly situated non-Roma child to be assigned to a special school."

In the applicants ’ view, these figures strongly suggested that, whether through conscious design or reprehensible neglect, race or ethnicity had infected the process of school assignment to a substantial – perhaps determining – extent. The presumption that they, like other Roma children in the city of Ostrava, had been the victims of discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin had never been rebutted. It was undisputed that as a result of their assignment to special schools the applicants had received a substantially inferior education as compared with non-Roma children and that this had effectively deprived them of the opportunity to pursue a secondary education other than in a vocational training centre."

In this context, they argued that both in Europe and beyond statistical data was often used in cases which, as here, concerned discriminatory effect, as sometimes it was the only means of proving indirect discrimination. Statistical data was accepted as a means of proof of discrimination by the bodies responsible for supervising the United Nations treaties and by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Council Directive 2000/43/EC expressly provided that indirect discrimination could be established by any means “including on the basis of statistical evidence”."

Recently, the Court had indicated in its decision in Hoogendijk (cited above) that, while statistics alone were not sufficient to prove discrimination, they could – particularly where they were undisputed – amount to prima facie evidence requiring the Government to provide an objective explanation of the differential treatment.

The applicants added that it would be helpful for the Grand Chamber to clarify the Court ’ s case-law by determining whether there was an objective and reasonable justification for the purposes of Article 14 for the difference in treatment in the present case and specifying the conclusions that should be drawn in the absence of a satisfactory explanation. Referring to, inter alia, the judgments in Timishev v. Russia (nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII ) and Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no. 2) (nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, § 140, 12 July 2005 ), they stated that where an applicant had established a difference in treatment the onus was on the respondent State to prove that it was justified. In the absence of a racially neutral explanation, it was legitimate to conclude that the difference in treatment was based on racial grounds. In the applicants ’ submission, neither an inadequate command of the Czech language, nor poverty nor a different socio-economic status could constitute an objective and reasonable justification in their case. They denied that the disproportionately large number of Roma children in special schools could be explained by the results of intellectual capacity tests or justified by parental consent (see also paragraphs 1 41 - 42 below)."

In view of the importance of the fight against racial and ethnic discrimination that had constantly been reaffirmed by the Strasbourg institutions, the applicants considered that the Grand Chamber should state in clear terms that the States ’ “margin of appreciation” could not serve to justify segregation in education. The approach adopted by the Chamber, which left an unlimited margin of appreciation to the Czech State, was unjustified in view of the serious allegations of racial and ethnic discrimination in the instant case and was inconsistent with the Court ’ s case-law. The present case warranted all the more the Court ’ s attention in that it concerned one of the most important substantive rights, namely the right to education."

There were no uniform rules at the material time governing the manner in which the tests used by the educational psychology centres were administered and the results interpreted, so that much had been left to the discretion of the psychologists and there had been considerable scope for racial prejudice and cultural insensitivity. Further, the tests which they and other Roma children had been forced to sit were scientifically flawed and educationally unsound. The documentary evidence showed that a number of the applicants had been placed in special schools for reasons other than intellectual deficiencies (such as absenteeism, bad behaviour, and even misconduct on the part of the parents). The Czech Government had themselves acknowledged the discriminatory effect of the tests (see paragraph 6 6 above). They had also admitted in their observations on the present case that one of the applicants had been placed in a special school despite possessing good verbal communication skills."

Nor, in the applicants ’ submission, could the discriminatory treatment to which they had been subjected be justified by their parents ’ consent to their placement in the special schools.

Neither parental conduct nor parental choice could deprive them of that right.",

In any event, even supposing that consent had been given by all the parents, it had no legal value as the parents concerned had never been properly informed of their right to withhold their consent, of alternatives to placement in a special school or of the risks and consequences of such a placement. The procedure was largely formal: the parents were given a pre-completed form and the results of the psychological tests, results they believed they had no right to contest. As to the alleged right subsequently to request a transfer to an ordinary school, the applicants pointed out that from their very first year at school they had received a substantially inferior education that made it impossible for them subsequently to meet the requirements of the ordinary schools.",
                "Moreover, it was unrealistic to consider the issue of consent without taking into account the history of Roma segregation in education and the absence of adequate information on the choices available to Roma parents.

Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 66, Series A no. 171-A) that a waiver may be lawful for certain rights but not for others and that it must not run counter to any important public interest, the applicants submitted that there could be no waiver of the child ’ s right not to be racially discriminated against in education."

Thus, in May 2006 eight of the applicants were continuing their education in a special school while a further six who had completed special school found themselves unemployed. Of the four applicants who had been allowed to attend ordinary primary school after passing the aptitude tests, two were still at school, one was unemployed and the fourth was enrolled in a vocational secondary school.

The new legislation thus acknowledged that the very existence of schools deemed “special” imposed a badge of inferiority on those placed there. In reality, however, the new law had not brought about changes in practice as it had merely altered the criteria on which educational programmes were based. Extensive research carried out by the European Roma Rights Centre in 2005 and 2006 showed that in many cases special schools had simply been renamed “remedial schools” or “practical schools” without any substantial change in the composition of their teaching staff or the content of their curriculum."

Although the Roma ostensibly enjoyed the same rights as other citizens, in reality their prospects were limited by both objective and subjective factors. There could be no improvement in their situation without the involvement and commitment of all members of the Roma community. When they attempted to eliminate these inequalities, member States were confronted with numerous political, social, economic and technical problems which could not be confined to the question of respect for fundamental rights. It was for this reason that the courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, had to exercise a degree of restraint when examining measures adopted in this field and confine themselves to deciding whether or not the competent authorities had overstepped their margin of appreciation."

Referring to their previous written and oral observations, the Government reiterated that race, colour or association with a national minority had not played a determining role in the applicants ’ education. There was no specific evidence of any difference in treatment of the applicants on the basis of those grounds. The applicants ’ school files showed beyond doubt that their placement in special schools was not based on their ethnic origin, but on the results of psychological tests carried out at the educational psychology centres. Since the applicants had been placed in special schools on account of their specific educational needs resulting essentially from their intellectual capacity and since the criteria, the process by which the criteria were applied and the system of special schools were all racially neutral, as the Chamber had confirmed in its judgment, it was not possible to speak of overt or direct discrimination in the instant case."

They contended that the case of Zarb Adami (cited above), in which the Court had relied extensively on statistical evidence submitted by the parties, was not comparable to the instant case. Firstly, Zarb Adami was far less complex. Secondly, the statistical disparities found in that case between the number of men and women called to perform jury service were the result of a decision by the State, whereas the statistics relied on by the applicants in the instant case reflected first and foremost the parents ’ wishes for their children to attend special school, not any act or omission on the part of the State. Had the parents not expressed such a wish ( by giving their consent) the children would not have been placed in a special school.",

There was no official information on the ethnic origin of the pupils. The Government further considered that the statistics had no informative value without an evaluation of the socio-cultural background of the Roma, their family situation and their attitude towards education. They pointed out in that connection that the Ostrava region had one of the largest Roma populations in the Czech Republic.",

On this latter point, the Government contested the applicants ’ claim that they had not submitted any satisfactory explanation regarding the large number of Roma in special schools. While admitting that the situation of the Roma with regard to education was not ideal, the Government considered that they had demonstrated that the special schools had not been established for the Roma community and that ethnic origin had not been a criterion for deciding on placements in special schools. They reiterated that special-school placements were only possible after prior individualised pedagogical and psychological testing. The testing process was a technical tool that was the subject of continuing scientific research and for that reason could only be carried out by qualified personnel. The courts did not possess the necessary qualifications and therefore had to exercise a degree of restraint in this field. As regards the professional standards referred to in the observations of the International Step by Step Association and others, the Government emphasised that these were not legal norms possessing force of law but, at most, non-binding recommendations or indications by specialists and that the failure to apply them could not, by definition, entail international legal responsibility."

In the instant case, the parents had been informed that their children ’ s placement in a special school depended on their consent and the consequences of such a decision had been explained to them. If the effect of their consent was not entirely clear, they could have appealed against the decision regarding placement and could at any time have required their child ’ s transfer to a different type of school. If, as they now alleged, their consent was not informed, they should have sought information from the competent authorities. The Government noted in this respect that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 emphasised the primary role and responsibility of parents in the education of their children. The State could not intervene if there was nothing in the parents ’ conduct to indicate that they were unable or unwilling to decide on the most appropriate form of education for their children. Interference of that sort would contravene the principle that the State had to respect parents ’ wishes regarding education and teaching.",

However, none of the applicants had established that they had attempted to do so (albeit unsuccessfully) or that their (alleged) difficulties were due to a more limited education as a result of their earlier placement in a special school. On the contrary, several of the applicants had decided not to pursue their studies or had abandoned them. The Government were firmly convinced that the applicants had deprived themselves of the possibility of continuing their studies through a lack of interest.

The Government noted in this connection that when determining the State ’ s positive obligations the Court sometimes referred to developments in the legislation of the Contracting Parties.

Pupils with disabilities were individually integrated, wherever possible and desirable, into conventional schools. However, schools were authorised to set up separate classes with educational techniques and methods adjusted to their needs. The former “special schools” could continue to function as separate institutions, but were now “primary schools” providing education under a modified educational programme for primary education. Schools at which socially disadvantaged pupils were educated often made use of their right to establish assistant teacher ’ s posts and preparatory classes designed to improve the children ’ s communication skills and command of the Czech language. Teaching assistants from the Roma community often served as a link between the school, family, and, in some instances, other experts and helped to integrate pupils into the education system.

All these bodies had found that no objective and reasonable justification could legitimise the disadvantage faced by Roma children in the field of education. The degree of consistency among the institutions and quasi-judicial bodies was persuasive in confirming the existence of widespread discrimination against Roma children."

The FIDH considered that the Chamber had unjustifiably placed significant weight in its judgment on the consent the applicants ’ parents had allegedly given to the situation forming the subject of their complaint to the Court. It noted that under the Court ’ s case-law there were situations in which the waiver of a right was not considered capable of exempting the State from its obligation to guarantee to every person within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms laid down in the Convention. That applied, in particular, where the waiver conflicted with an important public interest, or was not explicit or unequivocal. Furthermore, in order to be capable of justifying a restriction of the right or freedom of the individual, the waiver of that guarantee by the person concerned had to take place in circumstances from which it could be concluded that he was fully aware of the consequences, in particular the legal consequences, of his choice. In the case of R. v. Borden ([1994] 3 RCS 145, p. 162), the Supreme Court of Canada had developed the following principle on that precise point: “[i]n order for a waiver of the right ... to be effective, the person purporting to consent must be possessed of the requisite informational foundation for a true relinquishment of the right. A right to choose requires not only the volition to prefer one option over another, but also sufficient available information to make the preference meaningful. ”"

The question therefore arose as to whether, in the light of the nature of the principle of equality of treatment, and of the link between the prohibition of racial discrimination and the wider concept of human dignity, waiver of the right to protection against discrimination ought not to be precluded altogether. In the instant case, the consent obtained from the applicants ’ parents was binding not solely on the applicants but on all the children of the Roma community. It was perfectly possible – indeed, in the FIDH ’ s submission, probable – that all parents of Roma children would prefer an integrated education for their children, but that, being uncertain as regards the choice that would be made by other parents in that situation, they preferred the “security” offered by special education, which was followed by the vast majority of Roma children. In a context characterised by a history of discrimination against the Roma, the choice available to the parents of Roma children was between (a) placing their children in schools where the authorities were reluctant to admit them and where they feared being the subject of various forms of harassment and of manifestations of hostility on the part of their fellow pupils and of teachers, or (b) placing them in special schools where Roma children were in a large majority and where, consequently, they would not have to fear the manifestation of such prejudices. In reality, the applicants ’ parents had chosen what they saw as being the lesser of two evils, in the absence of any real possibility of receiving an integrated education which would unreservedly welcome Roma. The disproportion between the two alternatives was such that the applicants ’ parents had been obliged to make the choice for which the Government now sought to hold them responsible."

Germany, no. 59140/00, § 33, 25 October 2005 ). However, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article ( see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v. Belgium ( merits), 23 July 1968, p. 34, § 10, Series A no. 6; Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000-IV; and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 5 1, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI ). The Court has also accepted that a general policy or measure that has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group may be considered discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed at that group ( see Hugh Jordan, cited above, and Hoogendijk, cited above ), and that discrimination potentially contrary to the Convention may result from a de facto situation ( see Zarb Adami, cited above )."

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy ’ s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova, cited above, and Timishev, cited above ). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person ’ s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures ( see Timishev, cited above, § 58)."

The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake."

In certain circumstances, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see Salman v.

In Nachova and Others ( cited above, § 157), the Court did not rule out requiring a respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination in certain cases, even though it considered that it would be difficult to do so in that particular case in which the allegation was that an act of violence had been motivated by racial prejudice.

In view of the fact that a difference in treatment has been established in the instant case, it follows that any such consent would signify an acceptance of the difference in treatment, even if discriminatory, in other words a waiver of the right not to be discriminated against. However, under the Court ’ s case-law, the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention – in so far as such a waiver is permissible – must be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent ( see Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, 25 February 1992, §§ 37-38, Series A no. 227) and without constraint ( see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 51, Series A no. 35)."

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court is not satisfied that the parents of the Roma children, who were members of a disadvantaged community and often poorly educated, were capable of weighing up all the aspects of the situation and the consequences of giving their consent. The Government themselves admitted that consent in this instance had been given by means of a signature on a pre-completed form that contained no information on the available alternatives or the differences between the special-school curriculum and the curriculum followed in other schools. Nor do the domestic authorities appear to have taken any additional measures to ensure that the Roma parents received all the information they needed to make an informed decision or were aware of the consequences that giving their consent would have for their children ’ s futures. It also appears indisputable that the Roma parents were faced with a dilemma: a choice between ordinary schools that were ill-equipped to cater for their children ’ s social and cultural differences and in which their children risked isolation and ostracism, and special schools where the majority of the pupils were Roma."

The Court is gratified to note that, unlike some countries, the Czech Republic has sought to tackle the problem and acknowledges that, in its attempts to achieve the social and educational integration of the disadvantaged group which the Roma form, it has had to contend with numerous difficulties as a result of, inter alia, the cultural specificities of that minority and a degree of hostility on the part of the parents of non-Roma children. As the Chamber noted in its admissibility decision in the instant case, the choice between a single school for everyone, highly specialised structures and unified structures with specialised sections is not an easy one. It entails a difficult balancing exercise between the competing interests. As to the setting and planning of the curriculum, this mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule ( see Valsamis v.

Furthermore, as a result of the arrangements the applicants were placed in schools for children with mental disabilities where a more basic curriculum was followed than in ordinary schools and where they were isolated from pupils from the wider population. As a result, they received an education which compounded their difficulties and compromised their subsequent personal development instead of tackling their real problems or helping them to integrate into the ordinary schools and develop the skills that would facilitate life among the majority population.

In so far as the Government suggested that the applicant could have pursued an ordinary civil remedy, the Court observes that the Government have not shown, by means of examples or effective and substantiated argumentation, that such a remedy could have examined the applicant ’ s challenges to the exequatur decision in a timely procedure, or that it could have, if necessary, annulled the said order or its consequences in respect of the applicant. Similarly, while the Convention is incorporated in San Marino law and is directly applicable in San Marino, the Government have not furnished any example of a litigant having successfully relied on the Convention to apply to a domestic authority in order to obtain redress in similar circumstances. Moreover, it is unclear – and the Government have not explained – what procedure would have been followed and what would have been the legal effect of such a complaint (see also, Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, § 64, 23 September 2004 ). The Court considers that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of a remedy with examples of domestic case-law, but it is ready to accept that this may be more difficult in smaller jurisdictions, such as in the present case, where the number of cases of a specific kind may be fewer than in the larger jurisdictions (see Aden Ahmed v.

In any event, the Court has already held that a claim for damages against the State in an action before the ordinary courts is clearly distinct from – and should not be confused with – an application for judicial review. Accordingly, it would not have been a remedy capable of achieving the aim sought by the applicant of having the impugned search and seizure, or its consequences, annulled and could therefore not be regarded as an “effective review” for the purposes of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, Xavier Da Silveira, cited above, § 48; and Pruteanu v.

They further challenged the appeal decisions in so far as they were issued in breach of the rights of the defence, in particular as they were not allowed to present submissions as provided for in law, neither in respect of the challenge nor in respect of the constitutional complaint. Furthermore, the decisions had lacked reasons and made no reference to the actual position of the applicants and a lack of reasoning in respect of the rejection of the constitutional complaint was particularly detrimental as it did not allow a proper examination of the matter by the third-instance judge."

Only remedies that allowed an individual to raise the alleged violation and could afford, to the person concerned, the opportunity to put an end to the breach, to prevent the possible adverse effects or, as appropriate, to obtain adequate redress in a specific form or by equivalent, had to be exhausted. Thus, the adequacy and effectiveness of a remedy (for the purposes of exhaustion) was inextricably linked to the correlative power, in the hands of the court hearing the case, to take preventive measures or, as appropriate, measures of restoration of the established violations. They considered that the civil remedy invoked by the Government could not be considered effective in their case, as it could not prevent the harmful consequences complained of nor put an end to the alleged violation. They further noted that even assuming they could obtain compensation for damage resulting from a violation of their Article 8 rights – an improbable scenario, given that the measure appeared to have been legitimately adopted on the basis of the laws in force and was considered valid and productive of effects by the domestic courts - they were also complaining that they had no access to a court to challenge the lawfulness of the exequatur decision affecting their rights.

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this criterion hinges on the idea that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, 1 July 2010). The assessment of this minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Korolev, cited above, and Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 55, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above ). Thus, the absence of any such disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu v. Romania (dec .) no. 36659/04, § 34, 1 June 2010, Rinck v. France (dec.) no. 18774/09, 19 October 2010; and Kiousi v. Greece (dec.) no. 52036/09, 20 September 2011).

In particular, both the storing and the release of information related to private life, coupled with a refusal to allow an opportunity to refute it, amounts to an interference under Article 8 (see Leander v.

Likewise, a generic need to prosecute crime did not render the measure legitimate in relation to persons who were not involved in the offences which were being investigated and which concerned documents totally irrelevant to demonstrating whether the charges against those actually subject to an investigation were well-founded.

Domestic case-law (order of the Judge of Appeals of 3 June 1988, proceedings no. 392/1998) also provided that the forced collection of evidence through search and seizure could also be ordered in respect of parties not subject to investigation, who even if innocent are subject to servitutes justitiae, where the goods relate to investigation or charges concerning others.

On the contrary, such decisions were based on a consistent and reasonable interpretation of the reference rules, namely law no. 104/2009 and Articles 187 and 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Criminal case ‑ law had interpreted the latter as allowing only the accused persons, the prosecutor, namely the Attorney General ( Procuratore del Fisco ) and the civil party, to appeal and with specific reference to seizures also the third party subject to a precautionary measure (sic.). Pointing to Article 30 ( 3 ) of law no. 104/2009 on international letters rogatory - which provided that any complaint envisaged by domestic law against exequatur orders establishing coercive measures were to be admitted - the Government noted that the term “interested persons” had necessarily to be interpreted as “parties involved under the legislation on complaints envisaged by domestic law” and they stressed that the special legislation on letters rogatory did not introduce any particular and special remedies regulated by specific rules. On the contrary, that legislation established that existing remedies should be used for that purpose and it described the specific rules of procedure to be applied for such remedies. The Government submitted two domestic judgments in the same context and concerning the same letters rogatory delivered in 2011 (judgments of the third-instance criminal judge of 2 March 2011 and 5 July 2011) which confirmed that law no. 104/09 was not intended to introduce a system of ad hoc remedies in relation to coercive measures in the ambit of letters rogatory, but simply referred to the system of remedies already envisaged in the Code of Criminal Procedure, which were available only to the parties involved."

However, the Court would recall that it is not its task to substitute itself for the domestic jurisdictions. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see Anghel v. Italy, no. 5968/09, § 82, 25 June 2013 ). The Court ’ s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, in the context of Article 6, inter alia, Waite and Kennedy v.

It follows that it is not disputed that the procedure attempted by the applicant was not in fact available to him. It is also noted that the applicant ’ s claims as to the constitutional legitimacy of such a finding were also rejected for lack of standing. The Court reiterates that the institution of proceedings does not, in itself, satisfy all the access to court requirements of Article 6 § 1 (see, for example, Sukhorubchenko v. Russia, no. 69315/01, § 43, 10 February 2005 ), it follows from this that, contrary to what was submitted by the Government, the mere fact that the applicant instituted those proceedings, which were then rejected for lack of standing, does not in itself satisfy the requirement of effective control under Article 8."

In so far as the Government suggested that the applicant could have pursued an ordinary civil remedy, the Court observes that the Government have not shown, by means of examples or effective and substantiated argumentation, that such a remedy could have examined the applicant ’ s challenges to the exequatur decision in a timely procedure, or that it could have, if necessary, annulled the said order or its consequences in respect of the applicant. Similarly, while the Convention is incorporated in San Marino law and is directly applicable in San Marino, the Government have not furnished any example of a litigant having successfully relied on the Convention to apply to a domestic authority in order to obtain redress in similar circumstances. Moreover, it is unclear – and the Government have not explained – what procedure would have been followed and what would have been the legal effect of such a complaint (see also, Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, § 64, 23 September 2004 ). The Court considers that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of a remedy with examples of domestic case-law, but it is ready to accept that this may be more difficult in smaller jurisdictions, such as in the present case, where the number of cases of a specific kind may be fewer than in the larger jurisdictions (see Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, § 63, 23 July 2013). However, in the present case the exequatur decision affected more than a thousand persons ( see paragraph 10 above) and the Government have not demonstrated at least one example of such a remedy being undertaken by any of the affected persons in the applicant ’ s position. In any event, the Court has already held that a claim for damages against the State in an action before the ordinary courts is clearly distinct from – and should not be confused with – an application for judicial review. Accordingly, it would not have been a remedy capable of achieving the aim sought by the applicant of having the impugned search and seizure, or its consequences, annulled and could therefore not be regarded as an “effective review” for the purposes of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, Xavier Da Silveira, cited above, § 48; and Pruteanu v.

Thus, the Court finds that, despite the wide extent of the measure which had been applied extensively and across to all banking and fiduciary institutes in San Marino, the applicant did not have available to him the “effective control” to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law and which would have been capable of restricting the interference in question to what was “necessary in a democratic society”."

This in their view resulted in yet another denial of access to court in relation to this matter.

However, in this case, the refusal to start the procedure for the assessment of the constitutional legitimacy cannot be considered as arbitrary, as it was justified on the basis of the applicant ’ s lack of entitlement to bring an action in the proceedings a quo.

They considered that Article 6 in its criminal head should also apply to the present case as the Court ’ s case law had established that Article 6 started to apply from the moment an individual ’ s position was affected. That criterion had been fulfilled in their case given that they were affected by the measure despite not yet being under investigation. They contended that the act itself was aimed at naming persons involved with S. M. I, irrespective of their involvement with the facts object of the letters rogatory. Indeed the Commissario ’ s decision had clearly stated that SMI ’ s dealings suggested that the persons involved (the applicants took this to refer also to them) sought to escape anti-laundering verifications, a signal of the doubtful origins of legal titles ( titoli ). Similarly, the Commissario ’ s subsequent decision had stated that the investigation could affect third parties who were not charged. The applicants therefore contended that the Commissario had aimed at obtaining coercively the information related to them, thus by-passing banking secrecy, with the aim of eventually charging other individuals. They claimed that the possibility under San Marino law for the judge to authorise the use of such documentation for purposes not related to the object of the letters rogatory, meant that proceedings against the applicants could be initiated on the basis of those documents, contrary to their right to the presumption of innocence and the right not to incriminate oneself, them being denied any procedural guarantees.

That was the case not only in respect of applications lodged after the date on which the Act came into force, but also of those which were already on the Court ’ s list of cases by that date.

                "“ 2. The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...",
                "As stipulated in section 2 ( 1 ) of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the ‘ violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the “ reasonable time ” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ’. In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said Court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.",
                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",
                "7. In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of compensation for non-pecuniary damage payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable - time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (Court HR, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy ). ”",

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his possessions ( see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 38, Series A no. 332; The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § § 89-90, ECHR 2000- XII; and Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 73)."

They reiterated in that connection that the judgments of the Constitutional Court were of “ retrospective ” scope: laws declared unconstitutional became ineffective and the laws previously in force were “revived” ( see paragraphs 4 7 -56 above ). They thus acknowledged that the judgments of the Constitutional Court had had the effect of annulling the two laws in question from the outset, and this had “revived” the provision of the general expropriation law of 1865, which had immediately come back into force.

From that standpoint, the declarations of unconstitutionality had created a “ vacuum ”, since the fact that the Law of 1865 had come back into force did not correspond to the political, economic and social demands guiding the legislature.

It was therefore debatable to what extent a supranational body could intervene in this process. It was, rather, commonly accepted that in most cases the facts would have been established by the domestic courts and that the Court ’ s task would be limited to examining whether the Convention had been complied with. The Court ’ s case-law appeared to be confined to assessing whether the domestic courts ’ decisions, given in accordance with domestic procedure previously approved by the Court, had properly applied the general rules to the specific case. In the absence of precise indicators on which to assess the facts and calculate the amount of compensation, there were no grounds on which to dispute the decisions of the domestic courts.

Moreover, although Article 6 of the Convention guaranteed the right to a fair trial, it did not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or its assessment, which was therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law by the domestic courts. Accordingly, when examining decisions of domestic courts on the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage arising from delays in proceedings, the Court should leave enough room for the courts ’ discretion in this respect since the domestic courts decided on delays in the proceedings on the basis of the same criteria as the Court – and were in a better position to analyse the causes and consequences and thus to determine the non-pecuniary damage on an equitable basis."

On the one hand it encouraged States to find their own, universally accessible, solution to the problem, and on the other hand it allowed applicants to avoid being penalised for the lack of domestic remedies."

Germany, 16 September 1996, § 55, Reports 1996- IV, and Bottazzi, cited above, § 22). Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy of the type provided for under Italian law for example."

The Court reiterates that in many cases of lawful expropriation, such as a distinct expropriation of land with a view to building a road or for other purposes “in the public interest”, only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property (see The former King of Greece and Others ( just satisfaction), cited above, § 78 ).

As the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as the lapse of a considerable period of time (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis, cited above, § 82, and, mutatis mutandis, Motais de Narbonne v. France ( just satisfaction), no. 48161/99, §§ 20-21, 27 May 2003 ), once the amount obtained at domestic level is deducted, and the difference with the market value of the land in 1983 thus obtained, that amount will have to be converted to current value to offset the effects of inflation. Moreover, interest will have to be paid on this amount so as to offset, at least in part, the long period for which the applicants have been deprived of the land. In the Court ’ s opinion the interest should take the form of simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted. With regard, lastly, to the 20% tax deducted from the expropriation compensation awarded at domestic level, the Grand Chamber, like the Chamber, has not found the application of that tax to be unlawful as such but has taken account of that factor in assessing the facts ( see paragraph 101 above )."

The change of position of the persons in the line-up did not result in any different outcome for the applicants, as they were consistently required to wear the same colour (white and blue) balaclavas (see paragraph 13 above).

While the arrangements for national-school education might “seem rather odd today”, they had to be understood in the context of Irish history in the early nineteenth century. Following denominational conflict and the later concession of Catholic emancipation in 1829, the dissenting churches and the Catholic Church wished to ensure that children of their denominations be educated in schools controlled by the denomination and not by the State or the established (Anglican) Church. Those churches were “remarkably successful” in achieving this aim: from the very beginning of the Irish system of national education (encapsulated in the “Stanley letter” of 1831), State authorities paid for the system of national education “but did not manage it or administer it at the point of delivery”. The latter function was left to the local denominational manager. While State funding was accorded on a proportionate basis to all denominational schools, the population was at the time overwhelmingly Catholic so that the majority of national schools had Catholic patrons and managers."

Hardiman J went on to describe as “remarkable” the fact that, whilst in nineteenth-century Europe firmer distinctions were being drawn between Church and State and Church influence in the provision of public services (including education) was ebbing, in Ireland the position of the Church became stronger and more entrenched. He adopted the evidence of one expert witness (in the history of education in Ireland) who described the position after the inception of the Irish Free State in 1922 and noted that the Catholic managers in this “managerial” system",
                "“were very clearly articulate and very absolutely ... precise in how they interpreted what the situation was for national schools in the new Ireland ... It had to be Catholic schools under Catholic management, Catholic teachers, Catholic children”."

That expert witness went on to describe the answer of the Catholic Church in the 1950s to a request by a teachers’ trade union to have local committees deal with maintaining and repairing school buildings. The Catholic Church had responded that there could be no interference whatever with the “inherited tradition of managerial rights of schooling”. The limited proposal of the union was considered to be the thin edge of the wedge because, in due course, the request might be to interfere with “other aspects of the manager’s authority vis-à-vis the appointment and dismissal of teachers which was of course the key concern that had been fought for and won over the years”. Hardiman J referred to the “urgent desire” of the denominations to maintain their role in primary education."

As a result there were approximately 3,000 national schools in Ireland: most were under the control of Catholic patrons and managers, a few were under the control of other denominations and even fewer were controlled by non-denominational groups."

He inspected the schools for their academic performance, other than religious instruction, but it did not go further than that. He was ... deprived of the direct control of the schools, and of the enormous power which that brings, because ‘there was interposed between the State and the child the manager or the committee or board of management’. Equally, the Minister did not appoint the manager or the teacher or directly supervise him. This, indeed, was the essence of the ‘managerial system’. I cannot see, on the evidence, that he had any scope whatever to make a personal judgment about either of these two individuals. Moreover, it seems to have been instinctively recognised by the parents who complained about the first defendant that the person with direct authority to receive the complaint and do something about it was the clerical and clerically appointed manager. No complaint, on the evidence, was directed to the Minister or to any State body. The matter was handled, so to speak, ‘in house’ at the election of the complainants. The end result of the process was a voluntary resignation followed by the employment of [L.H.] in another school in the vicinity.",
                "All these factors tending to distance the Minister and the State authorities from the management of the school and the control of the first defendant are direct consequences of the long established system of education, described above and mandated in the Constitution whereby the Minister pays and, to a certain extent, regulates, but the schools and the teachers are controlled by their clerical managers and patrons. It is not the concern of the Court either to endorse or to criticise that system but merely to register its existence and the obvious fact that it deprives the Minister and the State of direct control of schools, teachers, and pupils.”"

The Minister is thereby, as Kenny J pointed out in Crowley v. Ireland [1980] I.R. 102, deprived of the control of education by the interposing of the patron and the manager between him and the children.

L.H. was not employed by the State but, in law, by the manager.

Since she did not appeal to the Supreme Court the order of the High Court to the effect that she had not established a case in negligence (the “non-suit” order), the State was deprived of the opportunity to contest the negligence claims, with its evidence, in the proper domestic forum. As a result, much controversial material had been opened before this Court without the necessary domestic court analysis. The Government were not suggesting that, having unsuccessfully pursued one remedy, she should have begun another but rather that she should not have abandoned at the High Court stage an appeal concerning her core complaint to this Court."

If the applicant considered the CICT award inadequate, she should have taken an action in judicial review. That the CICT award was lower than that of the High Court did not mean it was inadequate: the higher award could be explained by additional information before the civil courts or by the differing elements comprising the respective awards.

She argued that the award was inadequate as demonstrated by the difference between it and the significantly greater civil award against LH (the core non-pecuniary award against LH was EUR 200,000 as well as EUR 100,000 in aggravated and exemplary damages and the non-pecuniary element of the CICT award was EUR 27,000). Judicial review of the CICT award stood no chance of success in which case she risked a heavy costs’ order against her: there had been approximately 5 such cases since 1982 and the scope of judicial review was too narrow to accommodate a simple disagreement over the amount of the award."

It could not be said that the outcome of that action was clearly foreseeable since her action was a lead case in the domestic courts and since it ended with a majority judgment of the Supreme Court. If successful, that action could have addressed her essential grievances through a finding of State responsibility and an award of damages against the State. While the basis of State responsibility invoked domestically was different to that pursued before the Court, the Court’s case-law made it clear that the applicant had the right, consistently with Article 35, to pursue the vicarious liability action with a view to addressing her grievance against the State without being required, when the route reasonably chosen proved unsuccessful, to exhaust another remedy with essentially the same objective."

Calvelli and Ciglio concerned medical negligence so that a civil negligence action against doctors (and, potentially, disciplinary proceedings) was considered adequate for the purposes of the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention.

However, it was made on an ex gratia basis and did not concern in any way, let alone acknowledge, any liability of the State. Consistently with this fact, the State is never a party to CICT proceedings ( Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 109; E. and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 33218/96, § 112, 26 November 2002; and August v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36505/02, 21 January 2003)."

While the CICT award (EUR 54,000) included a non-pecuniary element (EUR 27,000), that was very substantially lower than the non-pecuniary damage assessed by the High Court at EUR 200,000 (for example, Scordino v.

Dunderrow National School was therefore owned, operated and managed by the Catholic Church and its representatives. L.H. was not a State employee but was employed by the manager who, in turn, managed the school on behalf of the patron. This was not a technical bureaucratic distinction but a real “ceding” of the ownership and management of schools to denominations. This situation suited the majority and minority denominations, it reflected the will of the Irish people and it was not the function of this Court to recast the relationships which formed the basis of a significant portion of the Irish primary-school system. The suggestion that primary education was a national enterprise to be entirely State run in an advanced democratic State stemmed from a particular ideological outlook that was not necessarily shared by all Contracting States and not by Ireland.

State responsibility for criminal offences unrelated to securing a Convention right was therefore limited to an operational obligation to protect (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII) and there was no evidence that the State knew or ought reasonably to have known in 1973 of a real risk of a teacher abusing a pupil or of L.H. abusing the applicant."

The core question was what ought to have been the perceived risk of sexual abuse of children by teachers in primary schools in Ireland in the early 1970s and the answer was none. The Government pointed out the reference by Hardiman J to the different ethos which existed in the 1970s which explained why no parent had made a direct complaint to the State authorities at the relevant time. The Government relied also on the research paper entitled “Residential Child Care in England, 1948-1975: A History And Report” annexed to the Ryan Report. The applicant herself had presented no evidence to the domestic courts as to the level of awareness of risk in the 1970s and, indeed, her own expert (Professor Ferguson) considered that there was no evidence to support the need for preventative strategies in the early 1970s. The Carrigan Report did not assist her: while it contained some information about an increase in sexual crime and indicated that the police were active in prosecuting such crimes against young girls, there was no suggestion that a girl was at risk in school from a teacher. While the Government accepted that the Department had mishandled a complaint about Mr Brander, one could not extrapolate from this a constructive knowledge on the part of the State in the 1970s of a general risk to children from sexual abuse in schools.

The Government relied, in particular, on Rules 121 and 130, which set down standards for teachers conduct, as well as Rule 108 and the Guidance Note of 6 May 1970 as regards mechanisms to deal with teachers who did not conduct themselves properly. Moreover, the inspector’s role was, inter alia, to report to the Minister on the quality of the system and, notably, on whether the 1965 Rules were being complied with and to ensure an “appropriate standard of education” in all primary schools. In addition, each manager, teacher and parent had a role in protecting children and each could have made, but did not make in the applicant’s case, a complaint directly to an inspector, the Minister, the Department or to the police. Any such complaint would have led to relevant inquiries and investigations, and, as appropriate, a sanction such as the withdrawal by the Minister of a teacher’s licence to teach. The real problem was that no use was made of the procedures which existed: the earlier complaint about L.H. was made to the manager and not to a State authority."

In this context, the IHRC considered that a serious question arose as to whether the State maintained a sufficient level of control over publicly funded national schools to ensure that Convention rights were upheld. The legal status of the 1965 Rules was unclear. The Rules were unclear about an inspector’s role as regards a teacher’s conduct and, while the Rules addressed “improper conduct” by teachers, they did not define this or indicate any process whatsoever for dealing with it. Since private fee-paying schools and home schooling were not options accessible to the vast majority of Irish parents, rendering primary education obligatory effectively required parents to send their children to national schools, failing which they risked criminal proceedings, fines and the possibility of children being taken into care. In sum, in a typical national school, which most Irish children inevitably attended, school management had little guidance as to how to deal with allegations or suspicions of abuse, schools were under no duty to report such allegations to the Department or to the police, social services had limited powers to deal with any such allegations or suspicions and, finally, children and parents faced difficulties making any such complaints.",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The obligation on High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals. This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every risk of ill-treatment could entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take measures to prevent that risk from materialising. However, the required measures should, at least, provide effective protection in particular of children and other vulnerable persons and should include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, §§ 21-27, Series A no. 91; A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports 1998 ‑ VI; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, [no. 29392/95], §§ 74-75[, ECHR 2001 ‑ V]; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 109, 10 October 2002; and M.C. v.

The formulation used in Marckx v. Belgium (13 June 1979, § 31, Series A no. 31) to describe the positive obligations under Article 8 to ensure a child’s integration into a family, has been often cited (notably, in Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, pp. 30-31, § 25, Series A no. 32). Most pertinently, the seminal case of X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, found that the absence of legislation criminalising sexual advances to a mentally handicapped adolescent meant that the State had failed to fulfil a positive obligation to protect the Article 8 rights of the victim. In so concluding, the Court rejected the Government’s argument to the effect that the facts were “exceptional” and that the legislative gap was unforeseeable. The respondent State should have been aware of a risk of sexual abuse of mentally handicapped adolescents in a privately run care home for children and should have legislated for that eventuality. Those cases concerned facts prior to or contemporaneous with those of the present application.",

Importantly, the nature of child sexual abuse is such, particularly when the abuser is in a position of authority over the child, that the existence of useful detection and reporting mechanisms are fundamental to the effective implementation of the relevant criminal laws (see Juppala v. Finland, no. 18620/03, § 42, 2 December 2008). The Court would clarify that it considers, as did the Government, that there was no evidence before the Court of an operational failure to protect the applicant (see Osman, cited above, §§ 115-16).

Primary education was obligatory (sections 4 and 17 of the School Attendance Act 1926) and few parents had the resources to use the two other schooling options (home schooling or travelling to attend the rare fee-paying primary schools), whereas national schools were free and the national-school network was extensive. There were four national schools in the applicant’s parish and no information was submitted as to the distance to the nearest fee-paying school. In any event, the State cannot be released from its positive obligation to protect simply because a child selects one of the State-approved education options, whether a national school, a fee-paying school or, indeed, home schooling (see Costello-Roberts, cited above, § 27)."

Religious bodies owned national schools (as patrons) and managed them (as managers). As pointed out by Hardiman J, the management of national schools by religious bodies was not just an authorisation by the State to take part in the provision of primary education but rather it was a “ceding” of the running of national schools to the denominational actors and to their interests, which bodies were interposed between the State and the child. The Minister for Education did not, therefore, have any direct or day-to-day management or control of national schools (see paragraphs 35 and 40 above). As observed by Hardiman J and Fennelly J in the Supreme Court, the denominations expressed their firm wish to retain that national-school model of primary education and their control of that system. Since the purpose of the denominations was to ensure that their ethos was reflected in the schools, national schools developed into a predominantly denominational system: accordingly, a Catholic-managed national school generally referred to a Catholic manager (usually the local parish priest) with Catholic teachers and pupils (see Hardiman J and Fennelly J, at paragraphs 31-32 and 43 above)."

Based on information he had gathered from 800 police stations in Ireland, he concluded that there was an alarming amount of sexual crime in Ireland, a feature of which was the large number of cases concerning minors including children under 10 years of age. Indeed, this witness considered prosecutions to represent a fraction of the offences actually taking place. Drawing a causal connection between the frequency of assaults on children and the impunity expected by abusers, the Committee’s report recommended legislative changes and more severe punishments leading to the adoption of the 1935 Act which, inter alia, created certain sexual offences as regards young girls. Professor Ferriter’s report, sponsored by the Ryan Commission and annexed to its report (see paragraph 82 above), analysed the statistical evidence of prosecutions gathered from criminal-court archives covering the period after the Carrigan Report and until the 1960s. In his report, he concluded, inter alia, that those archives demonstrated a high level of sexual crime directed against young boys and girls. Lastly, the Ryan Report also evidenced complaints made to State authorities prior to and during the 1970s about the sexual abuse of children by adults (see paragraphs 78-81 above). While that report primarily concerned industrial schools where the programme was different from national schools and where the resident children were isolated from families and the community (see the description of industrial schools at paragraph 73 above), these earlier complaints still amounted to notice to the State of sexual abuse by adults of minors in an educational context.

Those should, at a minimum, have included effective mechanisms for the detection and reporting of any ill-treatment by and to a State-controlled body, such procedures being fundamental to the enforcement of the criminal laws, to the prevention of such ill-treatment and, more generally therefore, to the fulfilment of the positive protective obligation of the State (see paragraph 148 above)."

There was no specific reference, in the instruments on which the Government relied, to an obligation on inspectors to inquire into or to monitor a teacher’s treatment of children, to any opportunity for children or parents to complain directly to an inspector, to a requirement to give notice to parents in advance of an inspector’s visit or, indeed, to any direct interaction between an inspector and pupils and/or their parents. The rate of visits by inspectors (see paragraph 61 above) did not attest to any local presence of relevance. Consistently with this fact, the Government did not submit any information about complaints made to an inspector about a teacher’s ill-treatment of a child. As pointed out by Hardiman J in the Supreme Court, the Minister (via his inspectors) inspected the schools for their academic performance but it did not go further than that: the Minister was deprived of the direct control of the schools because the non-State manager was interposed between the State and the child (see paragraph 35 above)."

There were over 400 incidents of abuse concerning L.H. since the mid-1960s in Dunderrow National School.

The inspector assigned to that school made six visits from 1969 to 1973 and no complaint was ever made to him about L.H. Indeed, no complaint about L.H.’s activities was made to a State authority until 1995, after L.H. had retired. Any system of detection and reporting which allowed such extensive and serious ill-conduct to continue for so long must be considered to be ineffective (see C.A.S. and C.S. v.

In the present case, once a complaint about the sexual abuse by L.H. of a child from Dunderrow National School was made to the police in 1995, the investigation opened. The applicant was contacted for a statement which she made in early 1997 and she was referred for counselling (see, for example, C.A.S. and C.S. v. Romania, § 82). L.H. was charged on 386 counts of sexual abuse involving twenty-one pupils from Dunderrow National School. L.H. pleaded guilty to twenty-one sample charges. He was convicted and imprisoned. It is not clear from the submissions whether the applicant’s case was included in the sample charges: however, she did not take any issue with the fact that L.H. was allowed to plead guilty to representative charges or with his sentence.

They argued that the length of the proceedings had been excessive in all the cases concerned (for instance, in one case civil proceedings had lasted nearly nine years for two levels of jurisdiction) and that the legal remedies available had been of no avail because the claims were dismissed or no violation was found.

It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 192, ECHR 2004 -V )."

The characteristics of an effective remedy are to be found in the Court's case-law cited in this judgment.",

                "“39. The six-month time-limit provided for by Article 35 § 1 has a number of aims. Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 6638/03, 24 August 2004). It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see O ’ Loughlin and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 23274/04, 25 August 2005) and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (see Nee v. Ireland ( dec. ), no. 52787/99, 30 January 2003).",
                "40. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I). The existence of such a time-limit is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question and constitutes a legitimate concern for order, stability and peace (see De Becker v. Belgium ( dec. ), no. 214/56, 9 June 1958).",
                "41. Article 35 § 1 contains an autonomous rule which has to be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to ensure to any applicant claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the Contracting Parties of one of the rights set forth in the Convention and its Protocols the effective exercise of the right of individual petition pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Worm v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 22714/93, 27 November 1995).",
                "42. The Court reiterates that with regard to procedure and time-limits, legal certainty constitutes a binding requirement which ensures the equality of litigants before the law. That principle is implicit in all the Convention ’ s Articles and constitutes one of the fundamental elements of the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Beian v. Romania (no. 1), no. 30658/05, § 39, ECHR 2007 ‑ V (extracts)).”"

Moreover, some indication of the factual basis of the complaint and the nature of the alleged violation of the Convention is required to introduce a complaint and interrupt the running of the six-month period (see Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, § 222, 2 December 2010, and Allan v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 48539/99, 28 August 2001). As regards complaints that were not included in the initial communication, the running of the six-month period is not interrupted until the date when such complaints are first submitted to the Court (see Allan, cited above)."

The Court has previously found a new complaint submitted for the first time in the applicant ’ s observations on the admissibility and merits of the case to have been introduced outside the six-month time-limit, in breach of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Fábián, cited above, § 98; Messochoritis v. Greece ( dec. ), no. 41867/98, 15 June 2000; Ekimdjiev v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), no. 47092/99, 3 March 2005; and Majski v. Croatia, no. 33593/03, § 34, 1 June 2006). The Court reiterates that the principle ne eat judex ultra et extra petita partium (“not beyond the request”) is one of the fundamental principles of procedure under international and domestic (civil and administrative) law, it being understood that the petitum is the complaint submitted by the applicant. It follows that the scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 108-09 and 120-22). Allegations made after the expiry of the six-month time-limit can only be examined by the Court if they constitute legal submissions relating to, or particular aspects of, the initial complaints that were introduced within the time-limit (see Kurnaz and Others v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 36672/97, 7 December 2004; Sâmbata Bihor Greco-Catholic Parish v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 48107/99, 25 May 2004; and Fábián, cited above, § 94).",

Hence, any appeal will be aimed at obtaining a declaration that the impugned act is null and void or non - existent, rather than a fresh assessment of the criteria employed by the administrative body or of the question whether those criteria were applied correctly, with particular regard to the establishment of the key facts ... The position taken by the Judicial Division is that, although the Supreme Court has the power to assess and sanction a failure to take necessary and relevant steps in disciplinary proceedings, it cannot take the place of the competent administrative body – the CSM – in gathering the evidence ( aquisição da matéria instrutória ) or establishing the key facts.

                "“39. The six-month time-limit provided for by Article 35 § 1 has a number of aims. Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 6638/03, 24 August 2004). It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see O ’ Loughlin and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 23274/04, 25 August 2005) and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (see Nee v. Ireland ( dec. ), no. 52787/99, 30 January 2003).",
                "40. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I). The existence of such a time-limit is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question and constitutes a legitimate concern for order, stability and peace (see De Becker v. Belgium ( dec. ), no. 214/56, 9 June 1958).",
                "41. Article 35 § 1 contains an autonomous rule which has to be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to ensure to any applicant claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the Contracting Parties of one of the rights set forth in the Convention and its Protocols the effective exercise of the right of individual petition pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Worm v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 22714/93, 27 November 1995).",
                "42. The Court reiterates that with regard to procedure and time-limits, legal certainty constitutes a binding requirement which ensures the equality of litigants before the law. That principle is implicit in all the Convention ’ s Articles and constitutes one of the fundamental elements of the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Beian v.

The Court reiterates that the principle ne eat judex ultra et extra petita partium (“not beyond the request”) is one of the fundamental principles of procedure under international and domestic (civil and administrative) law, it being understood that the petitum is the complaint submitted by the applicant. It follows that the scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 108-09 and 120-22). Allegations made after the expiry of the six-month time-limit can only be examined by the Court if they constitute legal submissions relating to, or particular aspects of, the initial complaints that were introduced within the time-limit (see Kurnaz and Others v.

Regarding the existence of a “right”, it observed that the proceedings in question had been decisive for the applicant ’ s rights in so far as they could have led to the setting-aside of the disciplinary sanctions imposed by the CSM if the domestic courts had allowed her appeals. As to the “civil” nature of such a right, the Chamber found that the first condition of the test established in the judgment in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007-II) had not been met, as domestic law – in the form of section 168 of the Act (see paragraph 71 above) – made provision for persons with an interest in bringing proceedings to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court challenging the lawfulness of a decision by the CSM to impose a disciplinary penalty on a judge. The applicant had in fact made use of that option. Accordingly, the Chamber held that Article 6 was applicable under its civil head. In view of that finding, the Chamber did not consider it necessary to ascertain whether that provision was applicable in the present case under its criminal head, and decided not to examine the complaints submitted in that regard."

With regard to the extent of the review conducted by the Supreme Court, the Chamber noted that the latter had been empowered to review the lawfulness of the CSM ’ s decisions imposing disciplinary penalties on the applicant. In the course of that review it could verify the validity of the evidence, whether the facts had been adequately and coherently established, and whether the penalty imposed had been reasonable and proportionate. It could therefore set aside the decision on several grounds of unlawfulness linked to the procedural or substantive requirements laid down by law and refer the case back to the CSM for a fresh ruling in conformity with any instructions issued by the Supreme Court regarding possible irregularities.",

Furthermore, it could not reconsider the penalty imposed, but could only determine whether the penalty had been appropriate to the offence and proportionate to it. For that reason, in the Chamber ’ s view, the case was to be likened to situations in which the national courts had been unable or had refused to examine a key issue in the dispute because they had considered themselves bound by the findings of fact or of law made by the administrative authorities and could not examine the relevant issues independently. In the instant case the Supreme Court had confined itself to conducting a review of lawfulness with regard to the establishment of the facts and had thus not properly addressed important arguments advanced by the applicant concerning questions of fact that were crucial to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

The Chamber concluded from this that the Supreme Court adopted a restrictive approach to the extent of its own jurisdiction to review the disciplinary activities of the CSM, and that the review carried out in the cases concerning the applicant had therefore been insufficient."

The protection of the applicant ’ s dignity had not been an issue, as she herself had requested a public hearing. Moreover, the reasons given by the Supreme Court had been insufficient to justify the refusal to examine the witness whom the applicant wished to have called and whose evidence, in the Chamber ’ s view, had been relevant to the case. That refusal had led ultimately to a limitation of the applicant ’ s ability to defend her case and had undermined the transparency which that procedural act would have lent to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

                "122. The Court reiterates that the concept of a “criminal charge” in Article 6 § 1 is an autonomous one. The Court ’ s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria”, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, among other authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, § 30-31, ECHR 2006-XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003-X). The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no. 23470/05, § 26, 3 April 2012)."

The fact that these are applied, as appropriate, in conjunction with the provisions of the Criminal Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above) does not alter this finding. Furthermore, the proceedings were conducted by a management and disciplinary body – the CSM – subject to the subsequent supervision of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, and neither the prosecuting authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Brown, cited above ) nor the criminal courts were involved in determining the cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 43)."

Such provisions are designed to protect the profession ’ s honour and reputation and to maintain public trust in the judiciary (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 45).

In such circumstances, in the applicant ’ s submission, the aforementioned ad hoc division was not, and could not appear to the public to be, separate from the CSM."

Contrary to the provisions of the Constitution (see Article 212 § 3 of the Constitution, paragraph 70 above), which required disputes concerning administrative acts to be determined by the administrative courts, the disciplinary decisions of the CSM were subject to appeal before an ad hoc division of the Supreme Court. Thus, the appraisal, appointment and promotion of Supreme Court judges, and disciplinary proceedings concerning them, came within the remit of the CSM, in other words the body whose decisions were submitted to those judges for review. Accordingly, in the applicant ’ s view, it would have been wiser for the appeals in question to be adjudicated by the Supreme Administrative Court, whose members came under the authority of the High Council of the Administrative and Fiscal Courts rather than that of the CSM."

Secondly, the composition of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court was determined by law on the basis of objective criteria such as judges ’ seniority and their membership of a particular division, and was therefore not dependent on the wishes of the President of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the members were formally appointed by the most senior Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The President did not participate in sittings at which appeals against CSM decisions were being examined."

Its members were highly qualified judges in the final stages of their careers, who were no longer subject to performance appraisals or in search of promotion. Furthermore, the Supreme Court enjoyed administrative autonomy. The only issue that could arise in practice concerned the CSM ’ s – purely theoretical – power to open disciplinary proceedings against the judges of the Judicial Division."

Fifthly, the appropriateness, coherence and proper functioning of the system in place in Portugal were demonstrated by the fact that, over the period from 16 November 2009 to 31 December 2015, the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court had delivered sixty-one judgments on appeal against disciplinary decisions of the CSM. The CSM ’ s decision had been upheld in fifty-three cases and overturned in eight."

In order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered to be “independent” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 73, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, and Tsanova-Gecheva, cited above, § 106, 15 September 2015). The Court observes that the notion of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in its case-law (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 78, ECHR 2002-IV). However, neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ’ interaction (see Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98 and 3 others, § 193, ECHR 2003-VI)."

According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 93, ECHR 2009)."

France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 75, 2 3 April 2015 ). However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, § 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996-III)."

                "147. As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, § 96, and Morice, cited above, § 76)."
            ],
            [
                "148. The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings (see Micallef, cited above, § 97). It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Pullar, cited above, § 38)."

Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 26, Series A no. 86). What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-VIII, and Micallef, cited above, § 98)."

In particular, it is not established that those judges were specially appointed with a view to adjudicating her case (see, mutatis mutandis, Pereira da Silva v. Portugal, no. 77050/11, §§ 59-60, 22 March 2016).

With regard to the second aspect of the complaint, the Court observes that in the case of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above), it previously examined a similar issue concerning the impartiality and independence of the Higher Administrative Court (HAC), whose task it was to examine appeals against decisions of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice (HCJ). In that case the Court found as follows:",
                "“130. The Court observes that the judicial review was performed by judges of the HAC who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that these judges could also be subjected to disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. Having regard to the extensive powers of the HCJ with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal) and the lack of safeguards for the HCJ ’ s independence and impartiality ( as examined above), the Court is not persuaded that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant ’ s case, to which the HCJ was a party, were able to demonstrate the ‘ independence and impartiality ’ required by Article 6 of the Convention.”"

In the Court ’ s view, regard being had to the arguments advanced by the Chamber which examined the case of Oleksandr Volkov, these findings should be regarded as a criticism based on the circumstances of the case and applicable in a system with serious structural deficiencies or an appearance of bias within the disciplinary body for the judiciary, as was the case in the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, rather than as a general conclusion."

                "159. In Oleksandr Volkov, in addition to the fact that the judges of the Higher Administrative Court were under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice, a number of serious issues had been identified. These problems related firstly to structural shortcomings in the procedure before the HCJ, notably the inclusion of the Minister of Justice and of the Prosecutor General as ex officio members of that body and the fact that the great majority of its non-judicial members were appointed directly by the executive and legislative authorities. Secondly, the Court took into account the appearance of bias on the part of some members of the HCJ who had determined the applicant ’ s case. It observed that the members of the Ukrainian HCJ who had carried out the preliminary inquiries in the applicant ’ s case and submitted requests for his dismissal had subsequently taken part in the decisions to remove him from office. Moreover, one of them had been appointed President of the HCJ and had presided over the hearing of the applicant ’ s case. The Court therefore found that the proceedings before the HCJ had been incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality set forth in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 117). The subsequent determination of the applicant ’ s case by Parliament, the legislative body, had not remedied the structural defects of a lack of “independence and impartiality” but rather had served to contribute to the politicisation of the procedure and to aggravate the inconsistency of the procedure with the principle of the separation of powers (ibid., § 118). In those circumstances, according to the Court ’ s case-law, it was extremely important for the Ukrainian Higher Administrative Court to afford the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention in order to be able to remedy any lack of independence and impartiality."

The Court emphasises at the outset the importance of the guarantees listed at paragraph 153 above, in particular the principle of independence of the judiciary in Portugal, which is protected both under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) and by other provisions of domestic law (see paragraph 71 above). It also takes note of the reasons that prompted the Portuguese legislative authorities to choose the current system whereby jurisdiction over appeals against decisions of the CSM is assigned to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, reasons that have been endorsed on several occasions by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 82 above)."

Furthermore, it goes without saying that the fact that judges are subject to the law in general, and to the rules of professional discipline and ethics in particular, cannot cast doubt on their impartiality. As noted by the Government and not disputed by the applicant, the judges of the Supreme Court, who are highly qualified and often in the final stages of their careers, are no longer subject to performance appraisals or in search of promotion, and the CSM ’ s disciplinary authority over them is in reality rather theoretical (see paragraph 142 above). The Court also notes the absence of any specific evidence of a lack of impartiality, such as, for instance, the existence of pending disciplinary proceedings against one of the members of the benches that examined the applicant ’ s appeals. In more general terms the Court considers it normal that judges, in the performance of their judicial duties and in various contexts, should have to examine a variety of cases in the knowledge that they may themselves, at some point in their careers, be in a similar position to one of the parties, including the defendant. However, a purely abstract risk of this kind cannot be regarded as apt to cast doubt on the impartiality of a judge in the absence of specific circumstances pertaining to his or her individual situation. Even in the context of disciplinary cases a theoretical risk of this nature, consisting in the fact that judges hearing cases are themselves still subject to a set of disciplinary rules, is not in itself a sufficient basis for finding a breach of the requirements of impartiality."

Referring to various extracts from the Supreme Court ’ s judgments, she highlighted the nature of appeals to that court, which entailed a review of lawfulness rather than a review by a body with full jurisdiction. There was no possibility of effectively re-examining the establishment of the facts, which, in her submission, had been established by the CSM on the basis of insufficient evidence. Likewise, the Supreme Court had not carried out a proper assessment of her disciplinary conduct. Lastly, with regard to the disciplinary penalties imposed, despite finding that it was empowered to examine the severity of each penalty, the Supreme Court had in reality omitted to examine this point on account of the wide discretion afforded to the administrative authorities. While it was true that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention did not guarantee a right of appeal, she had not had access to any level of jurisdiction, as a single administrative entity had been responsible for establishing the facts and determining the disciplinary penalty.

In adopting this approach the Convention organs have had regard to the fact that it is often the case in relation to administrative-law appeals in the member States of the Council of Europe that the extent of judicial review over the facts of a case is limited, and that it is characteristic of review proceedings that the competent authorities review the previous proceedings rather than taking factual decisions. It can be derived from the relevant case-law that it is not the role of Article 6, in principle, to guarantee access to a court which can substitute its own assessment or opinion for that of the administrative authorities. In this regard, the Court has placed particular emphasis on the respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by the administrative authorities on grounds of expediency and which often involve specialised areas of law (see Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 153, and the case-law cited therein)."

The Court considered that the independence of judgment in relation to the finding of primary fact was liable to be impaired in a manner which could not be adequately scrutinised or rectified by judicial review. As the competent court had lacked jurisdiction to rehear the evidence and had therefore been unable to determine a crucial issue of fact, the Court found a violation of Article 6 on the ground that the central issue had not been determined by a tribunal that was independent of the parties. In other words, in that case, the impossibility of re-examining a decisive factual issue had prevented the appellate court from remedying the lack of independence from one of the parties to the dispute that had been found at first instance."

By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Axen v.

Article 6 § 1 does not, however, prohibit courts from deciding, in the light of the special features of the case submitted to them, to derogate from this principle: in accordance with the actual wording of this provision, ‘ ... the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice ’; holding proceedings, whether wholly or partly, in camera must be strictly required by the circumstances of the case (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Diennet v.

It is beyond doubt that, in order to address that issue, the CSM had to exercise its discretionary powers. That authority has specific responsibility under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system (see, mutatis mutandis, Tsanova ‑ Gecheva, cited above, § 100, regarding the power of the Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council to appoint the President of a court). The Court therefore recognises the particular importance of the CSM ’ s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically set up to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of contributing to the smooth operation of the justice system. However, in the instant case, the assessment of the facts and the review of the disciplinary sanctions imposed did not require specialised knowledge or specific professional experience, but could have come within the jurisdiction of any court. This was not a classic exercise of administrative discretion in a specialised area of law (see, conversely, Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 161)."

It considers, firstly, that the review of a decision imposing a disciplinary penalty differs from that of an administrative decision that does not entail such a punitive element. Secondly, it notes that the disciplinary proceedings in question concerned a judge. In that connection the Court stresses that, even if they do not come within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head, disciplinary penalties may nevertheless entail serious consequences for the lives and careers of judges. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10 and 4 others, § 122, 4 March 2014). In accordance with the general principles set forth above and taking into account the policy objectives pursued by the legislation in this sphere (see paragraph 180 above), the Court considers that the judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State initiates such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law. Furthermore, the Court has stressed the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Stafford, § 78; Kleyn, § 193; and Baka, § 165, all cited above).",

As to the procedural safeguards applied by that body, the Court is prepared to accept that, as the Government argued, the proceedings conducted in the present case afforded the applicant the opportunity to mount a defence. The applicant was notified of the indictment drawn up by the judicial investigator (see paragraphs 16, 19, 37 and 52 above) and filed defence pleadings (see paragraphs 17, 21, 37 and 53 above).

Firstly, as the Government acknowledged, the CSM is not authorised by law to hold public hearings, and, secondly, in the third set of proceedings it refused the applicant ’ s request for such a hearing on the grounds, inter alia, that there was no legal basis for the case to be heard in public before the CSM sitting in plenary (see paragraph 56 above). Furthermore, the applicant did not have an opportunity to make oral representations, either on the factual issues and the penalties or on the various legal issues.

It considers that the establishment of the facts is especially important in the case of proceedings that entail the imposition of penalties, and in particular disciplinary penalties against judges, as the latter must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties, so as to ensure public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary as such (see paragraph 196 above).",

It stated expressly that it did not have full jurisdiction in the matter but was called upon solely to review the lawfulness of the decisions under challenge. In particular, it stressed that it did not have jurisdiction when it came to “gathering the evidence ( aquisição da matéria instrutória ) or establishing the key facts” (see paragraph 29 above).",

It could only “examine any contradictions, inconsistencies and insufficiency in the evidence and any manifest errors in the assessment thereof, in so far as these defects [were] apparent” (see paragraph 29 above). According to the definition in its own case-law, a “manifest” error “must not just be serious (a gross error, in that it is manifestly contrary to reason, common sense or the truth, or demonstrates inadequate knowledge); it must also be flagrant (manifest)” (see paragraph 81 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, the dispute as to the facts and the repercussions of the disciplinary penalties on the applicant ’ s reputation made it necessary in the present case for the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court to perform a review that was sufficiently thorough to enable it firstly to determine, for instance, whether the applicant had made certain remarks during her telephone conversation with the judicial inspector H.G. or her private meeting with the judicial investigator F.M.J., and, secondly, to form its own impression of the applicant by affording her an opportunity to explain her version of the situation orally (see, mutatis mutandis, Malhous, § 60; Göç, § 51; Miller, § 34 in fine; Olujić, § 80; and Andersson, § 57, all cited above)."

Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six- month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

This concerns not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the Convention, but also procedural provisions; it impacts on the obligations imposed on respondent Governments, but also has effects on the position of applicants. For example, while it is essential for the efficacy of the system that Contracting States comply with their obligation not to hinder the applicant in the exercise of the right of individual petition, individuals nonetheless bear the responsibility of cooperating with procedures flowing from the introduction of their complaints, assisting in clarifying any factual issues where such lie within their knowledge and in maintaining and supporting the applications introduced on their behalf (see Kapan v. Turkey, no. 22057/93, Commission decision of 13 January 1997, DR 88- A, p. 17 ).

Not all continuing situations are the same; the nature of the situation may be such that the passage of time affects what is at stake. In cases of disappearances, just as it is imperative that the relevant domestic authorities launch an investigation and take measures as soon as a person has disappeared in life-threatening circumstances, it is indispensable that the applicants, who are the relatives of missing persons, do not delay unduly in bringing a complaint about the ineffectiveness or lack of such investigation before the Court. With the lapse of time, memories of witnesses fade, witnesses may die or become untraceable, evidence deteriorates or ceases to exist, and the prospects that any effective investigation can be undertaken will increasingly diminish; and the Court ’ s own examination and judgment may be deprived of meaningfulness and effectiveness. Accordingly, where disappearances are concerned, applicants cannot wait indefinitely before coming to Strasbourg. They must make proof of a certain amount of diligence and initiative and introduce their complaints without undue delay. What this involves is examined below.",

In those cases, there is generally a precise point in time at which death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain. The lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent. Accordingly, the requirements of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case before Strasbourg within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after events. In disappearance cases, where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear cut. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen.

Bearing in mind therefore the consensus that it should be possible to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes even many years after the events, the Court considers that the serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection."

Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided.

If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated. Where more than ten years have elapsed, the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg.

The Court notes that the functioning of the CMP was plagued from inception by disagreements of the parties, lack of cooperation and obstruction. However, information about the progress of the CMP ’ s work was limited due to the strict confidentiality of its procedure. It is apparent that actual work on cases started in 1984 and concrete investigative steps were being taken in the following years. In April 1990 the CMP issued a lengthy press release highlighting fundamental difficulties with hearing witnesses, locating bodies and obtaining disinterments.

                "171. The Court has, in reaching this conclusion, given careful consideration to the respondent Government ’ s submissions concerning the applications introduced by the families of Turkish Cypriots who went missing during inter - communal strife in the 1960 s ( see Baybora and Others and Karabardak and Others, both cited above). It is particularly sensitive to any appearance that differing, and inconsistent, approaches have been taken in these cases. Nonetheless, it is not persuaded that this is so. The Chamber decisions in the above- mentioned cases are very concise; and in the absence of arguments from the parties, there is no explanatory reasoning. Their conclusion, however, that the applications were introduced out of time is in line with the principles and case-law outlined above. It is not disputed that the applicants ’ relatives disappeared or were killed in 1964, that there was no ongoing process of exhaustion of domestic remedies or other relevant procedures in the following years and that the matter was eventually brought before the CMP in 1989. However, in accordance with the Court ’ s approach above, it must have been apparent by the end of 1990 that this body could not realistically be expected to bring about any positive results in the near future. By waiting therefore until 2001, a further period of eleven years, during which there were no intervening events capable of suspending the running of time, the applicants in those cases had unduly delayed in introducing their complaints before the Court."

The applicant was present during the regrouping of the battalion. Two hours after the regrouping the commander of the battalion led his men out of Trimithi village, reaching a ravine between the villages of Ayios Georghios and Templos where they took up battle positions. A number of commandos of the 33rd Battalion arrived in the same ravine. At around 3 p.m. on 22 July 1974, Turkish military forces surrounded the Cypriot forces in the ravine and opened fire.

S/18102/Add. 1, of 11 June 1986, para. 15); and that, while no difficulties were encountered as regards the organisation of interviews or visits in the field, real difficulties then arose by the lapse of time and, even more importantly, lack of cooperation by the witnesses.",

However, the committee could not compel a witness to talk. The explanation of the witnesses ’ reluctance to testify was that they were afraid of incriminating themselves or others in disappearances, and this despite the witnesses being told by the committee that the information given would be kept strictly confidential and being reassured that they would ‘ not be subject to any form of police or judicial prosecution ’.

It recalled that according to its terms of reference it could not itself order disinterments. Moreover, while there was access to all evidence available, the committee had not reached the stage of finding a common denominator for the appreciation of the value of this evidence. Finally, the committee stated that it was considering the possibility of requesting that the two sides furnish it with basic information concerning the files of all missing persons, so as to allow it to have a global view of the whole problem.",

In December 1990, the UN Secretary-General wrote a letter to the leaders of both sides observing that so far the committee had been given details on only about 15 % of the cases and urging them to submit all cases. He further emphasised the importance of reaching consensus on the criteria that both sides would be ready to apply in their respective investigations. Moreover, the committee should consider modalities for sharing with affected families any meaningful information available (Doc. S/24050, of 31 May 1992, para. 38). On 4 October 1993, in a further letter to the leaders of both communities the UN Secretary-General noted that no improvement had been made and that the international community would not understand that the committee, nine years after it had become operational, remained unable to function effectively. Only 210 cases had been submitted by the Greek Cypriot side and only 318 by the Turkish Cypriot side. He again urged both sides to submit all cases without further delay and the committee to reach a consensus on the criteria for concluding its investigations (Doc. S/26777, of 22 November 1993, paras. 88-90).",
                "190. On 17 May 1995 the UN Secretary-General, on the basis of a report of the CMP ’ s third member and proposals by both sides, put forward compromise proposals on criteria for concluding the investigations (Doc. S/1 995/488, of 15 June 1995, para. 47), which were subsequently accepted by both sides (Doc. S/1995/1020, of 10 December 1995, para. 33). By December 1995, the Greek Cypriot side submitted all their case files (1493). However, the committee ’ s third member withdrew in March 1996 and the UN Secretary-General made it a condition for appointing a new one that certain outstanding questions, including classification of cases, sequence of investigations, priorities and expeditious collection of information on cases without known witnesses, be settled beforehand (Doc. S/1996/411, of 7 June 1996, para. 31). After being repeatedly urged to resolve these issues (Doc. S/1997 /437, of 5 June 1997, paras. 24 -25), both parties eventually came to an agreement on 31 July 1997 on the exchange of information on the location of graves of missing persons and return of their remains. They also requested the appointment of a new third member of the CMP (Doc. S/1997/962, of 4 December 1997, paras. 21 and 29-31). However, by June 1998, no progress had been made towards the implementation of this agreement. The UN Secretary-General noted in this context that the Turkish Cypriot side had claimed that victims of the coup d ’ état against Archbishop Makarios in 1974 were among the persons listed as missing and that this position deviated from the agreement (Doc. S/1998/488, of 10 June 1998, para. 23).",

The case concerned the forced disappearance in 1970 (twenty years before Panama accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court) of Heliodoro Portugal, whose remains were found in 2000. It considered that the victim should be presumed dead before the date of acceptance of the court ’ s jurisdiction (9 May 1990), with regard to the fact that twenty years had elapsed since his disappearance. It characterised the extrajudicial killing as an instantaneous act and accepted the government ’ s preliminary exception as regards the right to life (Article 4).

Given the situation of armed conflict at the time, the absence of any credible evidence that the missing persons had been seen after the end of hostilities and the lapse of time, a presumption of death accorded with the Court ’ s constant case-law, as well as national practice, in which context Cypriot law provided that a person could be declared dead if there had been no news of them for ten years."

Where a person dies after introduction of an application, his or her heirs may seek to continue the application without the name of the application changing. If the alleged victim of a violation has died before the introduction of the application, it may be possible for the person with requisite legal interest as next of kin to introduce an application raising complaints related to the death; however, the application is registered in the relative ’ s own name (see, concerning standing to introduce applications, Fairfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24790/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI ).

Turkey, cited above, § 133, where the evidence was found to bear out the assertion that “many persons now missing” had been detained by the respondent Government or forces for which they were responsible ). That judgment cannot therefore be regarded as determining the issues and claims arising in the present applications. In that regard, it should also be noted that in individual applications the Court has the competence to issue just satisfaction awards for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage suffered by individual applicants and to give indications under Article 46 as to any general or individual measures that might be taken.

They stated that the assertion of a continuing situation was not sufficient or decisive, since the determining question was whether an obligation bound the State at the moment of the facts giving rise to the dispute. Issues of continuing situation or violation only came into play after the establishment of a norm binding the State from that moment and for the future, as shown by the terms of Article 6 of Protocol No. 11 itself. Turkey had only recognised the competence of the Commission to receive individual petitions as from 28 January 1987; this only concerned matters raised in respect of facts which occurred subsequent to the Turkish declaration."

Thus, in the present cases, the respondent Government stressed that the allegations of disappearances rested on facts occurring during the period July to August 1974; none of the purported sightings of the missing men had occurred after October 1974. The respondent Government, however, had only recognised the right of individual petition on 28 January 1987 as concerned complaints about facts arising after that date. Thus, the Court had no temporal jurisdiction over the events in issue. While the Chamber judgment purported to apply the approach of the fourth inter-State case to this issue, the respondent Government pointed out that temporal jurisdiction was not in issue in that case, the Chamber confusing this aspect with issues on the merits concerning the existence of a continuing situation. Further, neither Blečić nor the Turkish declaration made any exception concerning continuing situations. They noted that the Blečić judgment referred to Moldovan and Others and Rostaş and Others v. Romania ( (dec.), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, 13 March 2001 ) which found, as regarded complaints under Article 2 about ineffective investigations into killings, that there was no temporal jurisdiction where the killings had taken place before ratification. This showed that the consequences flowing from the initial facts could not be examined either, excluding so-called continuing situations, as shown by subsequent cases such as Kholodovy v. Russia ( (dec.), no. 30651/05, 14 September 2006) in which the Court had found that the subsequent failure of remedies aimed at redressing an earlier interference could not bring the matter within temporal jurisdiction ( the respondent Government also cited Dinchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 23057/03, 6 March 2007; Meriakri v. Moldova (dec.), no. 53487/99, 16 January 2001; Mrkić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 7118/03, 8 June 2006; and Cakir v. Cyprus (dec. ), no. 7864/06, 11 January 2008, where complaints about a killing in 1974 were rejected due to a temporal bar ). The Chamber should therefore not only have refrained from examining the facts in 1974 but also the procedures and facts which flowed from or were linked with those facts. Its contrary approach was inconsistent with constant practice. Rejecting the preliminary objection on the basis of a finding of the existence of a continuing obligation effectively prejudged the merits."

The respondent Government further argued that the procedural obligation to investigate under Articles 2 and 3 was recent and could not be regarded as binding the States retrospectively.

Indeed, the procedural obligation to provide some form of effective official investigation arises when individuals have gone missing in life-threatening circumstances and is not confined to cases where it is apparent that the disappearance was caused by an agent of the State (see Osmanoğlu v.

The Grand Chamber judgment set out in detail international law materials, in particular from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (“the IACHR”) and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (“the HRC”), which indicated that these bodies accepted jurisdiction ratione temporis over the procedural complaints concerning investigations into deaths even where the lethal acts had taken place before the critical date ( ibid., §§ 111-18 and 160 ).

The Court would note that the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2 where there has been an unlawful or suspicious death is triggered by, in most cases, the discovery of the body or the occurrence of death. Where disappearances in life-threatening circumstances are concerned, the procedural obligation to investigate can hardly come to an end on discovery of the body or the presumption of death; this merely casts light on one aspect of the fate of the missing person. An obligation to account for the disappearance and death, and to identify and prosecute any perpetrator of unlawful acts in that connection, will generally remain."

                "148. There is, however, an important distinction to be drawn in the Court ’ s case-law between the obligation to investigate a suspicious death and the obligation to investigate a suspicious disappearance. A disappearance is a distinct phenomenon, characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability in which there is a lack of information or even a deliberate concealment and obfuscation of what has occurred (see also the definitions of disappearance set out above in part II B. “ International law documents on enforced disappearances ” ). This situation is very often drawn out over time, prolonging the torment of the victim ’ s relatives. It cannot therefore be said that a disappearance is, simply, an “instantaneous” act or event; the additional distinctive element of subsequent failure to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing person gives rise to a continuing situation. Thus, the procedural obligation will, potentially, persist as long as the fate of the person is unaccounted for; the ongoing failure to provide the requisite investigation will be regarded as a continuing violation (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 136). This is so, even where death may, eventually, be presumed."

In the former, the Court had found that the lapse of time between the facts and the introduction of the applications by Turkish Cypriot applicants was too long, without mention of any apparent continuing violation. On that basis, the present applications should also have been rejected as out of time. The fact that the applications were introduced three years after ratification in this particular case, while thirteen years had elapsed in the cases against Cyprus, had no logical bearing on the different approaches applied in regard to the six - month rule.

Nor can Article 35 § 1 be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seise the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six- month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

In the fourth inter-State case, where it was implicit that a similar approach was applicable to a continuing practice – and in that case it was a continuous failure to comply with the obligation to investigate disappearances – the Court notes that the issue of the six- month rule had been joined to the merits by the Commission and neither Government had since made any submissions on the point ( see Cyprus v.

The Court cannot emphasise enough that the Convention is a system for the protection of human rights and that it is of crucial importance that it is interpreted and applied in a manner that renders these rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. This concerns not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the Convention, but also procedural provisions; it impacts on the obligations imposed on respondent Governments, but also has effects on the position of applicants. For example, while it is essential for the efficacy of the system that Contracting States comply with their obligation not to hinder the applicant in the exercise of the right of individual petition, individuals nonetheless bear the responsibility of cooperating with procedures flowing from the introduction of their complaints, assisting in clarifying any factual issues where such lie within their knowledge and in maintaining and supporting the applications introduced on their behalf (see Kapan v. Turkey, no. 22057/93, Commission decision of 13 January 1997, DR 88- A, p. 17 ).

Not all continuing situations are the same; the nature of the situation may be such that the passage of time affects what is at stake. In cases of disappearances, just as it is imperative that the relevant domestic authorities launch an investigation and take measures as soon as a person has disappeared in life-threatening circumstances, it is indispensable that the applicants, who are the relatives of missing persons, do not delay unduly in bringing a complaint about the ineffectiveness or lack of such investigation before the Court. With the lapse of time, memories of witnesses fade, witnesses may die or become untraceable, evidence deteriorates or ceases to exist, and the prospects that any effective investigation can be undertaken will increasingly diminish; and the Court ’ s own examination and judgment may be deprived of meaningfulness and effectiveness. Accordingly, where disappearances are concerned, applicants cannot wait indefinitely before coming to Strasbourg. They must make proof of a certain amount of diligence and initiative and introduce their complaints without undue delay. What this involves is examined below.",

In those cases, there is generally a precise point in time at which death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain. The lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent. Accordingly, the requirements of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case before Strasbourg within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after events. In disappearance cases, where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear cut. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance."

The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance stipulates that any time-limit on the prosecution of disappearance offences should be of long duration proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, while the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court excludes any statute of limitations as regards the prosecution of international crimes against humanity, which includes enforced disappearances. Bearing in mind therefore the consensus that it should be possible to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes even many years after the events, the Court considers that the serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection."

Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case."

If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated. Where more than ten years have elapsed, the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg.

Throughout the 1980 s, there were ongoing procedures on these issues. However, only the fourth inter-State case, lodged much later in 199 4, was able to be brought before this Court, after Turkey accepted the Court ’ s jurisdiction; the previous three applications which were before the Commission ended in reports which went to the Committee of Ministers, none of which were made available publicly before 1992, many years after their adoption (see Cyprus v.

However, information about the progress of the CMP ’ s work was limited due to the strict confidentiality of its procedure. It is apparent that actual work on cases started in 1984 and concrete investigative steps were being taken in the following years. In April 1990 the CMP issued a lengthy press release highlighting fundamental difficulties with hearing witnesses, locating bodies and obtaining disinterments.

It is particularly sensitive to any appearance that differing, and inconsistent, approaches have been taken in these cases. Nonetheless, it is not persuaded that this is so. The Chamber decisions in the above- mentioned cases are very concise; and in the absence of arguments from the parties, there is no explanatory reasoning. Their conclusion, however, that the applications were introduced out of time is in line with the principles and case-law outlined above. It is not disputed that the applicants ’ relatives disappeared or were killed in 1964, that there was no ongoing process of exhaustion of domestic remedies or other relevant procedures in the following years and that the matter was eventually brought before the CMP in 1989.

Against this background, the Court observes that the evidence bears out the applicant Government ’ s claim that many persons now missing were detained either by Turkish or Turkish Cypriot forces. Their detention occurred at a time when the conduct of military operations was accompanied by arrests and killings on a large scale. The Commission correctly described the situation as life-threatening. The above-mentioned broadcast statement of Mr Denktaş and the later report of Professor Küçük, if not conclusive of the respondent State ’ s liability for the death of missing persons are, at the very least, clear indications of the climate of risk and fear obtaining at the material time and of the real dangers to which detainees were exposed. ”"

The Court notes that the procedural obligation was stated as arising where individuals, last seen in the custody of agents of the State, subsequently disappeared in a life-threatening context. In the context of the inter-State case it was not necessary to specify which individuals were included in the “many persons” shown by the evidence to have been detained by Turkish or Turkish Cypriot forces at the time of their disappearance. There is no basis on which it can be assumed that the missing men in the present case were included in the Court ’ s findings. It must therefore be determined in this case whether the conditions for a procedural obligation arose."

In response to the respondent Government ’ s argument about the burden of proof, the Court would concur that the standard of proof generally applicable in individual applications is that of beyond reasonable doubt – though this also applies equally in inter-State cases (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161, Series A no. 25 ). The burden of proof may be easier to satisfy in practical terms in the inter-State context where the facts of many incidents and numerous events may be taken into account. But, even in individual cases, the Court ’ s case-law has identified situations in which the rigour of this rule may be mitigated."

Thus, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, death or disappearances occurring during such detention. The burden of proof may then be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21896/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII, and Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no. 23954/94, § § 85-89, 31 May 200 1 ); see also cases short of custody, where it is possible to establish that an individual entered a place under those authorities ’ control and has not been seen since, in which circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty ( see, for example, Taniş and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, § 160, ECHR 2005 - VIII, and Yusupova and Zaurbekov v. Russia, no. 22057/02, § § 50- 5 5, 9 October 2008 )."

If they then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn ( see Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, § 211, ECHR 2005-II; and, among many cases concerning the situation in Chechnya, Goygova v. Russia, no. 74240/01, §§ 88-96, 4 October 2007, and Magomed Musayev and Others v.

Nor is it for the Court to seek to establish what occurred in 1974, which is outside its temporal jurisdiction. However, it is satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case that two men were last seen in circumstances falling within the control of the Turkish or Turkish Cypriots forces, namely, Eleftherios Thoma and Savvas Hadjipanteli who were included on an ICRC list as detainees (see paragraphs 77 and 80 above). As concerns the other seven men, no such documentary evidence of actual detention has been forthcoming. There is nonetheless an arguable case that the other seven men were last seen in an area under, or about to come under, the control of the Turkish armed forces. Whether they died, in the fighting or of their wounds, or whether they were captured as prisoners, they must still be accounted for. Article 2 must be interpreted in so far as possible in light of the general principles of international law, including the rules of international humanitarian law which play an indispensable and universally accepted role in mitigating the savagery and inhumanity of armed conflict [17] (see Loizidou, cited above, § 43 ). The Court therefore concurs with the reasoning of the Chamber in holding that in a zone of international conflict Contracting States are under obligation to protect the lives of those not, or no longer, engaged in hostilities. This would also extend to the provision of medical assistance to the wounded; where combatants have died, or succumbed to wounds, the need for accountability would necessitate proper disposal of remains and require the authorities to collect and provide information about the identity and fate of those concerned, or permit bodies such as the ICRC to do so."

Nor is there any other convincing explanation as to what might have happened to them that might counter the applicants ’ claims that the men disappeared in areas under the respondent Government ’ s exclusive control. In the light of the findings in the fourth inter-State case, which have not been controverted, these disappearances occurred in life-threatening circumstances where the conduct of military operations was accompanied by widespread arrests and killings. Article 2 therefore imposes a continuing obligation on the respondent Government to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing men in the present case; if warranted, consequent measures for redress could then be effectively adopted.",

The Court cannot but note that the authorities of the respondent State have never undertaken any investigation into the claims made by the relatives of the missing persons that the latter had disappeared after being detained in circumstances in which there was real cause to fear for their welfare. It must be noted in this connection that there was no official follow-up to Mr Denktaş ’ s alarming statement. No attempt was made to identify the names of the persons who were reportedly released from Turkish custody into the hands of Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries or to inquire into the whereabouts of the places where the bodies were disposed of. It does not appear either that any official inquiry was made into the claim that Greek Cypriot prisoners were transferred to Turkey.",

Nor have any investigative measures been taken to locate or question any witnesses in the area who could give information as to how Savvas Hadjipanteli and the others found with him in the mass grave came to meet their end and at whose hands.

The Court does not doubt that many years after the events there would be considerable difficulty in assembling eyewitness evidence or in identifying and mounting a case against any alleged perpetrators. However, the Court ’ s case-law on the ambit of the procedural obligation is unambiguous. The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. Even where there may be obstacles which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, § § 111 and 114, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, § 65, 27 November 2007 ). Besides being independent, accessible to the victim ’ s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition and affording a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the death was caused unlawfully and if so, to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( see Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, § 88, ECHR 1999 ‑ III; Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001; and Douglas-Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56413/00, 8 January 2002)."

Nor is any other body or authority taking on that role. It may be that investigations would prove inconclusive, or insufficient evidence would be available. However, that outcome is not inevitable even at this late stage and the respondent Government cannot be absolved from making the requisite efforts. By way of example, the Court notes that in the context of Northern Ireland the authorities have provided for investigative bodies ( variously, the Serious Crimes Review Team and Historical Enquiry Team ) to review the files on past sectarian murders and unsolved killings and to assess the availability of any new evidence and the feasibility of further investigative measures; in cases before the Court, these measures were found, given the time that had elapsed, to have been adequate in the particular circumstances ( see Brecknell, cited above, §§ 71, 75 and 79-81).

The finding of such a violation is not limited to cases where the respondent State has been held responsible for the disappearance ( see Osmanoğlu, cited above, § 96 ) but can arise where the failure of the authorities to respond to the quest for information by the relatives or the obstacles placed in their way, leaving them to bear the brunt of the efforts to uncover any facts, may be regarded as disclosing a flagrant, continuous and callous disregard of an obligation to account for the whereabouts and fate of a missing person."

They also submitted that there had been substantial progress in the activities of the CMP and that as the issue of disappearances concerned both communities, awards to Greek Cypriot families would deepen the wounds of Turkish Cypriot families with missing relatives and not help in the process of conciliation.

Reparation should be made available in the form of compensation. In not awarding such damages, the Chamber had departed from constant practice in disappearance cases. The fourth inter-State case was not relevant as it was not known if compensation could, or would, be awarded.

In disappearance cases, the goal was restitutio in integrum and, where that was not possible, compensation and other adequate and appropriate forms of reparation were considered. Compensation should be proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of the case. They also submitted that, in line with this Court ’ s case-law, an effective remedy required an effective investigation into the matter, while the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provided that measures be taken to enable victims to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the disappearance. In disappearance cases, the Inter ‑ American Court of Human Rights had ordered the exhumation and return of the body, as well as damages for moral suffering, an investigation into the circumstances and publication of the facts of the case. The right to know the truth was also recognised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee. A number of treaty texts and judgments referred to the need for special steps to end ongoing and continuing violations and to guarantee against non-recurrence."

Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 448, 18 June 2002 ). It considers there to be little, if any, scope under the Convention for directing governments to pay penalties to applicants which are unconnected with damage shown to be actually incurred in respect of past violations of the Convention; in so far as such sums would purport to compensate for future suffering of the applicants, this would be speculative in the extreme.",

Evolving case by case, the Court ’ s approach in awarding just satisfaction has distinguished situations where the applicant has suffered evident trauma, whether physical or psychological, pain and suffering, distress, anxiety, frustration, feelings of injustice or humiliation, prolonged uncertainty, disruption to life, or real loss of opportunity ( see, for example, Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, § 70, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 123, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 12, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX ) and those situations where the public vindication of the wrong suffered by the applicant, in a judgment binding on the Contracting State, is a powerful form of redress in itself. In many cases where a law, procedure or practice has been found to fall short of Convention standards this is enough to put matters right (see, for example, Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI; Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 188, ECHR 2008; and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 134, ECHR 2008 ). In some situations, however, the impact of the violation may be regarded as being of a nature and degree as to have impinged so significantly on the moral well-being of the applicant as to require something further. Such elements do not lend themselves to a process of calculation or precise quantification. Nor is it the Court ’ s role to function akin to a domestic tort mechanism court in apportioning fault and compensatory damages between civil parties. Its guiding principle is equity, which above all involves flexibility and an objective consideration of what is just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, including not only the position of the applicant but the overall context in which the breach occurred. Its non-pecuniary awards serve to give recognition to the fact that moral damage occurred as a result of a breach of a fundamental human right and reflect in the broadest of terms the severity of the damage; they are not, nor should they be, intended to give financial comfort or sympathetic enrichment at the expense of the Contracting Party concerned."

It is therefore not the case that there are specific scales of damages that should be awarded in disappearance cases as the applicants have sought to deduce from the past cases involving disappearances in Russia and Turkey. Neither can the Court agree that the Chamber erred in taking into account the background of the case and the ongoing executions process before the Committee of Ministers. As the applicants ’ own submissions make plain, their principal concern is for the uncertainty to be brought to an end by the provision of information about what happened to their relatives so long ago. That said, the applicants have endured decades of not knowing, which must have marked them profoundly. Given the grievous nature of the case and making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the sum of EUR 1 2 ,000 for non-pecuniary damage to each of the nine applicants, to be held by the heirs where the applicant has deceased."

                "“The legal ban on the destruction of embryos is to be understood as prohibiting the interruption of cryopreservation other than in two cases: where the thawed embryo can be implanted in the uterus of the mother or another woman willing to have it implanted; or where natural death or permanent loss of viability as an organism can be medically certified. In the light of current [scientific] knowledge, the viability of an embryo cannot be certified unless it has been thawed, thus creating the paradoxical situation in which, once thawed, an embryo cannot be frozen a second time and if it is not immediately implanted into the uterus death will inevitably ensue. Hence, a tutiorist prospect of frozen embryos being stored for an indeterminate period. However, it can be assumed that advances in scientific research will make it possible to determine the criteria and methods for diagnosing death, or in any event loss of viability, of cryopreserved embryos. It will thus be possible to overcome the present – and legally inevitable – paradox of potentially indefinite cryopreservation. Pending those results, [it should be reaffirmed that] the explicit ban under section 14 of Law no. 40 of 2004 on the destruction of embryos, including therefore frozen embryos, cannot be ignored. That is not all, for as regards the fate of surplus embryos, the authors of Law no. 40 opted for their storage and not their destruction, thus establishing as a principle that they should be kept alive even where their fate is uncertain.”",

As the constitutional principle in issue imposes a duty on the legislature to comply with those provisions, any national provision incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus with the ‘international law obligations’ referred to in Article 117 § 1 would ipso facto violate this constitutional principle. Article 117 § 1 ultimately creates a reference to Convention provisions which may be relevant in a particular case, giving life [ dà vita ] and substantive content to the international law obligations evoked generally and to the [underlying constitutional] principle, such as to be generally classified as ‘interposed provisions’, and which in turn are reviewed in terms of their compatibility with the Constitution, as will be discussed below.",

The latter have created a system for the uniform protection of fundamental rights. The application and interpretation of that system is naturally in the first instance a matter for the courts of the member States, which are the ordinary courts in relation to Convention law. Definitive uniformity in application is on the other hand guaranteed by the centralised interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – a task assigned to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which has the last word and the jurisdiction of which ‘shall extend to all matters concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention and the Protocols thereto which are referred to it as provided [therein]’ (Article 32 § 1 of the Convention). ...",

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ II; Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ I; and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 129, ECHR 2004 ‑ V)."

There were about 50-60 demonstrators and 5-6 police officers, wearing camouflage clothing and balaclavas. As we were locking up the workshop, I saw that masked policemen, with one knee on the ground ( yere diz çökerek ), were firing guns unremittingly towards the demonstrators. Tarık Ataykaya was with us. He did not take part in the demonstrations. After leaving the workshop Tarık Ataykaya went back there because the demonstrators were heading towards us.

The use of force, however, must be no more than is “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) ( see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 148, Series A no. 324, and Solomou and Others v.

In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub-paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2. Furthermore, in keeping with the importance of this provision in a democratic society, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of the agents of the State who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination ( see Giuliani and Gaggio v.

First of all, it is not disputed that the applicant ’ s son, Tarık Ataykaya, was killed on 29 March 2006 by a tear-gas grenade fired by the security forces. Nor is it disputed that he was part of a group of violent demonstrators and found himself by chance between the demonstrators and the police. The Court would further observe that Tarık Ataykaya was killed by a member of the security forces who was masked at the time of the incident. It has thus been established “beyond any reasonable doubt” that a member of the security forces fired a tear-gas grenade towards Tarık Ataykaya, injuring him in the head and causing his death. It follows that the burden of proof is on the authorities, which have a duty to show that the use of lethal force in question was made absolutely necessary by the situation and that it was not excessive or unjustified within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of the Convention ( see Bektaş and Özalp v. Turkey, no. 10036/03, § 57, 20 April 2010). Against this background, the Court must examine in the present case not only whether the use of potentially lethal force against the applicant ’ s son was legitimate but also whether the operation was regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk to his life ( see Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, § 60, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). It must also verify that the authorities did not act negligently in their choice of measures ( see Nachova and Others v.

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them ( see, among many other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B, and Klaas v.

Initially, in a letter of June 2006, the Diyarbakır police headquarters informed the public prosecutor ’ s office that three police officers had used the weapons in question ( see paragraph 14 above ). Subsequently, in a letter of 10 April 2007, the public prosecutor ’ s office was informed that twelve other members of the special forces and eleven other members of the rapid intervention force, making a total of twenty-three police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch, had also been authorised to use such weapons at the time of the incident ( see paragraph 18 above ). However, there is no evidence in the case file that the identities of all these officers were notified to the appropriate public prosecutor ’ s office, which confined itself, moreover, to interviewing only a few of the police officers ( see paragraphs 20 and 26 above ). Similarly, according to the information in the file, as regards the public prosecutor ’ s request concerning the places where the officers were stationed, the reply of the police authorities was imprecise, providing vague information and simply indicating that the officers had been posted to different areas at the time of the incident (see paragraph 17 above ).

In this connection it would refer to its previous finding, under Article 3 of the Convention, to the effect that any inability to determine the identity of members of the security forces, when they are alleged to have committed acts that are incompatible with the Convention, breaches that provision ( see, mutatis mutandis, Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no. 50222/99, §§ 59 and 60, 30 September 2004, and Rashid v. Bulgaria, no. 47905/99, §§ 63 - 65, 18 January 2007). Similarly, the Court has already stated that where the competent national authorities deploy masked police officers to maintain law and order or to make an arrest, those officers should be required to visibly display some distinctive insignia – for example a warrant number – thus, while ensuring their anonymity, enabling their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted ( see Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, § 92, 11 October 2011, and Özalp Ulusoy v. Turkey, no. 9049/06, § 54, 4 June 2013 ). Those considerations are all the more valid in the present case as it concerns a death following a shot fired by a member of the security forces who was wearing a balaclava."

                "54. The Court thus finds that the domestic authorities deliberately created a situation of impunity which made it impossible to identify members of the security forces who were suspected of inappropriately firing tear-gas grenades and to establish the responsibilities of the senior officers, thus preventing any effective investigation ( see, mutatis mutandis, Dedovski and Others v. Russia, no. 7178/03, § 91, ECHR 2008 ). In addition, it is troubling that no information on the incident which caused Tarık Ataykaya ’ s death was mentioned in the records of the security forces ( see paragraph 29 above )."

            [
                "55. The Court further observes that in the first year following the incident practically no progress was made in the investigation. The public prosecutor admittedly attempted on a number of occasions to identify the members of the security forces who had had recourse to tear-gas grenades (paragraph 13 above ). Those attempts were not, however, followed up, or they were only partly successful and after an unacceptable delay. Moreover, the public prosecutor ’ s officer proceeded only belatedly to hear evidence from the complainant, from a few police officers whose identities had been disclosed and from eyewitnesses. For example, B.A., one of the police officers who had used tear-gas grenades, was not interviewed until 14 February 2007 – more than ten months after the incident ( see paragraph 20 above ). Two other police officers were not interviewed until about two years after the event ( see paragraph 26 above ). In this connection, the Court would reiterate its findings in Bektaş and Özalp ( cited above, § 65 – police officers questioned seven days after the incident), and in Ramsahai and Others ([GC], no. 52391/99, § 330, ECHR 2007-II – police officers questioned three days after the incident), to the effect that such delays not only create an appearance of collusion between the investigative authorities and the police, they could also lead the victim ’ s family – and the public in general – to believe that the members of the security forces are not accountable for their acts to the judicial authorities. In the present case, although there is no evidence that they colluded with each other or with their colleagues in the Mardin police force, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation ( see Ramsahai and Others, cited above, § 330)."

            [
                "56. Furthermore, the Court observes that, notwithstanding the applicant ’ s request (see paragraph 11 above ), no expert opinion was ordered to establish how the grenade had been fired, especially as, in view of its impact and the injuries caused, it seems that the shot, as stated by an eyewitness ( see paragraph 9 above ), had been direct, following a flat trajectory, rather than a high-angle shot. The Court has already had occasion to observe that “firing a tear-gas grenade along a direct, flat trajectory by means of a launcher cannot be regarded as an appropriate police action as it could potentially cause serious, or indeed fatal injuries, whereas a high-angle shot would generally constitute the appropriate approach, since it prevents people from being injured or killed in the event of an impact ” ( see Abdullah Yaşa and Others, cited above, § 48)."

            [
                "57. As regards, lastly, the regulatory framework for the use of non-lethal weapons, such as tear-gas grenades, the Court would point out that, in the case of Abdullah Yaşa and Others ( cited above ), which concerned an injury caused by the firing of a tear-gas grenade during the same incidents as those which gave rise to the present case, it examined the regulations on the use of tear-gas grenades. It found that at the relevant time Turkish law contained no specific provisions regulating the use of such equipment during demonstrations or any instructions in that connection. Given that during the events in Diyarbakır between 28 and 31 March 2006 two individuals, one of whom was Tarık Ataykaya, were killed by tear-gas grenades, it may be concluded that the police officers were able to act with considerable autonomy and take ill-considered initiatives, as would probably not have been the case if they had been given appropriate training and instructions. In the Court ’ s view, such a situation is not sufficient to provide the level of protection “by law” of the right to life that is required in present-day democratic societies in Europe ( see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, § 62, and Abdullah Yaşa and Others, cited above, § 49 )."

The same is true for the preparation and supervision of the operation; the Government have not adduced any evidence to suggest that the security forces deployed the requisite vigilance to ensure that any risk to life was reduced to a minimum. In addition, the Court takes the view that, as far as their positive obligation under the first sentence of Article 2 § 1 to put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework was concerned, the Turkish authorities had not done all that could be reasonably expected of them, first, to afford to citizens the requisite level of protection, particularly where – as in the present case – potentially lethal force was to be used, and, secondly, to avoid any real and immediate risk to life which might arise in the context of police operations dealing with violent demonstrations ( see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, § 71)."

If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate.

Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 137, ECHR 2013; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 47, ECHR 2004 ‑ I; Assanidzé v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 198, ECHR 2004 ‑ II; and Ilaşcu and Others v.

                "“ 156. The object of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is to promote legal certainty, by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge. It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see, among other authorities, Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I).",
                "157. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Nor can Article 35 § 1 be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to [apprise] the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001).",
                "162. The Court would comment, firstly, that a distinction must be drawn with cases of unlawful or violent death. In those cases, there is generally a precise point in time at which death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain. The lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent. Accordingly, the requirements of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case before Strasbourg within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after events. In disappearance cases, where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear cut. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance.",
                "163. Secondly, the Court would take cognisance of the international materials on enforced disappearances. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance stipulates that any time-limit on the prosecution of disappearance offences should be of long duration proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, while the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court excludes any statute of limitations as regards the prosecution of international crimes against humanity, which includes enforced disappearances. Bearing in mind therefore the consensus that it should be possible to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes even many years after the events, the Court considers that the serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection.",
                "164. Thirdly, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is best for the facts of cases to be investigated and issues to be resolved in so far as possible at the domestic level. It is in the interests of the applicant, and the efficacy of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention.",
                "165. Nonetheless, the Court considers that applications can be rejected as out of time in disappearance cases where there has been excessive or unexplained delay on the part of applicants once they have, or should have, become aware that no investigation has been instigated or that the investigation has lapsed into inaction or become ineffective and, in any of those eventualities, there is no immediate, realistic prospect of an effective investigation being provided in the future. Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case.",
                "166. In a complex disappearance situation such as the present, arising in a situation of international conflict, where it is alleged that there is a complete absence of any investigation or meaningful contact with the authorities, it may be expected that the relatives bring the case within, at most, several years of the incident. If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated. Where more than ten years have elapsed, the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg. Stricter expectations would apply in cases where the applicants have direct domestic access to the investigative authorities. ”",

            ],
            [
                "54. General principles concerning the six-month time-limit in cases of disappearances of individuals are set out in the case of Varnava as follows (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 et al., §§ 156-57 and 162-66, ECHR 2009) :",
                "“ 156. The object of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is to promote legal certainty, by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge. It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see, among other authorities, Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I).",
                "157. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Nor can Article 35 § 1 be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to [apprise] the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001).",
                "162. The Court would comment, firstly, that a distinction must be drawn with cases of unlawful or violent death. In those cases, there is generally a precise point in time at which death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain. The lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent. Accordingly, the requirements of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case before Strasbourg within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after events. In disappearance cases, where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear cut. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance.",
                "163. Secondly, the Court would take cognisance of the international materials on enforced disappearances. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance stipulates that any time-limit on the prosecution of disappearance offences should be of long duration proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, while the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court excludes any statute of limitations as regards the prosecution of international crimes against humanity, which includes enforced disappearances. Bearing in mind therefore the consensus that it should be possible to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes even many years after the events, the Court considers that the serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection.",
                "164. Thirdly, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is best for the facts of cases to be investigated and issues to be resolved in so far as possible at the domestic level. It is in the interests of the applicant, and the efficacy of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention.",
                "165. Nonetheless, the Court considers that applications can be rejected as out of time in disappearance cases where there has been excessive or unexplained delay on the part of applicants once they have, or should have, become aware that no investigation has been instigated or that the investigation has lapsed into inaction or become ineffective and, in any of those eventualities, there is no immediate, realistic prospect of an effective investigation being provided in the future. Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case.",
                "166. In a complex disappearance situation such as the present, arising in a situation of international conflict, where it is alleged that there is a complete absence of any investigation or meaningful contact with the authorities, it may be expected that the relatives bring the case within, at most, several years of the incident. If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated. Where more than ten years have elapsed, the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg. Stricter expectations would apply in cases where the applicants have direct domestic access to the investigative authorities. ”",

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death. Moreover, where there has been a use of force by State agents, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard ( ibid., § 233 and Nachova and Others v.

Nevertheless, the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation ’ s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case. The nature and degree of scrutiny must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work. Where a suspicious death has been inflicted at the hands of a State agent, particularly stringent scrutiny must be applied by the relevant domestic authorities to the ensuing investigation ( ibid., § 234)."

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, § 237).

In the situation where the names of potential perpetrators have been revealed to the authorities by witnesses whose reliability has not been called into question and where some of them were direct eyewitnesses, it should be expected of the prosecuting authorities that they take appropriate steps in order to bring those responsible to justice.

Failure by the authorities to pursue the prosecution of the most probable direct perpetrators undermines the effectiveness of the criminal ‑ law mechanism aimed at prevention, suppression and punishment of unlawful killings. Compliance with the State ’ s procedural obligations under Article 2 requires the domestic legal system to demonstrate its capacity and willingness to enforce criminal law against those who have unlawfully taken the life of another (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 160; and Ghimp and Others v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 32520/09, § 43, 30 October 2012). ”"

It added that the Statute barred priests from taking part in proceedings in the civil courts, even in connection with personal disputes, without the archbishop ’ s prior written permission. Pointing out that priests chaired parish assemblies and governing bodies, the Archdiocese submitted that they were thus unable to form trade unions since the Trade Unions Act prohibited anyone performing management functions from doing so.

                "The court further observes that the Statute of the Church, as approved by Government Ordinance no. 53/2008, does not expressly forbid the establishment of a trade union for clergy and lay staff in accordance with labour legislation. The third party, which contends that the right to form a trade union is subject to receiving the archbishop ’ s blessing, has not disputed that the union ’ s founding members are contractual employees.",
                "The third party ’ s arguments have been analysed in the light of both sections 7 to 10 of the Religious Freedom Act, which acknowledges the important role of the Romanian Orthodox Church and its organisational and operational autonomy, and section 1(2) of the same Act, which provides that ‘ no one shall be prevented from or coerced into embracing a religious opinion or faith contrary to his or her beliefs ’ and that ‘ no one shall suffer discrimination or persecution or be placed in an inferior position on account of his or her faith, membership or non-membership of a religious denomination, group or association, or for exercising freedom of religion in accordance with the law ’.",

                "In the court ’ s opinion, the principle of hierarchical subordination and obedience set forth in the Statute cannot be used as a basis for restricting the right to form a trade union; the only permissible restrictions in this sphere must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.",
                "The third party ’ s argument that the applicants did not obtain the archbishop ’ s permission to take part in proceedings in the civil courts must likewise be dismissed, given that Article 21 of the Constitution provides: ‘ Everyone shall be entitled to apply to the courts for protection of his rights, freedoms or legitimate interests. The exercise of this right shall not be restricted by any statute. ’",
                "The establishment of a trade union does not necessarily indicate the existence of a dissident strand within the Romanian Orthodox Church with a disregard for hierarchy and the rules imposed by the Church; on the contrary, it is likely to contribute to employer-employee dialogue on such matters as negotiation of employment contracts, observance of working and non-working hours and the rules on remuneration, protection of health and safety at work, vocational training, medical cover and the opportunity to elect representatives and stand for election to decision-making bodies, with due regard for the special characteristics of the Church and its religious, spiritual, cultural, educational, social and charitable purpose.",

In a minority of States, [2] the relationship is governed by the applicable labour law, although members of the clergy are required to observe a heightened duty of loyalty towards the religious community that employs them.

Under the bishop ’ s leadership and supervision, they carry out the tasks assigned to them; besides performing liturgical rites and maintaining contact with parishioners, these tasks include teaching and the management of parish assets; members of the clergy are also responsible for the sale of liturgical items (see paragraph 44 above ). In addition, domestic law provides for a specific number of posts for members of the clergy and laity which are largely funded from the State and local authority budgets, the post-holders ’ wages being set with reference to the salaries of Ministry of Education employees ( see paragraphs 30 et seq. above ). The Romanian Orthodox Church pays employer ’ s contributions on the wages paid to its clergy, and priests pay income tax, contribute to the national social security scheme and are entitled to all the welfare benefits available to ordinary employees, such as health insurance, a pension on reaching the statutory retirement age, or unemployment insurance."

Accordingly, members of the clergy assume obligations of a special nature in that they are bound by a heightened duty of loyalty, itself based on a personal, and in principle irrevocable, undertaking by each clergyman.

In this connection, it must be pointed out that the County Court, sitting as the court of final instance, confined itself to a general observation that under the Trade Unions Act, internal regulations could not contain any provisions that were in breach of the Constitution or other laws. Unlike the Court of First Instance, it did not examine the specific issue of whether the prohibition on forming a trade union without the archbishop ’ s permission was compatible with the provisions of the Constitution. However, the Court considers that since the County Court relied on the Church ’ s Statute in its judgment, it implicitly took the view that the provisions of the Statute were not unconstitutional."

In the Court ’ s opinion, it is the domestic courts ’ task to ensure that both freedom of association and the autonomy of religious communities can be observed within such communities in accordance with the applicable law, including the Convention. Where interferences with the right to freedom of association are concerned, it follows from Article 9 of the Convention that religious communities are entitled to their own opinion on any collective activities of their members that might undermine their autonomy and that this opinion must in principle be respected by the national authorities. However, a mere allegation by a religious community that there is an actual or potential threat to its autonomy is not sufficient to render any interference with its members ’ trade-union rights compatible with the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention. It must also show, in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, that the risk alleged is real and substantial and that the impugned interference with freedom of association does not go beyond what is necessary to eliminate that risk and does not serve any other purpose unrelated to the exercise of the religious community ’ s autonomy. The national courts must ensure that these conditions are satisfied, by conducting an in-depth examination of the circumstances of the case and a thorough balancing exercise between the competing interests at stake ( see, mutatis mutandis, Schüth v. Germany, no. 1620/03, § 67, ECHR 2010, and Siebenhaar v. Germany, no. 18136/02, § 45, 3 February 2011)."

In the proceedings before the courts with jurisdiction to examine the union ’ s application for registration, the Archdiocese, which was opposed to its recognition, maintained that the aims set out in the union ’ s constitution were incompatible with the duties accepted by priests by virtue of their ministry and their undertaking towards the archbishop. It asserted that the emergence within the structure of the Church of a new body of this kind would seriously imperil the freedom of religious denominations to organise themselves in accordance with their own traditions, and that the establishment of the trade union would therefore be likely to undermine the Church ’ s traditional hierarchical structure; for these reasons, it argued that it was necessary to limit the trade-union freedom claimed by the applicant union."

In this connection, the Court observes that in Romania, all religious denominations are entitled to adopt their own internal regulations and are thus free to make their own decisions concerning their operations, recruitment of staff and relations with their clergy ( see paragraph 29 above ). The principle of the autonomy of religious communities is the cornerstone of relations between the Romanian State and the religious communities recognised within its territory, including the Romanian Orthodox Church. As the Government indicated, members of the Romanian Orthodox clergy, and hence the priests belonging to the applicant union, perform their duties by virtue of their ministry, their undertaking towards the bishop and the decision issued by the latter; the Romanian Orthodox Church has chosen not to incorporate into its Statute the labour- law provisions which are relevant in this regard, a choice that has been approved by a government ordinance in accordance with the principle of the autonomy of religious communities."

It can only confirm this position in the present case. Respect for the autonomy of religious communities recognised by the State implies, in particular, that the State should accept the right of such communities to react, in accordance with their own rules and interests, to any dissident movements emerging within them that might pose a threat to their cohesion, image or unity. It is therefore not the task of the national authorities to act as the arbiter between religious communities and the various dissident factions that exist or may emerge within them."

Having regard to all the information in its possession, the Court shares the Government ’ s view that in refusing to register the applicant union, the State was simply declining to become involved in the organisation and operation of the Romanian Orthodox Church, thereby observing its duty of neutrality under Article 9 of the Convention. It remains to be determined whether the examination carried out by the County Court in refusing the union ’ s application satisfied the conditions for ensuring that the refusal of its registration was necessary in a democratic society (see paragraph 159 above)."

It considers that by taking this approach, the County Court was simply applying the principle of the autonomy of religious communities; its refusal of the applicant union ’ s registration for failure to comply with the requirement of obtaining the archbishop ’ s permission was a direct consequence of the right of the religious community concerned to make its own organisational arrangements and to operate in accordance with the provisions of its Statute."

Nevertheless, the national courts compensated for this omission by obtaining the opinion of the Archdiocese of Craiova and examining the reasons it gave. The County Court concluded, endorsing the reasons put forward by the Archdiocese of Craiova, that if it were to authorise the establishment of the trade union, the consultative and deliberative bodies provided for by the Church ’ s Statute would be replaced by or obliged to work together with a new body – the trade union – not bound by the traditions of the Church and the rules of canon law governing consultation and decision-making. The review undertaken by the court thus confirmed that the risk alleged by the Church authorities was plausible and substantial, that the reasons they put forward did not serve any other purpose unrelated to the exercise of the autonomy of the religious community in question, and that the refusal to register the applicant union did not go beyond what was necessary to eliminate that risk."

More generally, the Court observes that the Statute of the Romanian Orthodox Church does not provide for an absolute ban on members of its clergy forming trade unions to protect their legitimate rights and interests. Accordingly, there is nothing to stop the applicant union ’ s members from availing themselves of their right under Article 11 of the Convention by forming an association of this kind that pursues aims compatible with the Church ’ s Statute and does not call into question the Church ’ s traditional hierarchical structure and decision-making procedures. The Court notes that the applicant union ’ s members are also free to join any of the associations currently existing within the Romanian Orthodox Church which have been authorised by the national courts and operate in accordance with the requirements of the Church ’ s Statute ( see paragraph 52 above )."

They paid contributions to the general social security scheme and were entitled to the full range of welfare benefits. Furthermore, similarly to universities, the Romanian Orthodox Church was allocated funds from the State budget to pay its employees ’ wages. Accordingly, the applicant union submitted that neither the Romanian Orthodox Church ’ s practice of not signing employment contracts with its staff nor the fact that it paid part of their wages from its own funds could affect the actual nature of the relationship between the Church and its employees, since the relationship entailed all the aspects of an employment contract and was similar to that between civil servants and the institution employing them."

It submitted that it could be inferred from these provisions that there was no legislative instrument barring priests from forming a trade union, the refusal of its registration having been based solely on Article 123 § 8 of the Church ’ s Statute; the mere fact that the Statute had been approved by the government did not give it the status of a domestic legislative instrument, let alone that of an institutional Act capable of restricting a constitutional freedom.

Thus, the State made a total of 12, 765 assistance payments to the Orthodox Church, the amounts of which varied between 163 and 364 euros, while the Church paid 1,005 priests and 1,408 lay employees entirely from its own funds. As regards the affiliation of priests and other Church employees to the State social-insurance scheme, the Government submitted that this was the choice of the national Parliament, which enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in such matters; however, their affiliation did not affect their status and did not make them State officials."

Furthermore, the fact that the Trade Unions Act did not explicitly ban priests from forming a trade union did not amount to tacit recognition of that right; instead, exercising its autonomy, the Church had decided that the activities of its staff should be governed by rules other than those of labour law."

                "136. The Court reiterates that religious communities traditionally and universally exist in the form of organised structures. Where the organisation of the religious community is at issue, Article 9 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of Article 11, which safeguards associations against unjustified State interference. Seen from this perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention. The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. It directly concerns not only the organisation of these communities as such but also the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion by all their active members. Were the organisational life of the community not protected by Article 9, all other aspects of the individual ’ s freedom of religion would become vulnerable (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 62, ECHR 2000-XI; Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no. 45701/99, § 118, ECHR 2001-XII; and Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy ) and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 412/03 and 35677/04, § 103, 22 January 2009)."

Similarly, Article 9 of the Convention does not guarantee any right to dissent within a religious body; in the event of a disagreement over matters of doctrine or organisation between a religious community and one of its members, the individual ’ s freedom of religion is exercised through his freedom to leave the community (see Miroļubovs and Others v.

In addressing this question, the Grand Chamber will apply the criteria laid down in the relevant international instruments ( see, mutatis mutandis, Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 85). In this connection, it notes that in Recommendation no. 198 concerning the employment relationship (see paragraph 57 above), the International Labour Organisation (ILO) considers that the determination of the existence of such a relationship should be guided primarily by the facts relating to the performance of work and the remuneration of the worker, notwithstanding how the relationship is characterised in any contrary arrangement, contractual or otherwise, that may have been agreed between the parties. In addition, the ILO ’ s Convention no. 87 (see paragraph 56 above), which is the principal international legal instrument guaranteeing the right to organise, provides in Article 2 that “ workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever ” have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing. Lastly, although Council Directive 2000 /78 / EC ( see paragraph 60 above ) accepts the existence of a heightened degree of loyalty on account of the employer ’ s ethos, it specifies that this cannot prejudice freedom of association, in particular the right to establish unions."

            [
                "143. Having regard to the above considerations, the Court observes that the duties performed by the members of the trade union in question entail many of the characteristic features of an employment relationship. For example, they discharge their activities on the basis of a decision by the bishop appointing them and setting out their rights and obligations. Under the bishop ’ s leadership and supervision, they carry out the tasks assigned to them; besides performing liturgical rites and maintaining contact with parishioners, these tasks include teaching and the management of parish assets; members of the clergy are also responsible for the sale of liturgical items (see paragraph 44 above ). In addition, domestic law provides for a specific number of posts for members of the clergy and laity which are largely funded from the State and local authority budgets, the post-holders ’ wages being set with reference to the salaries of Ministry of Education employees ( see paragraphs 30 et seq. above ). The Romanian Orthodox Church pays employer ’ s contributions on the wages paid to its clergy, and priests pay income tax, contribute to the national social security scheme and are entitled to all the welfare benefits available to ordinary employees, such as health insurance, a pension on reaching the statutory retirement age, or unemployment insurance."
            ],
            [
                "144. Admittedly, as the Government pointed out, a particular feature of the work of members of the clergy is that it also pursues a spiritual purpose and is carried out within a church enjoying a certain degree of autonomy. Accordingly, members of the clergy assume obligations of a special nature in that they are bound by a heightened duty of loyalty, itself based on a personal, and in principle irrevocable, undertaking by each clergyman. It may therefore be a delicate task to make a precise distinction between the strictly religious activities of members of the clergy and their activities of a more financial nature."
            ],
            [
                "145. However, the question to be determined is rather whether such special features are sufficient to remove the relationship between members of the clergy and their church from the ambit of Article 11. In this connection, the Court reiterates that paragraph 1 of Article 11 presents trade-union freedom as one form or a special aspect of freedom of association and that paragraph 2 does not exclude any occupational group from the scope of that Article. At most the national authorities are entitled to impose “lawful restrictions” on certain of their employees in accordance with Article 11 § 2 ( see Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar v. Turkey, no. 28602/95, §§ 28- 29, ECHR 2006 ‑ II). Moreover, other occupational groups, such as the police or the civil service, are likewise subject to particular constraints and special duties of loyalty without their members ’ right to organise being called into question ( see, for example, National Union of Belgian Police, cited above, § 40, and Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 107)."

Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ V). It further reiterates that the phrase “prescribed by law” refers in the first place to national law and that it is not, in principle, for the Court to examine the validity of “ secondary legislation ”, that being primarily a matter for the national courts ( see Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 37, Series A no. 233)."

In the present case, it observes that neither the Constitution nor the institutional Acts on trade unions and religious freedom, nor indeed the Statute of the Church, expressly prohibit members of the clergy or lay staff of the Church from forming trade unions. The domestic courts have inferred such a prohibition from the provisions of the Church ’ s Statute by which the establishment of Church associations and foundations is the prerogative of the Holy Synod and the archbishop ’ s permission is required for members of the clergy to take part in any form of association whatsoever."

However, it is not for the Court to examine this argument, which concerns the validity of a form of “secondary legislation”. The interpretation of the Contracting Parties ’ domestic law is primarily a matter for the national courts ( see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 35, ECHR 1999 ‑ III). In this connection, it must be pointed out that the County Court, sitting as the court of final instance, confined itself to a general observation that under the Trade Unions Act, internal regulations could not contain any provisions that were in breach of the Constitution or other laws. Unlike the Court of First Instance, it did not examine the specific issue of whether the prohibition on forming a trade union without the archbishop ’ s permission was compatible with the provisions of the Constitution. However, the Court considers that since the County Court relied on the Church ’ s Statute in its judgment, it implicitly took the view that the provisions of the Statute were not unconstitutional."

In the Court ’ s opinion, it is the domestic courts ’ task to ensure that both freedom of association and the autonomy of religious communities can be observed within such communities in accordance with the applicable law, including the Convention. Where interferences with the right to freedom of association are concerned, it follows from Article 9 of the Convention that religious communities are entitled to their own opinion on any collective activities of their members that might undermine their autonomy and that this opinion must in principle be respected by the national authorities. However, a mere allegation by a religious community that there is an actual or potential threat to its autonomy is not sufficient to render any interference with its members ’ trade-union rights compatible with the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention. It must also show, in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, that the risk alleged is real and substantial and that the impugned interference with freedom of association does not go beyond what is necessary to eliminate that risk and does not serve any other purpose unrelated to the exercise of the religious community ’ s autonomy. The national courts must ensure that these conditions are satisfied, by conducting an in-depth examination of the circumstances of the case and a thorough balancing exercise between the competing interests at stake ( see, mutatis mutandis, Schüth v.

It asserted that the emergence within the structure of the Church of a new body of this kind would seriously imperil the freedom of religious denominations to organise themselves in accordance with their own traditions, and that the establishment of the trade union would therefore be likely to undermine the Church ’ s traditional hierarchical structure; for these reasons, it argued that it was necessary to limit the trade-union freedom claimed by the applicant union."

In this connection, the Court observes that in Romania, all religious denominations are entitled to adopt their own internal regulations and are thus free to make their own decisions concerning their operations, recruitment of staff and relations with their clergy ( see paragraph 29 above ). The principle of the autonomy of religious communities is the cornerstone of relations between the Romanian State and the religious communities recognised within its territory, including the Romanian Orthodox Church. As the Government indicated, members of the Romanian Orthodox clergy, and hence the priests belonging to the applicant union, perform their duties by virtue of their ministry, their undertaking towards the bishop and the decision issued by the latter; the Romanian Orthodox Church has chosen not to incorporate into its Statute the labour- law provisions which are relevant in this regard, a choice that has been approved by a government ordinance in accordance with the principle of the autonomy of religious communities."

It can only confirm this position in the present case. Respect for the autonomy of religious communities recognised by the State implies, in particular, that the State should accept the right of such communities to react, in accordance with their own rules and interests, to any dissident movements emerging within them that might pose a threat to their cohesion, image or unity. It is therefore not the task of the national authorities to act as the arbiter between religious communities and the various dissident factions that exist or may emerge within them."

It considers that by taking this approach, the County Court was simply applying the principle of the autonomy of religious communities; its refusal of the applicant union ’ s registration for failure to comply with the requirement of obtaining the archbishop ’ s permission was a direct consequence of the right of the religious community concerned to make its own organisational arrangements and to operate in accordance with the provisions of its Statute."

The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( hereinafter referred to as “the Constitution” or “the State Constitution” when it is necessary to distinguish it from the Entity Constitutions ) is an annex to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Dayton Agreement”), initialled at Dayton on 21 November 1995 and signed in Paris on 14 December 1995. Since it was part of a peace treaty, the Constitution was drafted and adopted without the application of procedures which could have provided democratic legitimacy. It constitutes the unique case of a constitution which was never officially published in the official languages of the country concerned but was agreed and published in a foreign language, English. The Constitution confirmed the continuation of the legal existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a State, while modifying its internal structure. In accordance with the Constitution, Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two Entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. The Dayton Agreement failed to resolve the Inter-Entity Boundary Line in the Brčko area, but the parties agreed to a binding arbitration in this regard (Article V of Annex 2 to the Dayton Agreement ). Pursuant to an arbitral award of 5 March 1999, the Brčko District has been created under the exclusive sovereignty of the State."

In the former Yugoslavia, a person ’ s ethnic affiliation was decided solely by that person, through a system of self-classification. Thus, no objective criteria, such as knowledge of a certain language or belonging to a specific religion were required. There was also no requirement of acceptance by other members of the ethnic group in question. The Constitution contains no provisions regarding the determination of one ’ s ethnicity: it appears that it was assumed that the traditional self-classification would suffice."

Conflicts between Norms Regarding Ethnic Discrimination in the Dayton Peace Agreement, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2005, p. 192, and O ’ Brien [5], The Dayton Agreement in Bosnia: Durable Cease-Fire, Permanent Negotiation, in Zartman and Kremenyuk (eds), Peace versus Justice: Negotiating Forward- and Backward-Looking Outcomes, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2005, p. 105 )."

U 5/04 of 31 March 2006 and U 13/05 of 26 May 2006, held that the European Convention on Human Rights did not have priority over the Constitution, it came to a different conclusion in decision no. AP 2678/06 of 29 September 2006. In the latter decision, it examined a discrimination complaint concerning the appellant ’ s ineligibility to stand for election to the Presidency on the ground of his ethnic origin (a Bosniac from the Republika Srpska) and rejected it on the merits. The relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows (the translation has been provided by the Constitutional Court ):",
                "“18. The appellants argue that their rights have been violated, taking into account the fact that Article II § 2 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulates that the rights and freedoms set forth in the European Convention and its Protocols shall apply directly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that they shall have priority over all other law. Therefore, the appellants are of the opinion that the candidacy of Ilijaz Pilav for a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina was rejected exclusively based on his national/ethnic origin in which they see a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention which guarantees that the enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination and that no one shall be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground including the national/ethnic origin.",
                "22. There is no dispute that the provision of Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the provision of Article 8 of the Election Act 2001 have a restrictive character in a way that they restrict the rights of citizens with respect to the candidacy of Bosniacs and Croats from the territory of the Republika Srpska and the Serbs from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to stand for election as members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the purpose of those provisions is strengthening of the position of constituent peoples in order to secure that the Presidency is composed of the representatives from amongst these three constituent peoples. Taking into account the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the restriction imposed by the Constitution and Election Act 2001, which exist with respect to the appellants ’ rights in terms of differential treatment of the appellant ’ s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are Serbs and are directly elected from the territory of the Republika Srpska, is justified at this moment, since there is a reasonable justification for such treatment. Therefore, given the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and specific nature of its constitutional order as well as bearing in mind the current constitutional and law arrangements, the challenged decisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Central Election Commission did not violate the appellants ’ rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since the mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on the law. It means that they serve a legitimate aim, that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants ’ rights are proportional to the objectives of general community in terms of preservation of the established peace, continuation of dialogue, and consequently creation of conditions for amending the mentioned provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Election Act 2001.”"

On numerous occasions, he has imposed ordinary legislation and has amended the Entity Constitutions (the Entity Constitutions, as opposed to the State Constitution, are not part of the Dayton Agreement ). Whether the High Representative ’ s powers also cover the State Constitution is, however, less clear. The Dayton Agreement is silent on this matter, but an episode concerning a typing error in the State Constitution would suggest a negative answer. Several months after the entry into force of the Dayton Agreement, some of the international lawyers who had been present during the Dayton negotiations realised that a reference in Article V § 2 (c) was wrong (the reference to Article III § 1 (a)-(e) was meant to have been a reference to Article V § 3 (a)-(e)). In November 1996 the High Representative, Mr Bildt, wrote a letter to the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr Christopher, and proposed to correct the error by invoking Annex 10 to the Dayton Agreement. Mr Christopher considered that Mr Bildt ’ s authority under Annex 10 did not extend to the State Constitution (see the text of their correspondence in Nystuen, cited above, pp. 80-81). Shortly thereafter, the error was corrected without any formal decision: the High Representative simply informed the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and published a corrected version of the State Constitution. What is relevant to the present case is that the official position of High Representatives has ever since been that the State Constitution is beyond their reach. The speech by Lord Ashdown, in his capacity as High Representative, to the Venice Commission confirms this (see the Report from the 60th Plenary Session of the Venice Commission, CDL-PV(2004)003 of 3 November 2004, p. 18). The relevant part of his speech reads as follows:",

In other words, that, provided Dayton is observed, the powers of the High Representative begin and end with the Dayton texts, and that any alteration to the Constitution enshrined therein is a matter for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their elected representatives to consider.”"

Paragraph 13 of the Resolution asks the Venice Commission to examine several constitutional issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
                "29. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country in transition facing severe economic problems and desiring to take part in European integration. The country will only be able to cope with the numerous challenges resulting from this situation if there is a strong and effective government. The constitutional rules on the functioning of the State organs are however not designed to produce strong government but to prevent the majority from taking decisions adversely affecting other groups. It is understandable that in a post-conflict situation there was (and is) insufficient trust between ethnic groups to allow government on the basis of the majoritarian principle alone. In such a situation specific safeguards have to be found which ensure that all major groups, in Bosnia and Herzegovina the constituent peoples, can accept the constitutional rules and feel protected by them. As a consequence the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution ensures the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples not only through territorial arrangements reflecting their interests but also through the composition of the State organs and the rules on their functioning. In such a situation, a balance has indeed to be struck between the need to protect the interests of all constituent peoples on the one hand and the need for effective government on the other. However, in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution, there are many provisions ensuring the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples, inter alia : the vital interest veto in the Parliamentary Assembly, the two - chamber system and the collective Presidency on an ethnic basis. The combined effect of these provisions makes effective government extremely difficult, if not impossible. Hitherto the system has more or less functioned due to the paramount role of the High Representative. This role is however not sustainable.",
                "30. The most important mechanism ensuring that no decisions are taken against the interest of any constituent people is the vital interest veto. If the majority of the Bosniac, Croat or Serb delegates in the House of Peoples declare that a proposed decision of the Parliamentary Assembly is destructive to a vital interest of their people, the majority of Bosniac, Serb and Croat delegates have to vote for the decision for it to be adopted. The majority of delegates from another people may object to the invocation of the clause. In this case a conciliation procedure is foreseen and ultimately a decision is taken by the Constitutional Court as to the procedural regularity of the invocation. It is noteworthy that the Constitution does not define the notion of vital interest veto, contrary to the Entity Constitutions which provide a (excessively broad) definition.",
                "31. It is obvious, and was confirmed by many interlocutors, that this procedure entails a serious risk of blocking decision-making. Others argued that this risk should not be overestimated since the procedure has rarely been used and the Constitutional Court in a decision of 25 June 2004 started to interpret the notion [see decision U-8/04 on the vital interest veto against the Framework Law on Higher Education]. The decision indeed indicates that the Court does not consider that the vital interest is a purely subjective notion within the discretion of each member of parliament and which would not be subject to review by the Court. On the contrary, the Court examined the arguments put forward to justify the use of the vital interest veto, upheld one argument and rejected another.",
                "32. The Commission is nevertheless of the opinion that a precise and strict definition of vital interest in the Constitution is necessary. The main problem with veto powers is not their use but their preventive effect. Since all politicians involved are fully conscious of the existence of the possibility of a veto, an issue with respect to which a veto can be expected will not even be put to the vote. Due to the existence of the veto, a delegation taking a particularly intransigent position and refusing to compromise is in a strong position. It is true that further case-law from the Constitutional Court may provide a definition of the vital interest and reduce the risks inherent in the mechanism. This may however take a long time and it also seems inappropriate to leave such a task with major political implications to the Court alone without providing it with guidance in the text of the Constitution.",
                "33. Under present conditions within Bosnia and Herzegovina, it seems unrealistic to ask for a complete abolition of the vital interest veto. The Commission nevertheless considers that it would be important and urgent to provide a clear definition of the vital interest in the text of the Constitution. This definition will have to be agreed by the representatives of the three constituent peoples but should not correspond to the present definition in the Entity Constitutions which allows practically anything being defined as vital interest. It should not be excessively broad but focus on rights of particular importance to the respective peoples, mainly in areas such as language, education and culture.",
                "34. In addition to the vital interest veto, Article IV § 3 ( d) of the Constitution provides for a veto by two-thirds of the delegation from either Entity. This veto, which in practice seems potentially relevant only for the Republika Srpska, appears redundant having regard to the existence of the vital interest veto.",
                "35. Article IV of the Constitution provides for a bicameral system with a House of Representatives and a House of Peoples both having the same powers. Bicameral systems are typical for federal States and it is therefore not surprising that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution opts for two chambers. However, the usual purpose of the second chamber in federal States is to ensure a stronger representation of the smaller entities. One chamber is composed on the basis of population figures while in the other either all entities have the same number of seats (Switzerland, USA) or at least smaller entities are overrepresented (Germany). In Bosnia and Herzegovina this is quite different: in both chambers two-thirds of the members come from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the difference being that in the House of Peoples only the Bosniacs and Croats from the Federation and the Serbs from the Republika Srpska are represented. The House of Peoples is therefore not a reflection of the federal character of the State but an additional mechanism favouring the interests of the constituent peoples. The main function of the House of Peoples under the Constitution is indeed as the chamber where the vital interest veto is exercised.",
                "36. The drawback of this arrangement is that the House of Representatives becomes the chamber where legislative work is done and necessary compromises are made in order to achieve a majority. The role of the House of Peoples is only negative as a veto chamber, where members see as their task to exclusively defend the interests of their people without having a stake in the success of the legislative process. It would therefore seem preferable to move the exercise of the vital interest veto to the House of Representatives and abolish the House of Peoples. This would streamline procedures and facilitate the adoption of legislation without endangering the legitimate interests of any people. It would also solve the problem of the discriminatory composition of the House of Peoples.",
                "37. Article V of the Constitution provides for a collective Presidency with one Bosniac, one Serb and one Croat member and a rotating chair. The Presidency endeavours to take its decisions by consensus (Article V § 2 ( c ) ). In case of a decision by a majority, a vital interest veto can be exercised by the member in the minority.",
                "38. A collective Presidency is a highly unusual arrangement. As regards the representational functions of Head of State, these are more easily carried out by one person. At the top of the executive there is already one collegiate body, the Council of Ministers, and adding a second collegiate body does not seem conducive to effective decision-making. This creates a risk of duplication of decision-making processes and it becomes difficult to distinguish the powers of the Council of Ministers and of the Presidency. Moreover, the Presidency will either not have the required technical knowledge available within ministries or need substantial staff, creating an additional layer of bureaucracy.",
                "39. A collective Presidency therefore does not appear functional or efficient. Within the context of Bosnia and Herzegovina, its existence seems again motivated by the need to ensure participation by representatives from all constituent peoples in all important decisions. A single President with important powers seems indeed difficult to envisage for Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
                "40. The best solution therefore would be to concentrate executive power within the Council of Ministers as a collegiate body in which all constituent peoples are represented. Then a single President as Head of State should be acceptable. Having regard to the multi-ethnic character of the country, an indirect election of the President by the Parliamentary Assembly with a majority ensuring that the President enjoys wide confidence within all peoples would seem preferable to direct elections. Rules on rotation providing that a newly elected President may not belong to the same constituent people as his predecessor may be added.",
                "74. In the present case, the distribution of posts in the State organs between the constituent peoples was a central element of the Dayton Agreement making peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina possible. In such a context, it is difficult to deny legitimacy to norms that may be problematic from the point of view of non-discrimination but necessary to achieve peace and stability and to avoid further loss of human lives. The inclusion of such rules in the text of the Constitution [of Bosnia and Herzegovina] at that time therefore does not deserve criticism, even though they run counter to the general thrust of the Constitution aiming at preventing discrimination.",
                "75. This justification has to be considered, however, in the light of developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the entry into force of the Constitution. Bosnia and Herzegovina has become a member of the Council of Europe and the country has therefore to be assessed according to the yardstick of common European standards. It has now ratified the [European Convention on Human Rights] and Protocol No. 12 [thereto]. As set forth above, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has evolved in a positive sense but there remain circumstances requiring a political system that is not a simple reflection of majority rule but which guarantees a distribution of power and positions among ethnic groups. It therefore remains legitimate to try to design electoral rules ensuring appropriate representation for various groups.",
                "76. This can, however, be achieved without entering into conflict with international standards. It is not the system of consensual democracy as such which raises problems but the mixing of territorial and ethnic criteria and the apparent exclusion from certain political rights of those who appear particularly vulnerable. It seems possible to redesign the rules on the Presidency to make them compatible with international standards while maintaining the political balance in the country.",
                "77. A multi-ethnic composition can be ensured in a non-discriminatory way, for example by providing that not more than one member of the Presidency may belong to the same people or the Others and combining this with an electoral system ensuring representation of both Entities. Or, as suggested above, as a more radical solution which would be preferable in the view of the Commission, the collective Presidency could be abolished and replaced by an indirectly elected President with very limited powers.",
                "80. The House of Peoples is a chamber with full legislative powers. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the [European Convention on Human Rights] is thereby applicable and any discrimination on ethnic grounds is thereby prohibited by Article 14 of the [Convention]. As to a possible justification, the same considerations as with respect to the Presidency apply. While it is a legitimate aim to try to ensure an ethnic balance within Parliament in the interest of peace and stability, this can justify ethnic discrimination only if there are no other means to achieve this goal and if the rights of minorities are adequately respected. For the House of Peoples it would for example be possible to fix a maximum number of seats to be occupied by representatives from each constituent people. Or, as argued above, a more radical solution which would have the preference of the Commission, could be chosen and the House of Peoples simply be abolished and the vital national interest mechanism be exercised within the House of Representatives. ”",

By letter dated 2 March 2006 the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Sulejman Tihić, asked the Venice Commission to provide an Opinion on three different proposals for the election of the Presidency of this country.

The issue of the election of the Presidency remains to be resolved in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive reform package.",
                "8. Proposal I would consist of maintaining the present rules on the election and composition of the Presidency, with one Bosniac and one Croat elected from the territory of the Federation and one Serb elected from the territory of Republika Srpska. In its [ Opinion on the constitutional situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the powers of the High Representative] the Commission raised serious concerns as to the compatibility with Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention of Human Rights of such a rule, which formally excludes Others as well as Bosniacs and Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbs from the Federation from being elected to the Presidency. Maintaining this rule as it stands should therefore be excluded and Proposal I be rejected.",
                "9. Proposal II, which is not drafted as text to be included in the Constitution but as a summary of possible constitutional content, maintains the system of directly electing two members of the Presidency from the Federation and one from Republika Srpska, however without mentioning any ethnic criteria for the candidates. The de jure discrimination pointed out in the Venice Commission Opinion would therefore be removed and adoption of this proposal would constitute a step forward. The Proposal also includes a rotation of the President of the Presidency every 16 months. Within the logic of a collective Presidency, this appears as a rational solution.",
                "10. By contrast, the Proposal lacks clarity as to the pluri-ethnic composition of the Presidency. The collective Presidency was introduced, and supposedly will now be maintained, in order to ensure that no single State organ is dominated by a representative of a single constituent people. As it stands, under the proposal it would be possible to, for example, elect two Bosniacs from the Federation to the Presidency. Legally, this drawback could be remedied in the framework of the Proposal by providing that not more than one member of the Presidency may belong at the same time to the same constituent people or the group of Others. It is the understanding of the Commission that the intention is indeed to include such a provision in the Constitution in case this proposal is adopted.",
                "11. However, the problem would result of having to possibly exclude from the Presidency candidates who have received a higher number of votes. In the Federation it is quite possible that two Bosniacs would attain the highest number of votes. In this case, a candidate who obtained more votes would have to be barred from the Presidency in favour of a candidate who obtained fewer votes. These issues should be regulated clearly at the level of the Constitution and not be left to ordinary law.",
                "12. As a further drawback, de facto Bosniacs and Croats from the Republika Srpska and Serbs from the Federation would also continue to have no realistic possibility to elect a candidate of their preference.",
                "13. Furthermore, the election of the Head of State would continue to take place on an Entity basis while it would be desirable to move it to the State level as part of the overall approach of strengthening the State.",
                "14. As a minor issue, the proposal would also allow members of the Presidency to hold a leadership position in a political party. This does not seem in line with the overall aim of constitutional reform of transforming the Presidency from an executive body into a (collective) Head of State.",
                "15. To sum up, Proposal II is a clear improvement with respect to the present constitutional situation. However, it has a number of drawbacks, including the risk that candidates with less votes than others are elected and it does not contribute to the overall aims of the constitutional reform of moving power to the Council of Ministers and strengthening the State level.",
                "16. Proposal III differs more markedly from the present constitutional situation by introducing a complicated procedure of indirect elections for the Presidency. As set forth above, the main preference of the Commission is for the indirect election of a single President with reduced powers. But also in the case of a collective Presidency, the Commission maintains its preference for indirect elections.",
                "17. The reason is, first of all, that one of the main aims of the constitutional reform would be to reduce the powers of the Presidency and to concentrate executive power in the Council of Ministers. This change will be more difficult to bring about if the Presidency does have the legitimacy of a direct popular vote.",
                "18. Moreover, in an indirect election it is easier to devise mechanisms ensuring the desired pluri-ethnic composition of the Presidency. It offers more possibilities for inter-ethnic cooperation and compromise while direct elections for de facto separate ethnic slots provide an incentive to vote for the person considered as the strongest advocate of the respective constituent people and not for the candidate best suited to defend the interests of the country as a whole.",
                "19. Finally, the Proposal moves the election to the State Parliament. It is indeed desirable and in line with the overall aim of strengthening the State to have the election of the Head of State at this level.",
                "20. From the point of view of the overall approach, Proposal III therefore seems preferable. There are nevertheless some drawbacks.",
                "21. First of all, the proposal seems complicated with too many steps and possibilities for stalemate. Nominations can be put forward by members of the House of Representatives or the House of Peoples, the selection of the candidates takes place by the three separate ethnic caucuses in the House of Peoples and thereafter the slate of candidates has to be confirmed both by the three caucuses in the House of Peoples and by the House of Representatives.",
                "22. Within the parameters of the proposal, it would seem preferable to have a simpler procedure with more focus on the House of Representatives as the body having direct democratic legitimacy derived from the people as a whole. The possibility to nominate candidates should be reserved to members of the House of Representatives, selection among these candidates could take place in the three separate ethnic caucuses of the House of Peoples to ensure that the interests of all three constituent peoples are respected and the slate of candidates would have to be confirmed by the majority of the composition of the House of Representatives, ensuring that all three members have legitimacy as representatives of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole."

            [
                "23. In addition, it should be clarified how the positions of the President and Vice-Presidents are to be distributed. As it stands, Proposal III leaves this important decision implicitly to backroom dealing between the three ethnic caucuses since a slate identifying President and Vice-Presidents has to be submitted to the House of Representatives, while no indication is provided on how this choice has to be made. This seems the worst possible solution and likely to lead to stalemate. The rotation envisaged by Proposal II seems more feasible."

In its above-mentioned Opinion, the Commission argued in favour of abolishing the House of Peoples. Giving it a strong role in the selection of the Presidency cannot therefore be considered a positive step. The role of ethnic caucuses makes the election of candidates not belonging to a constituent people extremely unlikely. This is however not peculiar to this Proposal but reflects the political situation. The proposal at least ensures that the representatives of the Others in the House of Representatives will take part in the vote and that Serbs from the Federation and Bosniacs and Croats from Republika Srpska are no longer disadvantaged since their representatives in the State Parliament will be able to vote for the candidates of their choice."

Since the constitutional reform has to be adopted urgently in order to make it possible to take it into account at the parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2006, he expressed the wish to receive the Opinion of the Venice Commission ‘ shortly ’.",
                "Amendment II to Article IV of the Constitution on the Parliamentary Assembly",
                "22. The main aim of the Amendment is to move from a bicameralism with two equal chambers to a new system where the House of Peoples ... would have only limited powers with a focus on the vital national interests veto. The new structure of the Article, systematically putting the House of Representatives ... first, reflects this aim. The reform would be a step in the direction of the Venice Commission recommendation to abolish the [ House of Peoples ] and to streamline decision-making within the State institutions.",
                "24. Sub-section (d) would increase the number of members of the [ House of Peoples ] from 15 to 21. The justification of the increase in the membership of this House is less apparent since its powers are greatly reduced. Nevertheless, this is an issue entirely within the discretion of the national authorities. If they feel that this increase is required to ensure that the House adequately represents the political spectrum, this step seems justifiable.",
                "25. More problematic is the circumstance that membership in this House remains limited under sub-section (d) to people belonging to one of the three constituent peoples. In its Opinion [on the constitutional situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the powers of the High Representative] the Venice Commission noted that the previous composition of this House along similar lines seemed to contradict Article 14 of the [European Convention on Human Rights] in conjunction with Article 3 of [ Protocol No. 1 ].",
                "26. Following the reform the House of Peoples would however no longer be a full legislative chamber but a body dealing mainly with the vital national interests veto. It seems therefore questionable whether Article 3 of [ Protocol No. 1 ] and thereby Article 14 of the [Convention] would still be applicable. The problem of the compatibility of this provision with Protocol No. 12 [to the Convention ] remains however. In the absence of any case-law on this Protocol, it can be interpreted only with prudence. ...",
                "27. In the present case the legitimate aim could be seen in the main role of the House as a body in which the vital national interests veto is exercised. The [ Bosnia and Herzegovina ] Constitution reserves the right to exercise this veto to the three constituent peoples and does not give it to the Others. From that perspective it would not seem required to include ‘ Others ’ in the composition of this House. The other responsibilities of the House, to participate in the election of the Presidency and to approve constitutional amendments – though not beyond criticism –, do not lead to a different result. They show that the function of the [ House of Peoples ] is to be a corrective mechanism, ensuring that the application of the democratic principle reflected in the composition of the [ House of Representatives ] does not disturb the balance among the three constituent peoples. The need for such a mechanism seems still to be felt in [ Bosnia and Herzegovina ]. In that case it seems possible to regard this need as a legitimate aim justifying an unequal treatment of Others in respect to representation in the [ House of Peoples ].",

                "43. The main aim of the Amendments is to strengthen the powers of the Council of Ministers and increase its efficiency and reduce the role of the Presidency. This is entirely in line with the Opinion [on the constitutional situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the powers of the High Representative] of the Venice Commission. In addition, the Commission would have preferred having a single President instead of a collective Presidency. This does however not seem politically possible at the moment. Nevertheless Amendment III takes a first step in this direction.",
                "46. The Venice Commission adopted an Opinion on the three alternative proposals for electing the Presidency at its last session (CDL-AD(2006)004). It would serve no purpose to re-open this discussion at the present moment. The absence of a dead-lock breaking mechanism if the [ House of Representatives ] refuses to confirm the proposal of the [ House of Peoples ] is however a concern.",

The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) is the Council of Europe ’ s independent human rights monitoring body specialised in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, anti -Semitism and intolerance. In its General Policy Recommendation No. 7, adopted on 13 December 2002, ECRI defines racism as “the belief that a ground such as race [6], colour, language, religion, nationality or national or ethnic origin justifies contempt for a person or a group of persons, or the notion of superiority of a person or a group of persons”.",

                "“ The 1 October general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first elections since the 1995 Dayton Agreement to be fully administered by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities. The manner in which these elections were conducted was generally in line with international standards for democratic elections, although further efforts are needed, particularly with regard to the vote count. Therefore, overall, the elections represented further progress in the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law. However, it was regrettable that, due to constitutional ethnicity-based limitations to the right to stand for office, the elections were again in violation of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and of the commitments made to the Council of Europe, as well as Article 7.3 of the OSCE 1990 Copenhagen Document.”",
                "25. In 2008 Bosnia and Herzegovina signed and ratified a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union and thereby committed itself to addressing the European Partnership priorities. One of the key priorities for Bosnia and Herzegovina, expected to be accomplished within one to two years, is to “amend electoral legislation regarding members of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency and House of Peoples delegates to ensure full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe post-accession commitments ” (see Annex to Council Decision 2008/211/EC of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and repealing Decision 2006/55/EC, Official Journal of the European Union L 0 80 ( 19 March 2008) ).",

It is reiterated that in order to be able to lodge a petition by virtue of Article 34 of the Convention, a person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals must be able to claim to be the victim of a violation of the rights set forth in the Convention. In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure. The Convention does not, therefore, envisage the bringing of an actio popularis for the interpretation of the rights set out therein or permit individuals to complain about a provision of national law simply because they consider, without having been directly affected by it, that it may contravene the Convention. It is, however, open to applicants to contend that a law violates their rights, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if they belong to a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation or if they are required either to modify their conduct or risk being prosecuted (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, §§ 33 ‑ 34, ECHR 2008, and the authorities cited therein ).",

In the present case, given the applicants ’ active participation in public life, it would be entirely coherent that they would in fact consider running for the House of Peoples or the Presidency. The applicants may therefore claim to be victims of the alleged discrimination. The fact that the present case raises the question of the compatibility of the national Constitution with the Convention is irrelevant in this regard (see, by analogy, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, ECHR 1999 ‑ III).",

Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII). The power to amend it was, however, vested in the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is clearly a domestic body (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, the practice set out in paragraph 17 above confirms that the powers of the international administrator for Bosnia and Herzegovina (the High Representative) do not extend to the State Constitution. In those circumstances, leaving aside the question whether the respondent State could be held responsible for putting in place the contested constitutional provisions (see paragraph 13 above), the Court considers that it could nevertheless be held responsible for maintaining them."

Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII ). The applicants submitted that difference in treatment based expressly on race or ethnicity was not capable of justification and amounted to direct discrimination. In this regard, they referred to the Court ’ s case-law (notably, Timishev, cited above, § 58, and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 176, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV ) and to European Union legislation ( such as Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 – the “Race Directive” – implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, which in Article 2 explicitly included under its definition of indirect discrimination the possibility of objectively justifying the treatment, but made no such justification possible under its definition of direct discrimination). They further submitted that this impossibility of justification was particularly important in a case concerning the right to stand for election (they referred to Aziz v. Cyprus, no. 69949/01, § 28, ECHR 2004 ‑ V)."

Furthermore, the length of time during which the exclusion had continued increased even more the burden on the respondent Government to justify it ( they referred to a decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee of 8 April 1981 in the case of Silva and Others v. Uruguay, § 8.4). The applicants concluded that the respondent Government had failed to demonstrate that the difference in treatment was justified in the instant case.",

The current constitutional structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina was established by a peace agreement following one of the most destructive conflicts in recent European history. Its ultimate goal was the establishment of peace and dialogue between the three main ethnic groups – the “constituent peoples”. The Government maintained that the contested constitutional provisions, excluding persons who did not declare affiliation with a “constituent people” from the House of Peoples and the Presidency, should be assessed against this background. They claimed that the time was still not ripe for a political system which would be a simple reflection of majority rule, given, in particular, the prominence of mono-ethnic political parties and the continued international administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Based on an analysis of the Contracting Parties ’ legal systems, the AIRE Centre concluded that a European consensus had emerged that it was appropriate to withdraw an individual ’ s right to stand for office only as a result of his or her conduct, as opposed to innate or inalienable characteristics. The Open Society Justice Initiative underlined that political participation represented one of the rights and responsibilities that maintained the legal bond between a citizen and a State. In most jurisdictions, the rights to vote, to be elected and to stand for office were what most clearly distinguished a citizen from an alien. Restrictions on these rights, particularly on the suspect grounds of race and ethnicity, were, therefore, not only discriminatory, but undermined the meaning of citizenship itself. Aside from being an important right linked with citizenship, political participation was particularly important for ethnic minorities and essential to overcoming their marginalization and bringing them into the mainstream. This was particularly true following an ethnic conflict, where legally entrenched distinctions based on ethnicity could exacerbate tensions, rather than fostering the constructive and sustainable relations between all ethnicities that were essential to a viable multiethnic State.",

                "39. It is noted that Article 14 complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous –, there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 71, Series A no. 94; Petrovic v. Austria, 27 March 1998, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II; and Sahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, § 85, ECHR 2003-VIII ). The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court ’ s case-law (see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium ” v. Belgium ( merits), 23 July 1968, § 9, Series A no. 6; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 40, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; and E.B. v.

In this connection, it is reiterated that this provision applies only to elections of a “legislature”, or at least of one of its chambers if it has two or more. However, the word “legislature” has to be interpreted in the light of each State ’ s constitutional structure (see Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 40, ECHR 1999-I) and, in particular, its constitutional traditions and the scope of the legislative powers of the chamber in question. Furthermore, the travaux préparatoires demonstrate (vol. VIII, pp. 46, 50 and 52) that the Contracting Parties took into account the particular position of certain parliaments which included non-elective chambers. Thus, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was carefully drafted so as to avoid terms which could be interpreted as an absolute obligation to hold elections for both chambers in each and every bicameral system (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, § 53, Series A no. 113). At the same time, however, it is clear that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 applies to any of a parliament ’ s chambers to be filled through direct elections."

As regards the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Court notes that its composition is the result of indirect elections, its members being appointed by the Entities ’ legislatures. In addition, the Court observes that the extent of the legislative powers enjoyed by it is a decisive factor here. The House of Peoples indeed enjoys wide powers to control the passage of legislation : Article IV § 3 (c) of the Constitution specifically provides that no legislation can be adopted without the approval of both chambers. Furthermore, the House of Peoples, together with the House of Representatives, decides upon the sources and amounts of revenues for the operations of the State institutions and international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina and approves a budget of the State institutions (see Article IV § 4 (b)-(c) of the Constitution). Lastly, its consent is necessary before a treaty can be ratified (see Articles IV § 4 (d) and V § 3 (d) of the Constitution).

Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 81, ECHR 2009 ).

Whereas the notion of race is rooted in the idea of biological classification of human beings into subspecies on the basis of morphological features such as skin colour or facial characteristics, ethnicity has its origin in the idea of societal groups marked in particular by common nationality, religious faith, shared language, or cultural and traditional origins and backgrounds. Discrimination on account of a person ’ s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination (see the definition adopted by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in paragraph 19 above and that adopted by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance in paragraph 23 above ). Racial discrimination is a particularly egregious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy ’ s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 145, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, and Timishev, cited above, § 56)."

That being said, Article 14 does not prohibit Contracting Parties from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them. Indeed, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may, without an objective and reasonable justification, give rise to a breach of that Article ( see Case “relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium”, cited above, § 10; Thlimmenos v.

The applicants, who describe themselves to be of Roma and Jewish origin respectively and who do not wish to declare affiliation with a “constituent people”, are, as a result, excluded (see paragraph 11 above). The Court notes that this exclusion rule pursued at least one aim which is broadly compatible with the general objectives of the Convention, as reflected in the Preamble to the Convention, namely the restoration of peace. When the impugned constitutional provisions were put in place a very fragile ceasefire was in effect on the ground. The provisions were designed to end a brutal conflict marked by genocide and “ ethnic cleansing ”. The nature of the conflict was such that the approval of the “constituent peoples” (namely, the Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs) was necessary to ensure peace. This could explain, without necessarily justifying, the absence of representatives of the other communities (such as local Roma and Jewish communities) at the peace negotiations and the participants ’ preoccupation with effective equality between the “constituent peoples” in the post-conflict society."

Furthermore, whereas the maintenance of an international administration as an enforcement measure under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter implies that the situation in the region still constitutes a “threat to international peace and security”, it appears that preparations for the closure of that administration are under way (see a joint report by Mr Javier Solana, the European Union ’ s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Mr Olli Rehn, European Union Commissioner for Enlargement, on “ EU ’ s Policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina: The Way Ahead ” of 10 November 2008, and a report by the International Crisis Group on “ Bosnia ’ s Incomplete Transition: Between Dayton and Europe ” of 9 March 2009)."

In particular, this jurisprudence has made it clear that “ discrimination ” means treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in similar situations (see paragraphs 42 - 44 above and the authorities cited therein ). The authors used the same term, “ discrimination ”, in Article 1 of Protocol No. 12. Notwithstanding the difference in scope between those provisions, the meaning of this term in Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 was intended to be identical to that in Article 14 (see paragraph 18 of the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 12). The Court does not therefore see any reason to depart from the settled interpretation of “discrimination”, noted above, in applying the same term under Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 (as regards the case-law of the United Nations Human Rights Committee on Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a provision similar – although not identical – to Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the Convention, see Nowak, U.N.

Moldova ’ s obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the [Convention] rights and freedoms”, was, however, limited in the circumstances to a positive obligation to take the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with international law (ibid., § 331).

                "“40. At the outset of the visit, the authorities of the Transnistrian region provided the delegation with detailed information on the five penitentiary establishments currently in service in the region.",
                "In the time available, the delegation was not in a position to make a thorough examination of the whole of the penitentiary system. However, it was able to make an assessment of the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty in Prison No. 1, at Glinoe, Colony No. 2, at Tiraspol, and the SIZO (i.e. pre-trial) section of Colony No. 3, again at Tiraspol.",
                "41. As the authorities are certainly already aware, the situation in the establishments visited by the delegation leaves a great deal to be desired, in particular in Prison No. 1. The CPT will examine various specific areas of concern in subsequent sections of this report. However, at the outset, the Committee wishes to highlight what is perhaps the principal obstacle to progress, namely the high number of persons who are imprisoned and the resultant overcrowding.",
                "42. According to the information provided by the authorities, there are approximately 3,500 prisoners in the region ’ s penitentiary establishments i.e. an incarceration rate of some 450 persons per 100,000 of the population. The number of inmates in the three establishments visited was within or, in the case of Prison No 1, just slightly over their official capacities. Nevertheless, the delegation found that in fact the establishments were severely overcrowded.",
                "The situation was at its most serious in Prison No 1. The cells for pre-trial prisoners offered rarely more – and sometimes less – than 1 m² of living space per prisoner, and the number of prisoners often exceeded the number of beds. These deplorable conditions were frequently made worse by poor ventilation, insufficient access to natural light and inadequate sanitary facilities. Similar, albeit slightly better, conditions were also observed in the Sizo section of Colony No. 3 and in certain parts of Colony No. 2 (for example, Block 10).",
                "43. An incarceration rate of the magnitude which presently prevails in the Transnistrian region cannot be convincingly explained away by a high crime rate; the general outlook of members of the law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and judges must, in part, be responsible for the situation. At the same time, it is unrealistic from an economic standpoint to offer decent conditions of detention to such vast numbers of prisoners; to attempt to solve the problem by building more penitentiary establishments would be a ruinous exercise.",
                "The CPT has already stressed the need to review current law and practice relating to custody pending trial ... More generally, the Committee recommends that an overall strategy be developed for combating prison overcrowding and reducing the size of the prison population. In this context, the authorities will find useful guidance in the principles and measures set out in Recommendation No R (99) 22 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation ...",
                "48. The CPT recognises that in periods of economic difficulties, sacrifices may have to be made, including in penitentiary establishments. However, regardless of the difficulties faced at any given time, the act of depriving a person of his liberty always entails a duty to ensure that that person has access to certain basic necessities. Those basic necessities include appropriate medication. Compliance with this duty by public authorities is all the more imperative when it is a question of medication required to treat a life-threatening disease such as tuberculosis.",
                "At the end of the visit, the CPT ’ s delegation requested the authorities to take steps without delay to ensure that all penitentiary establishments are supplied on a regular basis with medicines of various types and, in particular, with a suitable range of anti ‑ tuberculosis drugs. The CPT wishes to be informed of the action taken in response to that request.",
                "49. Official health-care staffing levels in the penitentiary establishments visited were rather low and, at the time of the visit, this situation was exacerbated by the fact that certain posts were vacant or staff members on long-term leave had not been replaced. This was particularly the case at Prison No 1 and Colony No 2. The CPT recommends that the authorities strive to fill as soon as possible all vacant posts in the health-care services of those two establishments and to replace staff members who are on leave.",
                "The health-care services of all three penitentiary establishments visited had very few medicines at their disposal, and their facilities were modestly equipped. The question of the supply of medicines has already been addressed (cf. paragraph 48). As regards the level of equipment, the CPT appreciates that the existing situation is a reflection of the difficulties facing the region; it would be unrealistic to expect significant improvements at the present time. However, it should be possible to maintain all existing equipment in working order. In this context, the delegation noted that all the radiography machines in the establishments visited were out of use. The CPT recommends that this deficiency be remedied.",
                "On a more positive note, the CPT was very interested to learn of the authorities ’ plans for a new prison hospital, with a region-wide vocation, at Malaieşti. This is a most welcome development. The Committee would like to receive further details concerning the implementation of those plans.",
                "51. The CPT has already highlighted the poor material conditions of detention which prevailed in the establishments visited and has made recommendations designed to address the fundamental problem of overcrowding (cf. paragraphs 42 and 43).",
                "In addition to overcrowding, the CPT is very concerned by the practice of covering cell windows. This practice appeared to be systematic vis-à-vis remand prisoners, and was also observed in cells accommodating certain categories of sentenced prisoners. The Committee recognises that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners. However, the imposition of such security measures should be the exception rather than the rule. Further, even when specific security measures are required, such measures should never involve depriving the prisoners concerned of natural light and fresh air. The latter are basic elements of life which every prisoner is entitled to enjoy; moreover, the absence of these elements generates conditions favourable to the spread of diseases and in particular tuberculosis.",
                "It is also inadmissible for cells to accommodate more prisoners than the number of beds available, thereby compelling prisoners to sleep in shifts.",
                "Consequently, the CPT recommends that the authorities set the following as short-term objectives:",
                "i) all prisoner accommodation to have access to natural light and adequate ventilation;",
                "ii) every prisoner, whether sentenced or on remand, to have his/her own bed.",
                "Further, as measures to tackle overcrowding begin to take effect, the existing standards concerning living space per prisoner should be revised upwards. The CPT recommends that the authorities set, as a medium-term objective, meeting the standard of 4m² of floor space per prisoner.",
                "52. As the delegation pointed out at the end of its visit, material conditions of detention were particularly bad at Prison No 1 in Glinoe. The CPT appreciates that under the present circumstances, the authorities have no choice but to keep this establishment in service. However, the premises of Prison No 1 belong to a previous age; they should cease to be used for penitentiary purposes at the earliest opportunity. ”",

The mediators from the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the OSCE held consultations with representatives from Chisinau and Tiraspol in January, May and September. At the May meeting, Ukraine introduced President Victor Yushchenko ’ s settlement plan, Toward a Settlement through Democratization.

During consultations in September in Odessa, Chisinau and Tiraspol agreed to invite the EU and US to participate as observers in the negotiations. Formal negotiations resumed in an enlarged format in October after a 15-month break and continued in December following the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana. On 15 December, the Presidents of Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Victor Yushchenko and Vladimir Putin, issued a Joint Statement welcoming the resumption of negotiations on the settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict.",

In parallel, the OSCE Mission conducted technical consultations and analyses on basic requirements for democratic elections in the Transdniestrian region, as proposed in the Yushchenko Plan. At the October negotiating round, the OSCE Chairmanship was asked to continue consultations on the possibility of organizing an IAM to the Transdniestrian region.",
                "Together with military experts from the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the OSCE Mission completed development of a package of proposed confidence- and security ‑ building measures, which were presented by the three mediators in July. The Mission subsequently began consultations on the package with representatives of Chisinau and Tiraspol. The October negotiating round welcomed possible progress on enhancing transparency through a mutual exchange of military data, as envisaged in elements of this package.”",

The commander of the Operative Group of Russian Forces reported in May that surplus stocks of 40,000 small arms and light weapons stored by Russian forces in the Transdniestrian region have been destroyed. The OSCE has not been allowed to verify these claims.”",

                "To spur on the settlement talks, the Mission drafted in early 2006 documents that suggested: a possible delimitation of competencies between central and regional authorities; a mechanism for monitoring factories in the Transnistrian military ‑ industrial complex; a plan for the exchange of military data; and an assessment mission to evaluate conditions and make recommendations for democratic elections in Transnistria. The Transnistrian side, however, refused to continue negotiations after the March introduction of new customs rules for Transnistrian exports, and thus no progress could be made including on these projects. Attempts to unblock this stalemate through consultations among the mediators (OSCE, Russian Federation and Ukraine) and the observers (European Union and the United States of America) in April, May and November and consultations of the mediators and observers with each of the sides separately in October were to no avail.",
                "On 13 November, a group of 30 OSCE Heads of Delegations, along with OSCE Mission members, gained access for the first time since March 2004 to the Russian Federation ammunition depot in Colbasna, near the Moldovan-Ukrainian border in northern Transnistria. There were no withdrawals, however, of Russian ammunition or equipment from Transnistria during 2006, and more than 21,000 tons of ammunition remain stored in the region. ...”",

The mediators and observers met informally with the Moldovan and Transnistrian sides once, in October. All meetings concentrated on finding ways to restart formal settlement negotiations, which have nonetheless failed to resume.",

Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, § 76, ECHR 2001-IV), a State could be considered to be exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction if it (a) continued to exercise control through subordinate local authorities and (b) kept control over the whole territory owing to the presence of a large number of troops and “practically exercised a global control over” the relevant territory. Neither of these two conditions was met in the present case. The situation was similar to that in Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others ((dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII), in which the Court had recognised that jurisdiction could only be extended extraterritorially in exceptional cases."

Moreover, the concept of “effective control” as applied by the Court when establishing whether a State exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction was at variance with its meaning in public international law. The notion of “effective and overall control” had first appeared in the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but had a different meaning there. Comparing the present situation to that in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua ( (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, §§ 109-15), the Russian Government argued that they had much less influence over the “MRT” authorities than the United States of America had had over the rebels in Nicaragua, notably in terms of the strength of Russia ’ s military presence in the “MRT”. In fact, Russia was one of the mediators of the conflict between Moldova and the self ‑ proclaimed “MRT”. The ICJ had confirmed its position in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 43 – “the Bosnian Genocide case” ). The notion of “overall control” had been further developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The Court ’ s interpretation of this notion differed from the interpretations of these international tribunals."

It could not be said that Russia exercised jurisdiction in the present case, where the territory was controlled by a de facto government which was not an organ or instrument of Russia and which did not depend on Russia in any way. On the contrary, Russia considered the “MRT” to be an integral part of the Republic of Moldova. Russia ’ s military presence was restricted to a limited number of peacekeepers; therefore, there were no grounds for concluding that it exercised control through the strength of its military presence. The Russian Government referred in that connection to Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 55721/07, § 139, ECHR 2011) and Jaloud v. the Netherlands ([GC], no. 47708/08, § 139, ECHR 2014).

The Court refers to its case-law to the effect that the concept of ‘ jurisdiction ’ for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention must be considered to reflect the term ’ s meaning in public international law (see Gentilhomme and Others v. France, nos. 48205/99, 48207/99 and 48209/99, § 20, judgment of 14 May 2002; Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, §§ 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII; and Assanidze v.

                "This presumption may be limited in exceptional circumstances, particularly where a State is prevented from exercising its authority in part of its territory. That may be as a result of military occupation by the armed forces of another State which effectively controls the territory concerned (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), judgment of 23 March 1995, Series A no. 310, and Cyprus v. Turkey, §§ 76-80, cited above, and also cited in the above-mentioned Banković and Others decision, §§ 70 ‑ 71), acts of war or rebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the territory of the State concerned.",
                "313. In order to be able to conclude that such an exceptional situation exists, the Court must examine on the one hand all the objective facts capable of limiting the effective exercise of a State ’ s authority over its territory, and on the other the State ’ s own conduct. The undertakings given by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention include, in addition to the duty to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed, positive obligations to take appropriate steps to ensure respect for those rights and freedoms within its territory (see, among other authorities, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001-V).",

The Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the whole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set up, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its territory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.",
                "Nevertheless, such a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the State under Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State ’ s positive obligations towards persons within its territory. The State in question must endeavour, with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-à-vis foreign States and international organisations, to continue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention.",

                "“103. The Court has established a number of clear principles in its case-law under Article 1. Thus, as provided by this Article, the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State is confined to “securing” ( ‘ reconnaître ’ in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own “jurisdiction” (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 86, Series A no. 161; Banković and Others, cited above, § 66). “Jurisdiction” under Article 1 is a threshold criterion. The exercise of jurisdiction is a necessary condition for a Contracting State to be able to be held responsible for acts or omissions imputable to it which give rise to an allegation of the infringement of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 311, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 130 ).",
                "104. A State ’ s jurisdictional competence under Article 1 is primarily territorial (see Soering, cited above, § 86; Banković and Others, cited above, §§ 61-67; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 131). Jurisdiction is presumed to be exercised normally throughout the State ’ s territory (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 312, and Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 139, ECHR 2004-II). Conversely, acts of the Contracting States performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 only in exceptional cases (see Banković and Others, cited above, § 67, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 131).",
                "105. To date, the Court has recognised a number of exceptional circumstances capable of giving rise to the exercise of jurisdiction by a Contracting State outside its own territorial boundaries. In each case, the question whether exceptional circumstances exist which require and justify a finding by the Court that the State was exercising jurisdiction extraterritorially must be determined with reference to the particular facts (see Al ‑ Skeini and Others, cited above, § 132).",
                "106. One exception to the principle that jurisdiction under Article 1 is limited to a State ’ s own territory occurs when, as a consequence of lawful or unlawful military action, a Contracting State exercises effective control of an area outside that national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State ’ s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration ( see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 62, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 76, ECHR 2001-IV; Banković and Others, cited above, § 70; Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 314-16; Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138). Where the fact of such domination over the territory is established, it is not necessary to determine whether the Contracting State exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration. The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the Contracting State ’ s military and other support entails that State ’ s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, §§ 76-77, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 138).",
                "107. It is a question of fact whether a Contracting State exercises effective control over an area outside its own territory. In determining whether effective control exists, the Court will primarily have reference to the strength of the State ’ s military presence in the area (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, §§ 16 and 56, and Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 387). Other indicators may also be relevant, such as the extent to which its military, economic and political support for the local subordinate administration provides it with influence and control over the region (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, §§ 388-94, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, § 139).",

Serbia and Montenegro ... The Court notes that in the judgment relied upon by the Russian Government, the International Court of Justice was concerned with determining when the conduct of a person or group of persons could be attributed to a State, so that the State could be held responsible under international law in respect of that conduct.

Nevertheless, in Ilaşcu and Others (cited above), the Court held that individuals detained in Transdniestria fell within Moldova ’ s jurisdiction because it was the territorial State, even though it did not have effective control over the Transdniestrian region. Moldova ’ s obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the [Convention] rights and freedoms”, was, however, limited in the circumstances to a positive obligation to take the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with international law (ibid., § 331).

In his view, there had been frequent incidents of corruption and abuse of criminal procedures for private business interests, and his own case provided an example.

While Turkey recognised the “TRNC” as an independent State, Russia did not recognise the “MRT” and, as was clear from the Russian Government ’ s observations in respect of jurisdiction in the present case, continued to consider the “MRT” as part of the Republic of Moldova. Secondly, Moldova had established a parallel system of courts for the Transdniestrian region. The task of these courts, located on the territory controlled by Moldova, was to examine civil and criminal cases relating to the Transdniestrian region. Any recognition by the Court that the “MRT courts” could be regarded as “tribunals established by law” or that they could impose “lawful” detention would undermine the functioning of these legitimate Moldovan courts. Thirdly, in contrast to the situation in the “TRNC”, the “MRT courts” did not apply the laws of the Republic of Moldova or the laws of the Russian Federation, but rather their own legal system, which was not compatible with Convention standards."

It drew inspiration, inter alia, from the stance of the ICJ in Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa), notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1971, § 125). In that Advisory Opinion, the ICJ had found that, while official acts performed by the government of South Africa on behalf of or concerning Namibia after the termination of the mandate were illegal and invalid, this invalidity could not be extended to those acts such as, for instance, the registration of births, deaths or marriages, the effects of which could be ignored only to the detriment of the inhabitants of that territory. The Court found that use should be made of remedies available in the “TRNC” provided that it could be shown that they existed to the advantage of individuals and offered them reasonable prospects of success. On a more general level it noted that the absence of courts in the “TRNC” would work to the detriment of the members of the Greek-Cypriot community. The Court then concluded as follows.",

That life must be made tolerable and be protected by the de facto authorities, including their courts; and, in the very interest of the inhabitants, the acts of these authorities related thereto cannot be simply ignored by third States or by international institutions, especially courts, including this one.

It went on to say that it would not be consistent with such responsibility under the Convention if the adoption by the authorities of the “TRNC” of civil, administrative or criminal-law measures, or their application or enforcement within their territory, were to be denied any validity or regarded as having no “lawful” basis in terms of the Convention.

The Commission found support for this view in the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Namibia case ... Moreover, in the Commission ’ s opinion due weight had to be given to the fact that the civil courts operating in the ‘ TRNC ’ were in substance based on the Anglo-Saxon tradition and were not essentially different from the courts operating before the events of 1974 and from those which existed in the southern part of Cyprus.",

As the Commission observed, the court system in its functioning and procedures reflects the judicial and common-law tradition of Cyprus (see paragraph 231 above). In its opinion, having regard to the fact that it is the ‘ TRNC domestic law ’ which defines the substance of those rights and obligations for the benefit of the population as a whole it must follow that the domestic courts, set up by the ‘ law ’ of the ‘ TRNC ’, are the fora for their enforcement. For the Court, and for the purposes of adjudicating on ‘ civil rights and obligations ’ the local courts can be considered to be ‘ established by law ’ with reference to the ‘ constitutional and legal basis ’ on which they operate.",

It is insufficient to declare that the Convention rights are protected on a certain territory – the Court must be satisfied that such protection is also effective.

It therefore finds that the “MRT courts” and, by implication, any other “MRT authority”, could not order the applicant ’ s “lawful arrest or detention” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s detention based on the orders of the “MRT courts” was unlawful for the purposes of that provision.",

The Court must next determine whether the Republic of Moldova fulfilled its positive obligations to take appropriate and sufficient measures to secure the applicant ’ s rights under Article 5 § 1 (see paragraph 100 above). In Ilaşcu and Others (cited above, §§ 339-40), the Court held that Moldova ’ s positive obligations related both to measures needed to re-establish its control over the Transdniestrian territory, as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to measures to ensure respect for individual applicants ’ rights. The obligation to re-establish control over Transdniestria required Moldova to refrain from supporting the separatist regime and to act by taking all the political, judicial and other measures at its disposal for re ‑ establishing control over the territory. The Court took the same approach in Catan and Others (cited above, § 145)."

As regards the first aspect of Moldova ’ s positive obligation, to re-establish control, the Court found in Ilaşcu and Others (cited above, §§ 341 ‑ 45) that from the onset of the hostilities in 1991-92 until July 2004, when judgment was given, Moldova had taken all the measures in its power to re-establish control over Transdniestrian territory. The Court found no reason to depart from that finding in Catan and Others (cited above, § 146). In the present case, the parties did not submit any new argument on the issue. There is nothing to indicate that the Moldovan Government changed their position in respect of Transdniestria in the intervening years up to the period of the applicant ’ s detention from November 2008 to July 2010. The Court therefore sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

Turning to the second aspect of the positive obligation, namely to ensure respect for the applicants ’ rights, the Court found in Ilaşcu and Others (cited above, §§ 348-52) that Moldova had failed to comply fully with its positive obligations to the extent that from May 2001 it had failed to take all the measures available to it in the course of negotiations with the “MRT” and Russian authorities to bring an end to the violation of the applicants ’ rights. In the present case, however, the Court considers that the Moldovan Government made considerable efforts to support the applicant. In particular, the authorities made a number of appeals to various intergovernmental organisations and foreign countries, notably Russia, asking them to assist in securing the applicant ’ s rights (see paragraph 51 above). When the applicant asked the Moldovan Supreme Court of Justice to quash his conviction, he obtained such a decision (see paragraph 26 above) and the prosecutor ’ s office did eventually take whatever steps it could to investigate the applicant ’ s allegations relating to his unlawful detention (see paragraphs 52 - 53 above)."

Considering the number of complaints concerning breaches of Convention rights by the “MRT” authorities and the inevitable delay in dealing with all of them at a high diplomatic level, the Court cannot conclude that the initial lack of reaction amounts, by itself, to a failure by Moldova to take whatever steps it could in order to secure the applicant ’ s rights."

Accordingly, the responsibility of Contracting States can be involved by acts and omissions of their authorities which produce effects outside their own territory. Of particular significance to the present case the Court held, in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, that the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action - whether lawful or unlawful - it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see the above-mentioned Loizidou judgment (preliminary objections), ibid.)."

The limited ambit of this finding of \"control\" must be seen in the light of the Commission ’ s characterisation of the applicant ’ s complaint as essentially concerning freedom of movement across the buffer-zone (see paragraphs 59 and 61 below).

Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC\" (see paragraph 52 above).

In this connection it is relevant to recall that, following violent demonstrations in the United Nations buffer-zone in November 1988, the Government of Cyprus had given assurances that it would in future do whatever was necessary to ensure respect for the buffer-zone ... Accordingly, UNFICYP asked the Government to take effective action to prevent any demonstrators from entering the buffer-zone, bearing in mind that such entry would lead to a situation that might be difficult to control. The demonstration took place on 19 March 1989. An estimated 2,000 women crossed the buffer-zone at Lymbia and some managed to cross the Turkish forces ’ line. A smaller group crossed that line at Akhna. At Lymbia, a large number of Turkish Cypriot women arrived shortly after the Greek Cypriots and mounted a counter demonstration, remaining however on their side of the line. Unarmed Turkish soldiers opposed the demonstrators and, thanks largely to the manner in which they and the Turkish Cypriot police dealt with the situation, the demonstration passed without serious incident. Altogether, 54 demonstrators were arrested by Turkish Cypriot police in the two locations; they were released to UNFICYP later the same day.\"",

She stressed that the rules of international law must be taken into account when interpreting the Convention and contended that the 1985 Constitution of the \"TRNC\" was - as was recognised by the international community - invalid under international law, because its origin lay in the illegal use of force by Turkey. A second reason was that the policy of the Turkish authorities was based upon racial discrimination in breach of Article 14 of the Convention (art. 14) and of customary international law.

Evidence for this contention was provided by the Settlement and Distribution of Land and Property of Equivalent Value Law of 28 August 1995 which, according to the Government, purports to extend what were hitherto limited permits to occupy Greek property and by the fact that Turkey alleged that there had been no confiscation of Greek property in northern Cyprus in a memorial circulated within the Committee of Ministers in 1987."

That particularity entailed that, in order to determine whether Turkey is responsible for the alleged violation of her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) with respect to her possessions in northern Cyprus, the Court should take into account the principles of State responsibility under international law. In this context Mrs Loizidou repeated her criticism that the Commission had focused too much on the direct involvement of Turkish officials in the impugned continuous denial of access. Whilst evidence of direct involvement of Turkish officials in violations of the Convention is relevant, it is not a legal condition of responsibility under public international law.",

This was the legal position whether the local administration is illegal, in that it is the consequence of an illegal use of force, or whether it is lawful, as in the case of a protected State or other dependency. A State cannot by delegation avoid responsibility for breaches of its duties under international law, especially not for breaches of its duties under the Convention which, as illustrated by the wording of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1), involve a guarantee to secure Convention rights.",

Since the Republic of Cyprus obviously cannot be held accountable for the part of the island occupied by Turkey, it must be Turkey which is so accountable. Otherwise the northern part of Cyprus would constitute a vacuum as regards responsibility for violations of human rights, the acceptance of which would be contrary to the principle of effectiveness which underlies the Convention. In any case there is overwhelming evidence that Turkey has effective overall control over events in the occupied area. She added that the fact that the Court, at the preliminary objections phase of the present case, had found Turkey to have jurisdiction created a strong presumption of Turkish responsibility for violations occurring in the occupied area."

In the second place, the presumption of control and responsibility argued for by the applicants was rebuttable. In this respect it was highly significant that the Commission in the Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou v. Turkey report of 8 July 1993 found that the applicants ’ arrest, detention and trial in northern Cyprus were not \"acts\" imputable to Turkey. Moreover, the Commission found no indication of control exercised by the Turkish authorities over the prison administration or the administration of justice by Turkish Cypriot authorities in the applicant ’ s case (cited above at paragraph 32).",

Article 1 (art. 1) was not couched in terms of State responsibility. In their submission this provision (art. 1) required proof that the act complained of was actually committed by an authority of the defendant State or occurred under its direct control and that this authority at the time of the alleged violation exercised effective jurisdiction over the applicant.",

Moreover, the Turkish forces in northern Cyprus are there for the protection of the Turkish Cypriots and with the consent of the ruling authority of the \"TRNC\". Neither the Turkish forces nor the Turkish Government in any way exercise governmental authority in northern Cyprus.

Accordingly, the responsibility of Contracting States can be involved by acts and omissions of their authorities which produce effects outside their own territory. Of particular significance to the present case the Court held, in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, that the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action - whether lawful or unlawful - it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see the above-mentioned Loizidou judgment (preliminary objections), ibid.)."

Although it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 § 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should review whether this law has been complied with (see, among many other authorities, Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 41, Reports 1996 ‑ III and Assanidze v. Georgia, cited above, § 171). A period of detention is, in principle, “lawful” if it is based on a court order.

It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, ECHR 2008 ‑ I )."

However, the Court is not assessing the responsibility of Greece for the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 (f), but the responsibility of Moldova for that detention, that is the international arrest warrant issued by Interpol at the request of the Moldovan authorities for the purpose of enforcing the detention order of 19 June 2009. As indicated above, the applicant takes issue only with the lawfulness of the detention order which was at the origin of her deprivation of liberty in Greece, that is with the lawfulness of the detention order issued by the Botanica District Court on 19 June 2009. It is without doubt that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty in Greece was a direct consequence of that detention order and that no deprivation of liberty in Greece would have been possible in the absence of that order issued by the Moldovan courts. This fact was expressly noted by the Greek courts in their decisions concerning the applicant ’ s extradition, where they made specific reference to the Botanica District Court ’ s decision on 19 June 2009 (see paragraph 15 above)."

The Court therefore considers that the applicant ’ s detention in Greece, although formally for the purpose of her extradition, was part of the mechanism used by the Moldovan authorities to implement the Botanica District Court ’ s decision of 19 June 2009 outside Moldova ’ s borders and to bring the applicant before a competent Moldovan legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. Therefore, as regards Moldova, the applicant ’ s detention is to be examined under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. In reaching this conclusion the Court bears in mind the principle according to which “[t]he Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective” (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32). Had it been otherwise, the applicant would remain without the protection of Article 5 of the Convention."

The Court notes that the reason for ordering the applicant ’ s detention relied upon by the Moldovan courts was the fact that she had failed to appear before the investigating authorities when summoned (see paragraph 12). In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant left the country lawfully at a time when no criminal proceedings were pending against her. It was after her leaving the country that the authorities initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant. The Court further notes the applicant ’ s submission, which the Government did not contest, that she had given the police her contact information in Greece at a meeting with them after the events of 15 September 2008. In spite of that, the prosecutors issued the summons to her Moldovan address in Causeni. Moreover, according to the material in the case-file, the prosecutors contacted the applicant ’ s adult son and a relative of hers but failed to ask them to inform the applicant that she had to appear before them and made no attempt to follow up the information that she was in Greece. In fact, the case-file material does not contain any evidence to the effect that the authorities made any reasonable attempts to inform the applicant of the criminal proceedings and the necessity to appear before them within the framework of those proceedings."

                "40. The Court considers that where such an important issue as the right to liberty is at stake, it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to convincingly demonstrate that detention was necessary. Where the authorities order the detention of an individual pending trial on the grounds of his or her failure to appear before them when summoned, they should make sure that the individual in question had been given adequate notice and sufficient time to comply and take reasonable steps to verify that he or she has in fact absconded. That was certainly not the case in the present case where the authorities chose to take a very formalistic approach to the problem of summoning the applicant and when the applicant did not show up they hastily concluded that she was absconding. The Court notes that this appears to be contrary to Article 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states in clear terms that detention pending trial can be imposed only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect could abscond from the investigating authorities (see paragraphs 17 above). It also appears to be contrary to Article 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states that if the person to be summoned declared another address during the proceedings, then the summons shall be sent to that address (see paragraph 18 above)."

The refusal of the domestic courts to check the applicant ’ s submissions about improper summoning and to give her a chance to appear before the authorities has persuaded the Court that the applicant ’ s detention cannot be considered necessary and devoid of arbitrariness under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention (compare to Ladent v. Poland, no. 11036/03, § 56, 18 March 2008). There has therefore been a breach of Article 5 § 1.",

The Court reiterates that absolving the Contracting States completely from their Convention responsibility where they were simply complying with their obligations as members of an international organisation to which they had transferred a part of their sovereignty would be incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention: the guarantees of the Convention could be limited or excluded at will, thereby depriving it of its peremptory character and undermining the practical and effective nature of its safeguards. In other words, the States remain responsible under the Convention for the measures they take to comply with their international legal obligations, even when those obligations stem from their membership of an international organisation to which they have transferred part of their sovereignty (see Bosphorus, cited above, § 154)."

In addition, any such presumption can be rebutted if, in the circumstances of a particular case, it is considered that the protection of Convention rights was manifestly deficient. In such cases, the interest of international cooperation would be outweighed by the Convention’s role as a “constitutional instrument of European public order” in the field of human rights (see Bosphorus, cited above, §§ 152-58, and also, among other authorities, M.S.S. v.

It also serves to determine in which cases the Court may, in the interests of international cooperation, reduce the intensity of its supervisory role, as conferred on it by Article 19 of the Convention, with regard to observance by the States Parties of their engagements arising from the Convention. It follows from these aims that the Court will accept such an arrangement only where the rights and safeguards it protects are given protection comparable to that afforded by the Court itself.

It concluded that the right to a fair trial enshrined, inter alia, in Article 6 of the Convention was a fundamental right which the European Union respected as a general principle by virtue of Article 6 § 2 of the Treaty on European Union.",

It pointed out that as a general rule these activities, by their very nature, took place in contexts that were not related to any judicial proceedings and therefore did not concern the right to a fair trial.",

It considered that this exemption protected the client’s right to a fair trial. It also stated that the requirements relating to the right to a fair trial did not preclude the obligations of information and cooperation from being imposed on lawyers acting specifically in the situations listed in the preceding paragraph where those obligations were “justified by the need ... to combat money-laundering effectively, in view of its evident influence on the rise of organised crime, which itself [was] a particular threat to society in the member States”.",

It further notes that, like the obligation to show due diligence and report suspicions, it affects all French lawyers, so the applicant belongs to a class of people who risk being directly affected by it. In particular, for example, if he fails to report suspicious activities as required he will expose himself by virtue of this text to disciplinary sanctions up to and including being struck off. The Court also considers credible the applicant’s suggestion that, as a lawyer specialising in financial and tax law, he is even more concerned by these obligations than many of his colleagues and exposed to the consequences of failure to comply. In fact he is faced with a dilemma comparable, mutatis mutandis, to that which the Court identified in Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (22 October 1981, § 41, Series A no. 45) and Norris (cited above, §§ 30-34): either he applies the rules and relinquishes his idea of the principle of lawyer-client privilege, or he decides not to apply them and exposes himself to disciplinary sanctions and even being struck off."

France judgment (no. 18603/03, 24 July 2008). He added that to require lawyers to report their suspicions meant that they were expected to divulge personal information about their clients – which fell within the scope of Article 8 –, and that prohibiting them from informing the person they were reporting deprived that person not only of the right to receive information but also of the possibility of correcting it or having it deleted if the suspicion proved to be unfounded.

He had reached that conclusion after observing that 98% of the nominal information lawyers were obliged to report was used for that purpose rather than to prevent crime. He referred in this connection to the statistics published by the FIU, which revealed, for example, that in 2010 it had received 20,252 reports, including 19,208 reports of suspicions submitted by the legal profession, that only 5,132 of these – that is, 25% – had been examined in detail and that in the end only 404 (no more than a quarter of which concerned suspicions of money-laundering) had been forwarded to the judicial system for follow-up; the others had been dealt with in the form of notes for the intelligence services, the tax authorities and the police. The information thus gathered was transmitted, recorded and held by an administrative department answering to the Ministry of Finance and it was not known what use was made of it. These figures also showed how inefficient the system was, as only 404 out of 19,208 reports had found their way into the justice system; lawyer-client privilege was thus being sacrificed to very little effect in terms of the prevention of money-laundering."

In asking the member States to “ensure” that money-laundering was prohibited, Article 2 of Directive 2001/97/EC allowed them to have recourse to a whole range of methods which were proportionate and tailored to the situation of each of the professions concerned. Obliging lawyers to report suspicions was clearly unnecessary when they were already subject to the criminal legislation prohibiting money-laundering, to strict legal obligations and to close financial scrutiny. French criminal law severely punished money-laundering and a lawyer could be charged with aiding and abetting if he neglected to dissuade a client from engaging in a dubious financial transaction, and cash transactions were prohibited in the profession."

In particular, the notion of reporting “suspicions” was unambiguous: the suspicions could concern the identity of the client or the beneficiary of the operation, the origin of the funds, the unusual or complex nature of the transaction or its purpose; under Article L. 561-15 of the Monetary and Financial Code suspicions had to be reported when the professional knew, based on clear, objective information, that the funds were the proceeds of crime, or when the characteristics of the operation or the lack of details or missing information he was unable to obtain gave rise to suspicions of money-laundering and constituted reasonable grounds to doubt the legitimate origin of the funds. In addition, Article D. 561-32-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code laid down the reference criteria that should trigger reports of suspicions of tax fraud – the use of front companies, for example – because they were an indication of dubious practices. As to the notion of “legal advice”, the Government considered that no lawyer could seriously be unaware of its meaning, especially as it was clearly defined in both legal theory and case-law as well as by the General Assembly of the Bar Council (which, in a resolution adopted on 18 June 2011, defined it as “a personalised intellectual service consisting, on a given question, of offering an opinion or advice on the application of a rule of law with a view, for example, to the taking of a decision”).

They further submitted that professional confidentiality was given specific protection under European Union law, referring in that regard to the AM & S Europe Limited v. Commission of the European Communities judgment of 18 May 1982, in which the Court of Justice had noted that “there are to be found in the national laws of the member States common criteria inasmuch as those laws protect, in similar circumstances, the confidentiality of written communications between lawyer and client provided that, on the one hand, such communications are made for the purposes and in the interests of the client’s rights of defence and, on the other hand, they emanate from independent lawyers, that is to say, lawyers who are not bound to the client by a relationship of employment”.

Lawyers were not affected in their activities linked to judicial proceedings or when consulted for “legal advice”. The only cases where this exception did not apply were where the legal counsellor himself was taking part in money-laundering activities, the legal advice was provided for money-laundering purposes, or the lawyer knew that the client was seeking legal advice for money-laundering purposes.",

Only a small number of other European Union member States had taken up that option (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Portugal and Spain), so French law was among the most protective of legal professional privilege in the European Union.",

The obligation to report suspicions required lawyers to make their clients incriminate themselves. Secondly, as the legal provisions in issue were based on the notion of “suspicions”, but did not define that term, the “law” had neither the quality nor the foreseeability required. Thirdly, confidentiality was particularly important in the Court’s case-law – which protected the confidentiality of journalists’ sources and of medical data –, the protection of legal professional privilege in the face of this type of obligation had been affirmed in Canada and the United States of America, and the positive law of certain European Union member States (Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands), as well as Switzerland, was more protective. Fourthly, as the Court had pointed out in the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment (24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A), the lawyer played a key role in preserving public confidence in the action of the courts; it was essential, therefore, that people should be able to trust in their lawyers, which meant preserving their independence from the authorities – which was undermined by the link with the FIU established by the legal provisions in issue – and the confidentiality of the information they handled.",
                "The interference also had to be proportionate to the aim pursued: the fight against money-laundering and terrorism. However, whereas the Court had found in the Xavier Da Silveira v. France case (no. 43757/05, 21 January 2010) that special procedural guarantees were needed in that particular case, which concerned searches or visits to a lawyer’s offices, the provisions in issue in the present case provided no such guarantees (the part played by the Chairman of the Bar was limited to an advisory role where he was certain that there was nothing suspicious to report). In addition, French lawyers were all subject to the criminal law on money-laundering, which was particularly strict, as well as to major ethical obligations, with sanctions for failure to comply, and to financial supervision. They were not allowed to handle cash transactions, except for very small sums, and bank transfers had to be made through a special payment fund for lawyers."

                "89. Lastly, on the subject of the presumption of equivalent protection, EBHRI pointed out that the Bosphorus case concerned the obligation for the respondent State to apply a Community Regulation implementing the obligations arising from a binding resolution of the United Nations Security Council. Thus far the cases in which the Court had allowed equivalent protection in favour of the European Union had not concerned the implementation of Directives, which, unlike Regulations, left the States a margin of appreciation. Furthermore, while the fact that certain of the Directives relating to money-laundering referred to the Convention might lead to the acknowledgment of an equivalence of the rules and the substantive protection, there was clearly no equivalence of procedural protection in the absence of a right of individual petition in the European Union system. EBHRI also noted that the Court had acknowledged the equivalence of the protection afforded in the case of disputes involving international organisation staff members, precisely because they had a right of direct individual application to a judicial body affording all the requisite guarantees (it referred to Boivin v. 34 member States of the Council of Europe (dec.), no. 73250/01, ECHR 2008; Gasparini v. Italy and Belgium (dec.), no. 10750/03, 12 May 2009; and Beygo v. 46 member States of the Council of Europe, no. 36099/06, 16 June 2009).",

So, in requiring lawyers to report to the administrative authorities information concerning another person which came into their possession through exchanges with that person, the obligation for them to report suspicions constitutes an interference with lawyers’ right to respect for their correspondence. It also constitutes an interference with their right to respect for their “private life”, a notion which includes activities of a professional or business nature (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251 ‑ B)."

However, as indicated previously, he is faced with the following dilemma: either he does as he is told and in so doing abandons his idea of the principle of the confidentiality of exchanges between lawyer and client and of legal professional privilege; or he refuses to comply and exposes himself to disciplinary sanctions and even being struck off. In the opinion of the Court, therefore, the obligation to report suspicions amounts to a “continuing interference” (see, mutatis mutandis, Dudgeon, § 41, and Norris, § 38, both cited above) with the applicant’s enjoyment, as a lawyer, of the rights guaranteed by Article 8, even if it is not the most intimate sphere of his private life that is affected but his right to respect for his professional exchanges with his clients."

Such is undeniably the case here: the obligation for lawyers to report suspicions is provided for in European Directives which have been transposed into French law (in particular Law no. 2004-130 of 11 February 2004 in the case of the Directive of 10 June 1991, as amended) and codified in the Monetary and Financial Code; the practical formalities are set forth in implementing regulations (the provisions of which are also codified) and also in the decision of the National Bar Council of 12 July 2007 cited above."

However, the Court has already recognised the impossibility of attaining absolute certainty in the framing of laws and the risk that the search for certainty may entail excessive rigidity. Many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (ibid.)."

                "As to the allegedly vague nature of the type of activity concerned by the obligation to report suspicions, the Court notes that the texts in issue (for example Article 1 of the National Bar Council’s decision of 12 July 2007, see paragraph 12 above) state that the obligation applies to lawyers when, in the course of their business activity, they participate for and on behalf of their client in any financial or real-estate transaction or assist their client in the preparation or execution of certain types of transaction (relating to the buying and selling of real estate or businesses, the management of funds, securities or other assets belonging to the client, the opening of current accounts, savings accounts or securities accounts, the organisation of the contributions required to create companies, the formation, administration or management of companies, or the formation, administration or management of trusts governed by a foreign legal system, or of any other similar structure). The texts specify that they are not bound by the same rules when acting as legal counsel or in the context of judicial proceedings in connection with one or other of the above activities.

It also serves to determine in which cases the Court may, in the interests of international cooperation, reduce the intensity of its supervisory role, as conferred on it by Article 19 of the Convention, with regard to observance by the States Parties of their engagements arising from the Convention.

            [
                "124. As to the applicant’s argument that the obligation to report is not necessary because any lawyer found to be involved in a money-laundering operation would in any event be liable to criminal proceedings, the Court is not indifferent to it. It considers, however, that that argument does not prevent a State or a group of States from combining the repressive provisions they have adopted with a specifically preventive mechanism."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court also takes note of the statistics published by the FIU to which the applicant referred, in particular the fact that out of the 20,252 reports received by the FIU in 2010, including 19,208 reports of suspicions submitted by professionals, only 5,132 were examined in detail and only 404 were forwarded to the prosecuting authorities, and approximately only a hundred of those concerned money-laundering or terrorist financing. The applicant maintained that these figures showed that the system was ineffective and the interference therefore unnecessary. The Court is not convinced. It fails to see what lesson can be learnt from these figures in the present case when the FIU’s 2010 activity report reveals that none of the 19,208 reports of suspicions were submitted by a lawyer. It considers, on the contrary, that this report presents a positive picture of the results achieved; in fact FATF found that France’s methods of combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism were among the most effective in the world. It further observes that the applicant’s argument ignores the deterrent effect of the system."
            ],
            [
                "126. Lastly, and above all, two factors are decisive in the eyes of the Court in assessing the proportionality of the interference."
            ],
            [
                "127. Firstly, as stated above and as the Conseil d’Etat noted, the fact that lawyers are subject to the obligation to report suspicions only in two cases: where, in the context of their business activity, they take part for and on behalf of their clients in financial or real-estate transactions or act as trustees; and where they assist their clients in preparing or carrying out transactions concerning certain defined operations (the buying and selling of real estate or businesses; the management of funds, securities or other assets belonging to the client; the opening of current accounts, savings accounts, securities accounts or insurance policies; the organisation of the contributions required to create companies; the formation, administration or management of companies; the formation, administration or management of trusts or any other similar structure; and the setting-up or management of endowment funds). The obligation to report suspicions therefore only concerns tasks performed by lawyers, which are similar to those performed by the other professions subjected to the same obligation, and not the role they play in defending their clients.",
                "Furthermore, the Monetary and Financial Code specifies that lawyers are not subjected to the obligation where the activity in question “relates to judicial proceedings, whether the information they have was received or obtained before, during or after said proceedings, including any advice given with regard to the manner of initiating or avoiding such proceedings, nor where they give legal advice, unless said information was provided for the purpose of money-laundering or terrorist financing or with the knowledge that the client requested it for the purpose of money-laundering or terrorist financing” (Article L. 561-3 II of the Monetary and Financial Code, see paragraph 32 above)."
            ],
            [
                "128. The obligation to report suspicions does not therefore go to the very essence of the lawyer’s defence role which, as stated earlier, forms the very basis of legal professional privilege."
            ],
            [
                "129. The second factor is that the legislation has introduced a filter which protects professional privilege: lawyers do not transmit reports directly to the FIU but, as appropriate, to the President of the Bar Council of the Conseil d’Etat and the Court of Cassation or to the Chairman of the Bar of which the lawyer is a member. It can be considered that at this stage, when a lawyer shares information with a fellow professional who is not only subject to the same rules of conduct but also elected by his or her peers to uphold them, professional privilege has not been breached. The fellow professional concerned, who is better placed than anybody to determine which information is covered by lawyer-client privilege and which is not, transmits the report of suspicions to the FIU only after having ascertained that the conditions laid down by Article L. 561-3 of the Monetary and Financial Code have been met (Article L. 561-17 of the same Code, see paragraph 38 above). The Government pointed out in this regard that the information is not forwarded if the Chairman of the Bar considers that there is no suspicion of money-laundering or it appears that the information reported was received in the course of activities excluded from the scope of the obligation to report suspicions."

It could no doubt have sought to be admitted as an \"associate member\" of the organisation under Article 5 of the Statute; if its application had been accepted by the Committee of Ministers, it would have had the right, as Saarland had in 1950, to sign and ratify the Convention. But it appears never to have taken any steps to do this.",

This method of permanent consultation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The tripartite commission has met nine times since April 1991, at the House of the Valleys in Andorra. Its work, which has invariably been constructive, has made it possible to avoid misunderstandings and overcome all sorts of difficulties.",

Every innovative work, especially in the political field, is accompanied by hopes and fears, and arouses the necessary democratic debate, as well as legitimate ambitions and fervent personal commitment.",

Mountain-dwellers like you know how to save their breath and measure their step according to the length or difficulty of the ascent. You are experienced men, patient men. You know, and you do not need me to tell you, that once the way to the summit has been decided on by common consent, there is no choice other than to succeed or fail together.",

I cannot encourage you too much to continue with your task, certain as I am that you will know how to legislate, govern, administer, give justice and in short assume full responsibility for the Principality, which will soon be completely devolved to you.",
                "You will doubtless, at least to start with, have to act with boldness, but also with care to preserve the richness of your traditions and the identity of the parishes which originally joined together to form Andorra.",
                "In this task, on which considerable progress has now been made, I am with you so that social justice may prevail, for without that there can be no true economic progress, and so that the elected representatives of Andorra may exercise fully the internal sovereignty of Andorra, without which there can be no international recognition.",
                "France and no doubt Spain, as your neighbours, will surely be the first to establish relations of friendship and co- operation with the future State of Andorra.",
                "The signing of the association agreement between the EEC and Andorra was the first step towards the integration of the Principality into the European Economic Area. Other steps will follow. The interest shown by you in particular in the regulation of the banking profession and the control of international flows of money demonstrates your concern not to stay apart from the new forms of solidarity which are coming into being so that law and fairness can prevail in the international order.",

Your freedom, given expression in elections, will strengthen your traditions and allow your country to join the international community while still affirming the power of its special features, its history and culture.",

You will be so kind as to pass the essence of it on to the people of Andorra, so now we have a few moments left in which to stay together and improve our mutual acquaintance, passing some time in the useful, fruitful and friendly way which our relationship demands.\" (French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bulletin d ’ information of 27 November 1991 (231/91))",

He complained that he had not received the assistance of an interpreter or a lawyer during the investigation, nor a complete translation during the trial (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above).",

It could no doubt have sought to be admitted as an \"associate member\" of the organisation under Article 5 of the Statute; if its application had been accepted by the Committee of Ministers, it would have had the right, as Saarland had in 1950, to sign and ratify the Convention.

However, they made certain observations with respect to them. They were in a minority, as the batlles were Andorran citizens, and they invariably acquired Andorran nationality when taking up their office and lost it at the end of their service. If they were still serving judges, the Ministry of Justice placed them at the disposal of the French Co-Prince, who then proceeded to appoint them. More generally, the practice of seconding officials belonged to a long French tradition of judicial cooperation - in particular with Monaco and with African States - and of the independence of the judges in question with respect to their country of origin. Moreover, the Higher Court of Perpignan (see paragraph 66 above) was not a de facto French civil court, as it had a different composition from that of a French court and did not apply French law or follow French procedure.",
                "On the second point, the Government stated that the French courts had no direct or indirect power of supervision over judgments and decisions given in the Principality. They conceded, however, that different views had been taken in the case-law as regards the legal analysis of relations between France and Andorra with respect to jurisdiction. Thus the first civil division of the Court of Cassation had held that the formality of an exequatur was not needed for the enforcement of Andorran judgments in France (decisions of 6 January 1971, Elsen et autre c. Consorts Bouillot and c. Boudet, Bulletin civil [Bull.] 1971, I, no. 2, pp. 1-2; decision of 8 February 1977, Boudet c. compagnie Le Patrimoine et autre, Bull. 1977, I, no. 69, pp. 55-56).

The Government argued that a distinction should be drawn between the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the lawfulness of the conviction from the point of view of Article 6 (art. 6); the former could be assessed only by reference to the internal law of the country of detention. If the authorities of that country were obliged to assure themselves of the latter, in the case of a trial which had taken place abroad, the result would be to make the transfer of prisoners extremely difficult, or even impossible. It would also have a paradoxical effect, in that, as it would not be possible to retry the defendant in the receiving country, it would have to be left to the country which had been found responsible for breaching the Convention to enforce the sentence itself. Besides, the Principality would itself have to accommodate the prisoners who are now in France and Spain, and would thus have to provide itself with the appropriate institutions and personnel.",

The Court, like the Commission, considers that in this case the Tribunal de Corts, which pronounced the conviction of Mr Drozd and Mr Janousek, is the \"competent court\" referred to in Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a). As the Convention does not require the Contracting Parties to impose its standards on third States or territories, France was not obliged to verify whether the proceedings which resulted in the conviction were compatible with all the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. To require such a review of the manner in which a court not bound by the Convention had applied the principles enshrined in Article 6 (art. 6) would also thwart the current trend towards strengthening international cooperation in the administration of justice, a trend which is in principle in the interests of the persons concerned. The Contracting States are, however, obliged to refuse their co-operation if it emerges that the conviction is the result of a flagrant denial of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 45, para. 113).",

It finds confirmation of this assurance in the decisions of some French courts: certain indictments divisions refuse to allow extradition of a person who has been convicted in his absence in a country where it is not possible for him to be retried on surrendering to justice (see, for example, the decision of the Limoges Court of Appeal, 15 May 1979, cited in the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 10, para. 18), and the Conseil d ’ État has declared the extradition of persons liable to the death penalty on the territory of the requesting State to be incompatible with French public policy (see, for instance, the Fidan judgment of 27 February 1987, with submissions by Government Commissioner Jean-Claude Bonichot, Recueil Dalloz Sirey 1987, jurisprudence, pp. 305-310, and the Gacem judgment of 14 December 1987, Recueil Lebon 1987, tables, p. 733).",

The respondent Government have not argued that the investigation into the death of the applicant ’ s husband did not attract Lithuania ’ s responsibility because he died when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’ (see paragraph 19 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § § 243-247, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert, V. A. during the hearing in April 200 8 before the Klaipėda Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 49 below). On the basis of V.B. ’ s medical record of 15 June 2001 that expert had testified that V.B. had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract. If the nerve did not work properly, heart arrhythmia could occur, which could in turn cause a heart attack. The position of V.B. ’ s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack. According to that expert, fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space, and there had been a lack of oxygen. However, a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation. Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take a day or week to happen.",

Furthermore, as could be seen from the SLI ’ s report of 27 March 2008, the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either (see paragraph 1 7 above). Accordingly, it could not be stated that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death had been performed thoroughly. In the opinion of the Klaipėda Regional Court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of V.B. ’ s body, and to establish whether V.B. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. Should breaches of working conditions be established, it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on V.B. ’ s death.

The Code also stipulated that an investigating officer or prosecutor had the right to order individuals or legal entities to provide objects or documents of relevance to a criminal investigation (Article 97). The victim of a crime could ask the prosecutor in writing to perform certain investigative actions and the prosecutor had to examine such a request.

The right of ownership of a ship sailing outside the territorial boundaries of the Republic of Lithuania was to be determined based on the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. The legal status of the ship ’ s crew was to be determined by the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. Relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain were to be determined by the legal acts of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under, unless an agreement regulating such relations provided otherwise. The provisions of civil, administrative, labour and other laws of the Republic of Lithuania applied accordingly to civil and administrative relations and those related to work on board ships and other legal relations arising from maritime shipping and not falling within the sphere of regulation of the Law in question (Article 5 §§ 1, 4, 5 and 17). The right to sail under the State flag of Lithuania was to be granted to ships which were entered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania (Article 7). A ship was to be registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania if its owner was a Lithuanian citizen or legal entity registered in Lithuania (Article 8). A ship registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailing under a Lithuanian flag was considered to be a subject of the Republic of Lithuania ( laivas, įregistruotas Lietuvos Respublikos jūrų laivų registre ir plaukiojantis su Lietuvos valstybės vėliava, turi Lietuvos Respublikos nacionalinę priklausomybę ) (Article 9).",

Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above).

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility ( see Anguelova v.

In as much as different considerations apply in cases such as the present one, in which the death has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action, the standard against which the investigation ’ s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting. However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness ( see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 73, 21 December 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In that regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Emars v. Latvia, no. 22412/08, § 76, 1 8 November 2014; Mulini v. Bulgaria, no. 2092/08, § 42, 20 October 2015 ), and that Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, §§ 94 and 96, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, § 51, 8 December 2015 ). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard (see Olszewscy v. Poland, no. 99/12, § 68, 3 November 2015 ). Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see Rantsev, cited above, § 232).",

In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding V.B. ’ s death and the allegations of fires and leaks of gases on the Vega in the period leading up to his death, the Court observes that a procedural obligation of effective criminal inquiry did arise in respect of the Lithuanian authorities to investigate the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 5 1 and 5 2 above). By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate circumstance of V.B. ’ s heart attack but also the broader context of V.B. ’ s working conditions on the Vega, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of hazardous working conditions and V.B. ’ s death."

Those proceedings terminated with the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s conclusion of 5 February 2009, dispelling the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 50 above). That being so, for the Court it is sufficient to note that on 20 March 2009, when the administrative court proceedings were already over, the Klaipėda Regional Court held that the criminal investigation as to the true cause of V.B. ’ s death had not been thorough. In fact, to dispel any remaining doubts, the prosecutor was ordered to continue the pre-trial investigation, and a number of investigative measures were conducted afterwards (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above)."

The following day, the Brazilian police took statements from the captain and the chief engineer (see paragraph 7 above). Aside from those actions, as the applicant rightly noted to the Lithuanian criminal court (see paragraph 2 1 above), her husband ’ s body was quickly embalmed the same day without her being asked whether she wished any further investigative actions to be taken. As a result, the experts could subsequently only discuss hypothetical possible causes for V.B. ’ s death, given that the lack of an autopsy prevented them from stating with certainty that he had died of a heart attack (see paragraphs 40-42 above). On this point the Court also notes that the ship ’ s captain performs the role of an investigative officer if a criminal act takes place on his ship (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst acknowledging that it was mostly not within the captain ’ s competence to decide what investigative measures the Brazilian authorities should have undertaken before embalming the body, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a heart attack as the cause of death was opportune in the face of the overall suspicions of hazardous work conditions on that ship. That being so, and whilst any possible failure to undertake investigative measures on 24 or 25 October 2007 on Brazilian territory is mostly not down to the Lithuanian ship ’ s captain and thus not down to the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph 53 above), it also transpires from the facts of the case that there were numerous deficiencies once the investigation into the circumstances of the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death was conducted in Lithuania."

The Court also observes that after the criminal case had been returned for further investigation, in 2009 the Klaipėda Seaport Police eventually asked the SLI to provide information on whether the Vega had been inspected. It is particularly striking to note the SLI ’ s answer that they had not inspected the ship after V.B. ’ s death, which had taken place nearly two years before (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Although the applicant strongly believed that her husband had not died of natural causes, but had been a victim of poisoning by combustion gases, and abundant evidence about those gases and fires on the ship had been brought to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities as early as in spring 2008 (see paragraphs 1 5-17 above ), the Lithuanian authorities made no effort to instruct the Limarko company to bring the ship back to Lithuania, where it could be properly examined, whereas Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to grant the prosecutor exactly that right (see paragraph 5 2 above). In that connection, the Court further notes that documents and medical experts have established, on the one hand, that the applicant ’ s husband was healthy, and that there were no obstacles to him serving on board a ship; on the other hand, those experts also concluded that in the absence of documents about the gases it was not possible to say that those gases were not the cause of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 19 in fine, 30 and 40 above)."

                "73. The Court further observes that on 10 September 2008 the applicant submitted a written request to the prosecutor to take particular actions to find out about the working conditions on the Vega at the material time. The prosecutor ignored her requests, which was recognised by the Klaipėda City District Court (see paragraph 2 2 above). Furthermore, although the applicant had as early as July 2009 alerted the prosecutor to the fact that Limarko intended to sell the Vega, and had asked the prosecutor to make sure that relevant documents would not be lost, her request again did not receive a timely response from the Lithuanian authorities. As a result, when half a year later the Klaipėda Seaport Police finally asked Limarko to submit documents regarding the Vega ’ s machinery section, the company confirmed that the ship had been sold to a third party, and the relevant logbooks had been destroyed (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 above). That being so, the Court finds that the Lithuanian authorities failed to secure all the relevant evidence, given the value of such evidence in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. The Court also considers that even if the applicant had been granted victim status at the beginning of the criminal investigation, her participation appears to have been limited to being able only to gain access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 12, 20 and 32 above). Accordingly, the Lithuanian authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite her constant and strenuous efforts to remain involved."

                "74. Finally, the Court turns to the question of legal assistance. It cannot but note that it took the Lithuanian authorities some eight months to prepare and send such a request to the Brazilian authorities (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). In any case, given that the request was sent more than three years after the death and after the opening of the pre-trial investigation, it is not astounding that no relevant information was received from the Brazilian authorities (see paragraph 38 above). That notwithstanding, the Court cannot but hold that the Lithuanian prosecutors once again simply accepted the lack of information as a fact, without considering whether it was necessary, for example, to submit another request for legal assistance to their Brazilian colleagues (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev, cited above, § 241). In this context the Court also is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument about difficulties in finding a translator from Portuguese language in Lithuania."

Those indications accordingly cannot, as such, serve here. Nevertheless, it remains true that the suffering occasioned must attain a particular level before a punishment can be classified as \"inhuman\" within the meaning of Article 3 (art. 3).

In fact, in most if not all cases this may be one of the effects of judicial punishment, involving as it does unwilling subjection to the demands of the penal system.",

It would be absurd to hold that judicial punishment generally, by reason of its usual and perhaps almost inevitable element of humiliation, is \"degrading\" within the meaning of Article 3 (art. 3). Some further criterion must be read into the text. Indeed, Article 3 (art. 3), by expressly prohibiting \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\" punishment, implies that there is a distinction between such punishment and punishment in general.",

As regards their belief that judicial corporal punishment deters criminals, it must be pointed out that a punishment does not lose its degrading character just because it is believed to be, or actually is, an effective deterrent or aid to crime control. Above all, as the Court must emphasise, it is never permissible to have recourse to punishments which are contrary to Article 3 (art. 3), whatever their deterrent effect may be.",

Furthermore, it is institutionalised violence that is in the present case violence permitted by the law, ordered by the judicial authorities of the State and carried out by the police authorities of the State (see paragraph 10 above). Thus, although the applicant did not suffer any severe or long-lasting physical effects, his punishment - whereby he was treated as an object in the power of the authorities - constituted an assault on precisely that which it is one of the main purposes of Article 3 (art. 3) to protect, namely a person ’ s dignity and physical integrity. Neither can it be excluded that the punishment may have had adverse psychological effects.",

However, this does not alter the fact that there had been an interval of several weeks since the applicant ’ s conviction by the juvenile court and a considerable delay in the police station where the punishment was carried out. Accordingly, in addition to the physical pain he experienced, Mr. Tyrer was subjected to the mental anguish of anticipating the violence he was to have inflicted on him."

That majority, he said, not only did not consider this penalty to be degrading but also saw it as an effective deterrent and as a desirable safeguard in the control of law and order.

Finally, he stated that the Commission ’ s view that there were no significant social or cultural differences between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom which could be relevant to the application of Article 3 (art. 3) in this case amounted to saying that Article 63 (3) (art. 63-3) in fact cannot be called in aid as regards territories with such close ties and affinities as in the case of the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom."

The undoubtedly sincere beliefs on the part of members of the local population afford some indication that judicial corporal punishment is considered necessary in the Isle of Man as a deterrent and to maintain law and order.

                "Moreover, even assuming that judicial corporal punishment did possess those advantages which are attributed to it by local public opinion, there is no evidence before the Court to show that law and order in the Isle of Man could not be maintained without recourse to that punishment. In this connection, it is noteworthy that, in the great majority of the member States of the Council of Europe, judicial corporal punishment is not, it appears, used and, indeed, in some of them, has never existed in modern times; in the Isle of Man itself, as already mentioned, the relevant legislation has been under review for many years. If nothing else, this casts doubt on whether the availability of this penalty is a requirement for the maintenance of law and order in a European country. The Isle of Man not only enjoys long-established and highly-developed political, social and cultural traditions but is an up-to-date society. Historically, geographically and culturally, the Island has always been included in the European family of nations and must be regarded as sharing fully that \"common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\" to which the Preamble to the Convention refers. The Court notes, in this connection, that the system established by Article 63 (art. 63) was primarily designed to meet the fact that, when the Convention was drafted, there were still certain colonial territories whose state of civilisation did not, it was thought, permit the full application of the Convention.",

Specifically, the applicant ’ s complaint concerned the outstanding supplementary pension for the period between 1990 and 1993 and, further, the allegedly ineffective and inadequate civil proceedings for damages, which the applicant submitted had deprived him of access to court, had been terminated in 2003 (see paragraph 24 above ).

In doing so, the Fund had explained that, as Serbia had been affected by hyperinflation during the said period for which the difference in pension was to be calculated, it had been impossible for it to calculate the exact amount to be paid in new dinars by converting that debt ( konverzija obračunate razlike za navedeni period ).

The only remedies which an applicant is required to avail himself of are those that relate to the breaches alleged and which are at the same time available and sufficient. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

On the other hand, according to domestic law, an enforcement instrument does not necessarily equate to a decision liable to enforcement if certain crucial elements are missing (see paragraph 42 above ). In view of the foregoing, as well as the Government ’ s pleadings (see paragraph 7 5 above), the Court must firstly ascertain whether the Fund ’ s monetary obligations established by the relevant part of the 1994 decision gave rise to a debt in the applicant ’ s favour that was sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Unistar Ventures GmbH v.

The calculation parameters provided by the 1994 decision appear to have provided sufficient basis for the expert engaged by the applicant in the enforcement proceedings to calculate the outstanding debt (see paragraph 21 above ). The 1994 decision was based on specific criteria/ parameters for further calculations of the supplementary pension, in regard to which the Fund had no discretion (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulgakova v. Russia, no. 69524/01, §§ 29 and 31, 18 January 2007, and contrast with Kiryanov v. Russia (dec.), no. 42212/02, 9 December 2004). This means that the outstanding debt was readily ascertainable."

It is understood that the State ’ s functions were delegated to the Fund and their exercise has been controlled by the State (see paragraph 29 above). The Court cannot endorse the submissions about the applicant ’ s failure to request “administrative enforcement” before the administrative bodies. The applicable administrative and enforcement legislation, as well as the Supreme Court and the Administrative Court ’ s interpretation of the law, had all designated the civil courts as the competent authorities for the execution of an administrative decision establishing a monetary obligation (see paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 48 and 50).

There was apparently legal uncertainty as to whether the administrative or judicial authorities were invested with jurisdiction ratione materiae in cases such as that of the applicant (see paragraph 46 above). The non-enforcement of the 1994 decision was due, to an extent, to the fact that the Fund had failed to indicate the exact amount to be paid to the applicant by way of supplementary pension. The debt established by the 1994 decision was the liability of the Fund, in charge of administering pensions, which omitted to pay the debt and strikingly claimed to lack the appropriate software to calculate the amount due in view of hyperinflation. In addition, the competent enforcement court was empowered to obtain expert reports in complex cases and was provided with sufficient calculation parameters to identify the amount due. However, the competent court did not even attempt to arrive at a final calculation, nor did it make any reference to the expert report supplied by the applicant. The manner in which the domestic court conducted these lengthy enforcement proceedings (see paragraphs 11-17 above) and the reasons given to decline jurisdiction in favour of the “administrative authorities” appear to be arbitrary. They did not comply with the procedures enshrined in the relevant legislation for the enforcement of final administrative decisions establishing obligations of a monetary nature (see paragraphs 37- 40, 44, 48, 50 and 53 above )."

This includes the conduct of proceedings for determining the cause of the death and holding those responsible to account, as well as the undertaking of a significant proportion of the procedural steps that were decisive for the course of the investigation. This is a corollary of the principle that the Court ’ s jurisdiction extends only to the procedural acts and omissions occurring after the entry into force.

Furthermore, it was a publicly known fact that the 1943 excavation had uncovered the remains of 4,243 people, of whom 2,730 individuals had been identified. Among those identified were three persons whose relatives had been complainants in the proceedings. The granting of victim status to the complainants would have allowed the identification of the remains with the use of genetic methods.

The complete secrecy surrounding the date of execution, and the place of burial and the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress. The Committee considers that the authorities ’ initial failure to notify the author of the scheduled date for the execution of her son, and their subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son ’ s grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the author, in violation of article 7 of the Covenant.”"

Having also noted the authors ’ arguments, the Committee considered that a distinction should be drawn between the complaint relating to Mr. Thomas Sankara and the complaint concerning Ms. Sankara and her children. The Committee considered that the death of Thomas Sankara, which may have involved violations of several articles of the Covenant, occurred on 15 October 1987, hence before the Covenant and the Optional Protocol entered into force for Burkina Faso. This part of the communication was therefore inadmissible ratione temporis. Thomas Sankara ’ s death certificate of 17 January 1988, stating that he died of natural causes – contrary to the facts, which are public knowledge and confirmed by the State party ... – and the authorities ’ failure to correct the certificate during the period since that time must be considered in the light of their continuing effect on Ms. Sankara and her children.",

Thomas Sankara ’ s family have the right to know the circumstances of his death, and the Committee points out that any complaint relating to acts prohibited under article 7 of the Covenant must be investigated rapidly and impartially by the competent authorities. In addition, the Committee notes, as it did during its deliberations on admissibility, the failure to correct Thomas Sankara ’ s death certificate of 17 January 1988, which records a natural death contrary to the publicly known facts, which have been confirmed by the State party. The Committee considers that the refusal to conduct an investigation into the death of Thomas Sankara, the lack of official recognition of his place of burial and the failure to correct the death certificate constitute inhuman treatment of Ms. Sankara and her sons, in breach of article 7 of the Covenant. ”",

To that end, it reviewed the applicable case-law of the Court and the principles governing the temporal limits of States ’ procedural obligations as they had been formulated in the Šilih v.

In addition, it pointed out that a significant proportion of the investigative steps required for ensuring compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2 must have been carried out after the ratification date. In the Chamber ’ s assessment, neither condition had been met in the instant case, in which the time lapse between the deaths (1940) and the ratification date (5 May 1998) was excessively long, too long in absolute terms to satisfy the “genuine connection” standard. Likewise, the Chamber was unable to find any indication in the file or in the parties ’ submissions that any procedural steps had been taken in the post-ratification period that would have been comparable in their significance to those carried out before the ratification date."

As this was the first case in which the Court had been called upon to give an interpretation of that clause, the Chamber – drawing inspiration from the Brecknell judgment ( see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, 27 November 2007) – construed it in the following manner.",

Far from being fortuitous, the reference of the underlying values of the Convention indicates that, for such connection to be established, the event in question must be of a larger dimension than an ordinary criminal offence and constitute a negation of the very foundations of the Convention, such as, for instance, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Although such crimes are not subject to a statutory limitation by virtue of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity ..., it does not mean that the States have an unceasing duty to investigate them. Nevertheless, the procedural obligation may be revived if information purportedly casting new light on the circumstances of such crimes comes into the public domain after the critical date. It cannot be the case that any assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention. Given the fundamental importance of this provision, the State authorities must be sensitive to any information or material which has the potential either to undermine the conclusions of an earlier investigation or to allow an earlier inconclusive investigation to be pursued further ... Should new material come to light in the post-ratification period and should it be sufficiently weighty and compelling to warrant a new round of proceedings, the Court will have temporal jurisdiction to satisfy itself that the respondent State has discharged its procedural obligation under Article 2 in a manner compatible with the principles enunciated in its case-law.” ( references omitted)"

In their view, this distinction was crucial, as only a “legally existing” violation of Article 2 in its substantive aspect – which might nevertheless have taken place outside the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction – could trigger the State ’ s procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1. In the cases previously examined by the Court, the events that triggered the duty to investigate had occurred after the adoption of the Convention. In the instant case the alleged violation of Article 2 under its substantive limb not only fell outside the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction but also had not existed de jure, since the “ Katyn events” had preceded the adoption of the Convention on 4 November 1950 by ten years and its ratification by Russia on 5 May 1998 by fifty-eight years. In the Government ’ s view, this precluded the Court from examining Russia ’ s compliance with its procedural obligations.

The Government submitted that no obligation to investigate the “Katyn events” could be said to have arisen, whether as a matter of domestic law or international humanitarian law or under the Convention. At the domestic level, an investigation had been conducted into a criminal offence punishable under Article 193-17 (b) of the 1926 Criminal Code of the RSFSR (abuse of power causing grave consequences, committed under aggravating circumstances) which had a limitation period of ten years. The contemporary Russian Code of Criminal Procedure required that the proceedings be discontinued upon the expiry of the limitation period. In addition, the officers of the NKVD of the USSR had died before the criminal investigation had been opened. As a matter of domestic criminal procedure, their death was a separate legal ground precluding criminal proceedings from being instituted against them or pursued. In international law, the death of suspects or defendants was also a universally recognised ground for refusing to institute or for discontinuing criminal proceedings (here the Government referred to Prosecutor v. Norman, Fofana and Kondewa, The Special Court for Sierra Leone, Trial Chamber decision of 21 May 2007, Case no. SCSL-04-14-T-776, and Prosecutor v. Slobodan Milošević, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Case no. IT-02-54 -T, Order Terminating the Proceedings, 14 March 2006).

From the standpoint of international humanitarian law the Government considered that, at least until 1945, there had existed no universally binding provision of international law on the definition of war crimes or crimes against humanity or on the attribution of responsibility and the prosecution of such crimes. Since the International Military Tribunal was an ad hoc tribunal, the provisions of its Charter, including the definitions of crimes contained therein, were limited to the proceedings before it against the major war criminals belonging to the European Axis powers. The Government concluded that international law, as it existed in 1940, did not provide a sufficient basis for characterising the “ Katyn events” as a war crime, a crime against humanity or genocide unless they were attributable to the major war criminals of the European Axis and fell within the jurisdiction of the Nuremberg Tribunal. Nevertheless, at the request of the Polish authorities, the Russian investigators had examined the “version of genocide” and determined that no such crime had been committed because the suspects had had purely criminal motives rather than an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group (according to the definition in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948)."

Secondly, in the opinion of the Government, only those events that took place after the adoption of the Convention could trigger any procedural obligation. Thirdly, the Russian authorities could not reasonably be expected to carry out an effective investigation some fifty ‑ eight years after the events when the witnesses had already died and the crucial documents had been destroyed. In the alternative, the Government pleaded that “the Convention impose [d] no specific obligation ... to provide redress for wrongs or damage caused prior to ... ratification” ( here they referred to Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 38, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX ). In other words, when the Court was prevented ratione temporis from examining the circumstances of a death, it could not establish whether or not it gave rise to a procedural obligation under Article 2 ( here they referred to Kholodovy v. Russia (dec.), no. 30651/05, 14 September 2006, and Moldovan and Others and Rostaş and Others v. Romania (dec.), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, 13 March 2001 )."

As to the detachability of the procedural obligation, the Russian Government pointed out that not every death would trigger the procedural obligation and that the Court had to examine at the outset whether the circumstances of the death were such as to bring the obligation into play. However, where the death had occurred before the ratification date, the Court would have no temporal jurisdiction to perform such an analysis. Furthermore, the detachability principle had to be subject to certain limitations if an unforeseeable extension of the Court ’ s jurisdiction and the Convention ’ s outreach were to be avoided. Firstly, the lapse of time had to be reasonably short, which it was not in the present case. Secondly, a significant portion of the investigative steps had to have been carried out after the ratification date. This criterion was likewise not fulfilled in the instant case. Finally, where the need to ensure the real and effective protection of the underlying values of the Convention was concerned, the Government agreed that the event in question had to be of a larger dimension than an ordinary criminal offence.

The expression “the underlying values of the Convention” had previously been invoked by the Court in finding that particular instances of hate speech, such as speech denying the Holocaust or justifying war crimes, were incompatible with the values of the Convention (here they referred to Garaudy v. France (dec.), no. 65831/01, ECHR 2003 - IX; Witzsch v. Germany (dec.), no. 7485/03, 13 December 2005; and Orban and Others v. France, no. 20985/05, § 35, 15 January 2009). Since speech denying the reality of crimes under international law was deemed to contravene the underlying values of the Convention, the same rationale should apply a fortiori to the acts themselves, which undermined the very meaning of justice and peace, the fundamental values of the Convention as expressed in its Preamble. In the applicants ’ submission, the mention of the underlying values in paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment indicated that there existed some instances of acts violating the very foundation of the Convention system whose nature, magnitude and gravity should give the Court jurisdiction ratione temporis to examine the State ’ s obligation to conduct an effective investigation."

The Polish soldiers captured by the Red Army had been entitled to the full protection guaranteed to prisoners of war, including the protection against acts of violence and cruelty afforded by the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention ( IV ) and the Geneva Convention of 1929. The murder of Polish prisoners of war in 1940 had been an unlawful act which violated Articles 4, 23 (c) and 50 of the 1907 Hague Convention ( IV ) and Articles 2, 46, 61 and 63 of the Geneva Convention of 1929. Even though the USSR had not been a party to either Convention, it had a duty to respect the universally binding principles of international customary law, which had merely been codified in those Conventions. That such an obligation was recognised as legally binding by the USSR was clearly evidenced by the fact that, at the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet prosecutor had attempted to charge the Nazi leaders with the murder of Polish prisoners of war. The extermination of Polish prisoners of war was a war crime within the meaning of Article 6 (b) of the Nuremberg Charter and the shooting of civilians amounted to a crime against humanity as defined in Article 6 (c) of the Nuremberg Charter. The Nuremberg Tribunal ’ s classification of the Katyn massacre as a war crime had to be viewed in objective terms and was not dependent upon who had actually committed the atrocity. Moreover, the execution of prisoners of war constituted and was treated as a war crime by the international community, a fact convincingly demonstrated by the abundant case-law from the post ‑ war trials of war criminals. As a crime under international law, the Katyn massacre had been imprescriptible at the time of its commission, as it was today, and the concomitant duty to investigate it survived to this day."

                "117. The applicants further referred to two factors which corroborated the argument regarding the Court ’ s competence to adjudicate on Russia ’ s compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2. Firstly, the Council of Europe and the Convention had come into being as democratic political and legal alternatives to the violations of human dignity committed on a massive scale by two totalitarian regimes, namely Nazism and Stalinism. The Katyn massacre had been carried out by a totalitarian regime whose aims and values radically contradicted those of the Convention. If the Convention was to be protected in a real and effective manner, the current Contracting Parties had to conduct effective investigations into totalitarian crimes. Secondly, an effective investigation into the Katyn massacre was a prerequisite for the “rehabilitation” of the murdered persons as victims of political repression and to increase public awareness of totalitarian crimes."

This test should also encompass cases where the domestic authorities had failed to collect new evidence or where they had adopted conclusions that starkly contradicted previous findings or historical facts. Although a decision to close the investigation was not as such new material for the investigation, it could constitute a new procedural development of relevance in the context of Article 2 of the Convention, especially since it marked a sudden change in the investigation. Moreover, when a significant portion of the investigation file became classified and the same status was given to the final decision in the investigation, there existed good reasons to presume that the sudden and radical change in the investigation must have resulted from relevant new findings."

They had not conducted full-scale excavations at all the burial sites. The applicants had been refused the status of injured parties in the proceedings and the investigation had lacked transparency on that account. Lastly, the investigation had not been geared towards identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice.

The Russian authorities had not taken evidence from the applicants or made any efforts to carry out forensic examinations or to uncover documents. They had made an incorrect assessment of the evidence that the Polish side had handed over to them and had wrongly characterised the Katyn massacre as an abuse of power. The applicants had been denied the right to participate in the investigation and had not been granted the procedural status of injured parties.

This obligation was implicit in the prohibition on applying statutory limitations to such crimes and it was not subject to any temporal qualification. Admittedly, the conduct of effective investigations became more challenging with the passing of time; however, the existing practice of national and international courts to assert jurisdiction over past violations indicated that successful prosecutions were possible even many decades after the underlying facts.

As the second sentence of paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment indicates, the connection will be established if much of the investigation into the death took place or ought to have taken place in the period following the entry into force of the Convention. This includes the conduct of proceedings for determining the cause of the death and holding those responsible to account, as well as the undertaking of a significant proportion of the procedural steps that were decisive for the course of the investigation. This is a corollary of the principle that the Court ’ s jurisdiction extends only to the procedural acts and omissions occurring after the entry into force. If, however, a major part of the proceedings or the most important procedural steps took place before the entry into force, this may irretrievably undermine the Court ’ s ability to make a global assessment of the effectiveness of the investigation from the standpoint of the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the Convention."

The last sentence of paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment does not exclude such an eventuality, which would operate as an exception to the general rule of the “genuine connection” test. In all the cases outlined above the Court accepted the existence of a “genuine connection” as the lapse of time between the death and the critical date was reasonably short and a considerable part of the proceedings had taken place after the critical date. Against this background, the present case is the first one which may arguably fall into this other, exceptional, category.

The heinous nature and gravity of such crimes prompted the Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity to agree that they must be imprescriptible and not subject to any statutory limitation in the domestic legal order. The Court nonetheless considers that the “Convention values” clause cannot be applied to events which occurred prior to the adoption of the Convention, on 4 November 1950, for it was only then that the Convention began its existence as an international human rights treaty. Hence, a Contracting Party cannot be held responsible under the Convention for not investigating even the most serious crimes under international law if they predate the Convention. Although the Court is sensitive to the argument that even today some countries have successfully tried those responsible for war crimes committed during the Second World War, it emphasises the fundamental difference between having the possibility of prosecuting an individual for a serious crime under international law where circumstances allow it, and being obliged to do so by the Convention.",

The prisoners were killed and buried in mass graves on various dates in April and May 1940.

Generally, this finding of fact has been reached in response to claims made by the respondent Government that the person is still alive or has not been shown to have died at the hands of State agents. This presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (see Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, § 100, 18 December 2012; Varnava and Others, cited above, § 143; and Vagapova and Zubirayev v.

The Politburo ’ s decision of 5 March 1940 stipulated that all Polish prisoners of war being held in the NKVD camps, without exception, were liable to extrajudicial execution, which was carried out by the Soviet secret police in the following months. Mass burials of prisoners wearing Polish uniforms were uncovered in the Katyn Forest as early as 1943, following the German takeover of the territory. A note written in 1959 by the Head of the KGB, a successor to the NKVD, acknowledged that a total of more than twenty-one thousand Polish prisoners had been shot by NKVD officials.

Official visits and coordination meetings were held between the Russian, Polish, Ukrainian and Belarusian authorities. However, all these steps took place before the critical date. As regards the post entry into force period, it is impossible, on the basis of the information available in the case file and in the parties ’ submissions, to identify any real investigative steps after 5 May 1998. The Court is unable to accept that a re-evaluation of the evidence, a departure from previous findings or a decision regarding the classification of the investigation materials could be said to have amounted to the “significant proportion of the procedural steps” which is required for establishing a “genuine connection” for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention. Nor has any relevant piece of evidence or substantive item of information come to light in the period since the critical date.

The Chamber qualified that approach as “a callous disregard for the applicants ’ concerns and deliberate obfuscation of the circumstances of the Katyn massacre”. As regards the rehabilitation proceedings, the Chamber considered that “a denial of the reality of the mass murder reinforced by the implied proposition that Polish prisoners may have had a criminal charge to answer and had been duly sentenced to capital punishment demonstrated [an] attitude vis-à-vis the applicants that was not just opprobrious but also lacking in humanity”."

The Government argued that the actions of the domestic authorities had been justified, pointing out firstly that the “rehabilitation” of the Polish prisoners had been impossible in the absence of any information about the charges that had been levelled against them. Secondly, the authorities had been under no legal obligation to locate the applicants or to grant them victim status, since there had been insufficient evidence to establish a causal connection between the “ Katyn events” and the death of the applicants ’ relatives to the standard of proof required in criminal proceedings.

Referring to the case-law of the Inter ‑ American Court of Human Rights, the applicants submitted that all of them were victims of the grievances formulated under Article 3, either as adult direct relatives of the persons who had been killed, or as indirect relatives who had demonstrated their strong and continuous personal involvement through numerous actions relating to the fate of their family members who had been killed."

In the Katyn case, the sequence was reversed: those who were “dead” had become “disappeared” in the eyes of the Russian authorities. That reversal represented a sheer denial of historical facts and inflicted severe pain, anguish and stress on the applicants. It was tantamount to informing a group of relatives of Holocaust victims that the victims must be considered unaccounted for as their fate could only be traced to the dead-end track of a concentration camp because the documents had been destroyed by the Nazi authorities. Moreover, in so far as the military prosecutors had claimed that they were unable to establish “which provision of the Penal Code formed the legal basis for calling the [Polish] prisoner [ s ] to account”, this was essentially an allegation that the victims might have been criminals who had been duly sentenced to capital punishment. Furthermore, in the rehabilitation proceedings before the Moscow Court, the prosecutor had argued that there existed “due reasons” for the repression, as some Polish officers had been “spies, terrorists and saboteurs” and as the Polish pre-war army “had been trained to fight against the Soviet Union”.

The finding of a violation on this ground is not limited to cases where the respondent State is to be held responsible for the disappearance. It can also result from the failure of the authorities to respond to the quest for information by the relatives or from the obstacles placed in their way, leaving them to bear the brunt of the efforts to uncover any facts, where this attitude may be regarded as disclosing a flagrant, continuous and callous disregard of an obligation to account for the fate of the missing person (see, in particular, Açış v.

In a series of Chechen cases in which the applicants had not witnessed the killing of their relatives but had found out about their deaths only on discovery of their bodies, the Court considered that no separate finding of a violation of Article 3 was necessary, given that it had already found a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive and procedural aspects (see Velkhiyev and Others, § 137; Sambiyev and Pokayeva, §§ 74 ‑ 75; and Tangiyeva, § 104, all cited above )."

Russia, no. 36150/04, § 97, 29 May 2012; Yasin Ateş v. Turkey, no. 30949/96, § 135, 31 May 2005; Udayeva and Yusupova v. Russia, no. 36542/05, § 82, 21 December 2010; Khashuyeva v.

The family members of the applicants had been taken prisoner by the Soviet occupation forces and had been detained in Soviet camps. There is evidence that exchanges of correspondence between the Polish prisoners and their families continued until the spring of 1940, so the families must have been aware that their relatives were alive. After the letters from them stopped coming to Poland, their relatives remained for many years in a state of uncertainty as to the fate that had befallen them."

However, only three of the applicants ’ relatives – Mr Wołk, Mr Rodowicz and Mr Mielecki – were identified at that time. The Soviet authorities denied that they had executed the Polish prisoners of war and, without access to the Politburo or NKVD files, it was not possible to ascertain the fate of those prisoners whose bodies had not been identified. No further attempts at identifying the victims of the Katyn massacre were made during the Cold War, since the Soviet version of Nazi-orchestrated killings was imposed as the official one in the People ’ s Republic of Poland for the entire duration of the existence of the Socialist regime, that is, until 1989."

Having regard to the long lapse of time, to the material that came to light in the intervening period and to the efforts that were deployed by various parties to elucidate the circumstances of the Katyn massacre, the Court finds that, as regards the period after the critical date, the applicants cannot be said to have been in a state of uncertainty as to the fate of their relatives who had been taken prisoner by the Soviet army in 1939. It necessarily follows that what could initially have been a “disappearance” case must be considered to be a “confirmed death” case. The applicants acquiesced in that assessment of the present case (see, in particular, paragraph 116 above and also paragraph 119 of the Chamber judgment ). This finding is undisturbed by the pronouncements of the Russian courts in various domestic proceedings which appeared to withhold explicit acknowledgment of the fact that the applicants ’ relatives had been killed in the Soviet camps."

Turkey [GC], no. 27396/06, § 50, 29 June 2012). The Court ’ s case-law, as outlined above, has accepted that the suffering of family members of a “disappeared person” who have to go through a long period of alternating hope and despair may justify finding a separate violation of Article 3 on account of the particularly callous attitude of the domestic authorities to their quest for information. As regards the instant case, the Court ’ s jurisdiction extends only to the period starting on 5 May 1998, the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia. The Court has found above that as from that date, no lingering uncertainty as to the fate of the Polish prisoners of war could be said to have remained. Even though not all of the bodies have been recovered, their death was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet and Russian authorities and has become an established historical fact. The magnitude of the crime committed in 1940 by the Soviet authorities is a powerful emotional factor, yet, from a purely legal point of view, the Court cannot accept it as a compelling reason for departing from its case-law on the status of the family members of “disappeared persons” as victims of a violation of Article 3 and conferring that status on the applicants, for whom the death of their relatives was a certainty."

That provision reads as follows:",

It further noted the absence of a plausible explanation on the part of the respondent Government as to the nature of the security concerns that informed the decision to classify the requested document. It observed that the requested document “related to a historical event, with most of the protagonists being already dead, and it could not have touched upon any current police surveillance operations or activities”. On a more general note, the Chamber observed that a public and transparent investigation into the crimes of the previous totalitarian regime could hardly have compromised the national security interests of the contemporary democratic Russian Federation, especially taking into account that the responsibility of the Soviet authorities for that crime has been acknowledged at the highest political level."

They claimed that Russian law did not contain an absolute prohibition on communicating sensitive information to international organisations and that the decision of 21 September 2004 had not been disclosed to the Court solely because “the competent domestic bodies [had] not come to [ the ] conclusion” that it would be possible to do so."

The Government maintained that Article 38 of the Convention could not be interpreted in such a way as to require Contracting States to disclose information that was likely to impair their security. They invited the Court to analyse the laws of other member States “which very likely might have foreseen similar rules”. The Government referred to the provisions of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Poland on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil and Criminal Cases, which allowed the Contracting State to refuse to execute the request if it was likely to prejudice the sovereignty, security, public order or other essential interests of the country (here they also referred to Liu v.

In their view, Article 38 should have been examined at the end of the judgment, as had been done in previous cases. They emphasised that the obligation under Article 38 was “of a purely procedural nature”, and that an alleged breach thereof “could not cause any suffering to the applicants” or “outweigh the gravity of the alleged violations of Article 2 and Article 3”. The Government disagreed that the obligation under Article 38 had to be enforced in all circumstances; in their opinion, it was derivative by its nature and conditional on the existence of admissible complaints under other Convention provisions. In the instant case, there was no point in examining the Government ’ s compliance with Article 38, since the Court should find that it lacked jurisdiction to take cognisance of the merits of the complaint under Article 2 of the Convention."

This principle was codified in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as an extension of the more general pacta sunt servanda principle, and had been frequently invoked in the jurisprudence of international courts and quasi-judicial bodies including the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples ’ Rights, and arbitration tribunals. When confronted with a State Party ’ s reluctance to submit the requested materials on account of confidentiality concerns, international tribunals held hearings in a closed session ( the applicants referred to the IACtHR ’ s judgment in Godínez Cruz v. Honduras (merits), judgment of 20 January 1989, Series C No. 5, and the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation in Ballo v. UNESCO, judgment no. 191, 15 May 1972). In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ had not drawn any negative inferences when the United Kingdom refused to submit evidence which it considered to be related to naval secrecy ( see Corfu Channel case, judgment of 9 April 1949: ICJ Reports 1949 ). However, the ICTY had rejected the Croatian government ’ s reliance on the Corfu judgment as justification for their refusal to produce certain documents and evidence of a military character in the Prosecutor v. Tihomir Blaškić case, holding, in particular, that a blanket right of States to withhold, for security reasons, documents necessary for proceedings might jeopardise the very function of the Tribunal ( Case No. IT-95-14- AR108 bis, judgment of 29 October 1997). It had added that the validity of State security concerns could be accommodated by procedural arrangements, including in camera hearings and special procedures for communicating and recording sensitive documents. In the later case of Prosecutor v. Dario Kordić and Mario Čerkez ( Case No. IT-95-14/2, decision of 9 September 1999), the ICTY had also held that the question of the relevance of the requested material for the proceedings fell within its full discretion and could not be challenged by States.

Even if it did include data on the individuals with respect to whom the proceedings had been conducted, this could not constitute a basis for classifying the entire decision as top secret. Any information on high-ranking USSR officials concerned the period up to 1970 and, accordingly, by the time the decision was issued, the maximum thirty-year classification period established in section 13 of the State Secrets Act had already elapsed. In addition, in so far as the Russian Government admitted that the actions of the USSR officials had been characterised in law as an abuse of power, this information was explicitly excluded from classification by virtue of section 7 of the State Secrets Act.

Indeed, the effective exercise of this right may be thwarted by a Contracting Party ’ s failure to assist the Court in conducting an examination of all circumstances relating to the case, including in particular by not producing evidence which the Court considers crucial for its task.

The Court also reiterates in this connection that it may establish a failure by the respondent Government to comply with their procedural obligations even in the absence of any admissible complaint about a violation of a substantive Convention right (see Poleshchuk v. Russia, no. 60776/00, 7 October 2004). Furthermore, it is not required that the Government ’ s alleged interference should have actually restricted, or had any appreciable impact on, the exercise of the right of individual petition (see McShane v. the United Kingdom, no. 43290/98, § 151, 28 May 2002). The Court reaffirms that the Contracting Party ’ s procedural obligations under Articles 34 and 38 of the Convention must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives."

                "210. Turning to the justification advanced by the Government for their failure to produce a copy of the requested decision, the Court observes that it focused on the fact that the decision had been lawfully classified at domestic level and that the existing laws and regulations prevented the Government from communicating classified material to international organisations in the absence of guarantees as to its confidentiality."

                "211. The Court reiterates that it has already found in another case against Russia that a mere reference to the structural deficiency of the domestic law which rendered impossible communication of sensitive documents to international bodies is an insufficient explanation to justify the withholding of information requested by the Court (see Nolan and K. , cited above, § 56). It has also previously rejected similar objections from the Russian Government relating to the alleged lack of safeguards in the Court ’ s procedure guaranteeing the confidentiality of documents or imposing sanctions on foreign nationals for a breach of confidentiality (see Shakhgiriyeva and Others, cited above, §§ 136-40). The Court reiterates in this connection that the Convention is an international treaty which, in accordance with the principle of pacta sunt servanda codified in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is binding on the Contracting Parties and must be performed by them in good faith. Pursuant to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention, the provisions of internal law may not be invoked as justification for a failure by the Contracting State to abide by its treaty obligations. In the context of the obligation flowing from the text of Article 38 of the Convention, this requirement means that the respondent Government may not rely on domestic legal impediments, such as the absence of a special decision by a different agency of the State, to justify a failure to furnish all the facilities necessary for the Court ’ s examination of the case. It has been the Court ’ s constant position that Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of any State agency since what is in issue in all cases before the Court is the international responsibility of the State (see Lukanov v. Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, § 40, Reports 1997 ‑ II)."

It has become clear that the classification decision was not made by the Chief Military Prosecutor ’ s Office of its own initiative but rather on the basis of the opinion of some officials from the Federal Security Service, which had “the right to dispose as it saw fit of the information reproduced in the Chief Military Prosecutor ’ s decision”. It was also stated that the decision of 21 September 2004 contained information “in the field of intelligence, counterintelligence and operational and search activities”, without further elaboration (see paragraph 64 above)."

However, even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision and the relevant evidence. If there was no possibility of challenging effectively the executive ’ s assertion that national security was at stake, the State authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the Convention (see Liu, cited above, §§ 85-87, and Al ‑ Nashif v.

In the instant case the Moscow City Court ’ s judgment of 2 November 2010, as endorsed by the Supreme Court, contains no substantive analysis of the reasons for maintaining the classified status of the case materials. It is not even apparent whether the City Court was presented with a copy of the expert report issued by the Federal Security Service. The national courts did not subject to any meaningful scrutiny the executive ’ s assertion that information contained in that decision should be kept secret more than seventy years after the events. They confined the scope of their inquiry to ascertaining that the classification decision had been issued within the administrative competence of the relevant authorities, without carrying out an independent review of whether the conclusion that its declassification constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact. The Russian courts did not address in substance Memorial ’ s argument that the decision brought to an end the investigation into a mass murder of unarmed prisoners, that is, one of the most serious violations of human rights committed on orders from the highest-ranking Soviet officials, and that it was not therefore amenable to classification by virtue of section 7 of the State Secrets Act. Finally, they did not perform a balancing exercise between the alleged need to protect the information owned by the Federal Security Service, on the one hand, and the public interest in a transparent investigation into the crimes of the previous totalitarian regime and the private interest of the victims ’ relatives in uncovering the circumstances of their death, on the other hand. Given the restricted scope of the domestic judicial review of the classification decision, the Court is unable to accept that the submission of a copy of the decision of 21 September 2004, as it had requested, could have affected Russia ’ s national security."

The issue of whether or not contacts between the authorities and an applicant amount to unacceptable practices from the standpoint of Article 34 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. In the context of the questioning of applicants about their applications under the Convention by authorities exercising a domestic investigative function, this will depend on whether the procedures adopted have involved a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure which may be regarded as hindering the exercise of the right of individual application (see, e.g. the Aydin v.

It held that the provisions of the Law were clear and unambiguous, that they were accessible in that they were published in the Official Gazette and that they were foreseeable as they enabled, with sufficient precision, Moldovan citizens wishing to stand for Parliament but holding another nationality to adopt appropriate social-minded conduct to ensure that their rights were not curtailed. It emphasised that Law no. 273 did not prevent dual nationals from becoming MPs as it offered them the possibility of complying with the law. It further considered the provisions of the Law to be in conformity with norms of international law, concluding that the various international instruments permitted States to stipulate incompatibilities relating to the holding of multiple nationalities by public officials."

The court also found Law no. 273 to be in pursuit of a legitimate aim, namely loyalty to the Moldovan State, in the light of the importance of State sovereignty and the need for a permanent political and legal link between an elector and the State. It considered that for Moldovan citizens holding the nationality of another State, the significance of Moldovan citizenship was substantially diminished as such a person might not be guided only by the constitutional requirements of Moldova and the interests of the Moldovan people but also by the interests of a foreign State. Accordingly, allowing MPs to hold dual nationality was contrary to the constitutional principle of the independence of the mandate of MPs, State sovereignty, national security and the non-disclosure of confidential information. In this regard, the court insisted that ensuring national security and consolidating Moldovan statehood had become an urgent necessity in the light of movements to undermine the Moldovan State."

Germany, 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28 ); where a Law punishing homosexual acts was likely to be applied to a certain category of the population, to which the applicant belonged ( see Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45); and, lastly, where the forced removal of aliens had already been decided on but not yet carried out and enforcement of the measure would have exposed the persons concerned to the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in the country of destination ( see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161) or would have infringed the right to respect for family life ( see Beldjoudi v. France, 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234 ‑ A ). The Government argued that States Parties had not agreed when ratifying the Convention that draft laws could be challenged before the Court. If such challenges were possible, where there was no possibility at domestic level to challenge a draft law applicants would be encouraged to come directly to the Court, breaching the principle of subsidiarity and leading to a large increase in the number of cases before the Court."

In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure : the Convention does not envisage the bringing of an actio popularis for the interpretation of the rights it contains or permit individuals to complain about a provision of national law simply because they consider, without having been directly affected by it, that it may contravene the Convention. However, it is open to a person to contend that a Law violates his rights, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if he is required either to modify his conduct or risks being prosecuted or if he is a member of a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, §§ 33 and 34, ECHR 2008; Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v.

In this respect, it refers to its case-law on loss of victim status where it has examined objections raised by respondent Governments that steps taken by or in the respondent State subsequent to the lodging of the application with the Court afforded adequate redress for the alleged violation such that the applicant could no longer be considered a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention (see, for example, Amuur v.

He has initiated this procedure (see paragraphs 60 - 61 above). Again, following his election in July 2009, the applicant was required to provide evidence of his initiation of the renunciation procedure to the Constitutional Court in order to have his mandate confirmed (see paragraph 66 above). The Court accordingly concludes that the applicant was directly affected by Law no. 273 as he was obliged to initiate a procedure which put him at risk of losing his Romanian nationality. Further and in any event, even before his election the knowledge that, if elected, he would be required to take steps to renounce his Romanian nationality if he wished to take his seat in Parliament undoubtedly affected him throughout his electoral campaign. He may, moreover, have lost votes since the electorate was aware that there was a chance that he would decide not to take his seat if that would mean losing his status as a dual national.

It is true that the Romanian Government have not yet taken steps to strip the applicant of his Romanian nationality.

They pointed out that when the ECN was ratified in 1999, the number of Moldovans holding dual nationality was insignificant as it was not permitted under the law in force at the time (see paragraph 22 above). Accordingly, no reservation in respect of Article 17 was thought necessary. They further explained that in 1999, Moldova was not a parliamentary republic as it is today, but a semi-presidential republic. The legislature therefore played a greater role in the State today than it did then. Although of the other Council of Europe member States which banned dual nationals from sitting as MPs, Azerbaijan, Lithuania and Malta had not ratified the ECN and Bulgaria had lodged a reservation to Article 17, Moldova could simply denounce the ECN and, if it wished to do so, re-ratify it subject to a reservation in respect of Article 17.

The example of Mrs Savga (see paragraph 144 above) was evidence of the arbitrary application of the new Law. In the applicant ’ s submission, it was relevant for the Court whether the effect of rules governing elections excluded a group of persons from participating in the political life of a country, whether discrepancies created by a particular electoral system could be considered arbitrary or abusive and whether the system tended to favour one political party over another ( referring to, inter alia, Aziz v.

The fact that Moldova had chosen to change its position on the possibility of acquiring dual nationality did not absolve it from complying with its obligations under the ECN.

One example was Law no. 720 of 18 September 1991, regulating presidential elections. The Romanian Government, relying on Ždanoka v.

It was therefore difficult to understand the position of Moldova, which for three parliaments had allowed multiple citizens to become MPs but which now, some seventeen years later, considered the possession of another citizenship to constitute a grave danger to Moldova and assimilated dual nationality with treason.

The Court observes that the Constitutional Court found the aim pursued by the prohibition to be securing the loyalty of MPs to the State and concluded that allowing MPs to hold dual nationality was contrary to the constitutional principle of the independence of the mandate of MPs, State sovereignty, national security and the non-disclosure of confidential information (see paragraph 56 above).

While the need to ensure loyalty to the State may well constitute a legitimate aim which justifies restrictions on electoral rights, the latter cannot. In a democratic State committed to the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, it is clear that the very role of MPs, and in particular those members from opposition parties, is to represent the electorate by ensuring the accountability of the government in power and assessing their policies. Further, the pursuit of different, and at times diametrically opposite, goals is not only acceptable but necessary in order to promote pluralism and to give voters choices which reflect their political opinions. As the Court has previously noted, protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, and in particular Articles 10 and 11. This principle is all the more important in relation to MPs in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy ( see, regarding the importance of freedom of expression for political parties in general, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 88, ECHR 2003 - II )."

As to what loyalty is required from MPs to the State, the Court considers that such loyalty in principle encompasses respect for the country ’ s Constitution, laws, institutions, independence and territorial integrity. However, the notion of respect in this context must be limited to requiring that any desire to bring about changes to any of these aspects must be pursued in accordance with the laws of the State. Any other view would undermine the ability of MPs to represent the views of their constituents, in particular minority groups. The Court has previously emphasised that there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State ’ s population and to take part in the nation ’ s political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned. Similarly, in the present case, the fact that Moldovan MPs with dual nationality may wish to pursue a political programme which is considered by some to be incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Moldovan State does not make it incompatible with the rules of democracy. A fundamental aspect of democracy is that it must allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even where they call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, §§ 45 and 47, Reports 1998 - III, and Manole and Others v. Moldova, no. 13936/02, § 95, ECHR 2009)."

                "168. With this in mind, the Court turns to consider whether the measure in the present case was genuinely intended to secure loyalty to the State as alleged by the Government. In this regard, the Court observes that Law no. 273 was the third aspect of an electoral reform package, whose other measures consisted of raising the electoral threshold and banning electoral blocs (see paragraph 37 above). All the measures proposed had a detrimental impact on the opposition, which had previously found it difficult to secure enough votes to meet the threshold to enter Parliament and had succeeded in doing so only through the formation of electoral blocs (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). The results of the April 2009 elections, in which of the 101 MPs elected, 21 were negatively affected by Law no. 273 and all 21 were opposition MPs (see paragraph 59 above), demonstrate the disproportionate effect of the new Law. The applicant ’ s allegation that the Law exempts from its scope the residents of Transdniestria, a large number of whom hold Russian nationality, raises further concerns about the true aim of the legislation (however, see further paragraph 187 below concerning the ambiguity surrounding this exemption). Finally, the Court considers it significant that the amendments were introduced less than a year before the general elections (see paragraph 44 above). Following the April 2009 elections, a further amendment was introduced to the electoral legislation, which was again criticised by opposition parties as being intended to improve the prospects of the governing party and its political allies (see paragraph 63 above). In this regard, the Court refers to the Venice Commission Code of Practice in Electoral Matters, which warns of the risk that frequent changes to electoral legislation or changes introduced just before elections will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as an attempt to manipulate electoral laws to the advantage of the party in power (see paragraph 86 above). It is also significant that the Monitoring Committee and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed concern at the changes to the electoral legislation, which they considered restricted opportunities for political forces to participate effectively in the political process and thus weakened pluralism (see paragraphs 47 and 49 - 50 above)."

The Court notes that, of the other States in the region, a ban in Romania, which allows dual nationality, on dual nationals sitting as MPs was lifted as recently as 2003. Bulgaria currently adopts the same approach as Moldova (see paragraph 87 above). Ukraine continues to prohibit dual nationality (see paragraph 90 above). The restriction introduced by Law no. 273 must be assessed with due regard to this special historico-political context and the resultant wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State (see Ždanoka, cited above, § 121). Accordingly, the Court does not exclude that in the immediate aftermath of the Declaration of Independence by Moldova in 1991, a ban on multiple nationals sitting as MPs could be justified."

            [
                "174. However, the Court considers it significant that the ban was not put in place in 1991 but in 2008, some seventeen years after Moldova had gained independence and some five years after it had relaxed its laws to allow dual citizenship. In the circumstances, the Court considers the argument that the measure was necessary to protect Moldova ’ s laws, institutions and national security to be far less persuasive. In order for the recent introduction of general restrictions on electoral rights to be justified, particularly compelling reasons must be advanced. However, the Government have not provided an explanation of why concerns have recently emerged regarding the loyalty of dual citizens and why such concerns were not present when the law was first changed to allow dual citizenship. The Government argued that the numbers involved – around one - fifth of current MPs hold or are in the process of applying for a second nationality – are sufficient to justify the approach taken (see paragraph 140 above). The Court acknowledges that the numbers are significant. However, it also emphasises that a large proportion of citizens also hold dual nationality (see paragraphs 26 - 28 above) and that these citizens have the right to be represented by MPs who reflect their concerns and political views."

                "175. The Court further refers to its judgment in Ādamsons ( cited above, § 123 ), in which it noted that with the passage of time, general restrictions on electoral rights become more difficult to justify. There, the Court emphasised the need to “individualise” measures, to take account of the actual conduct of individuals rather than a perceived threat posed by a group of persons. In the present case, the Court considers that there are other means of protecting Moldova ’ s laws, institutions and national security. Sanctions for illegal conduct or conduct which threatens national interests are likely to have a preventative effect and enable any particular threat posed by an identified individual to be addressed. The Government have not suggested that security clearance for access to confidential documents is inadequate to ensure protection of confidential and sensitive information. It should be noted that both of these measures are concerned with identifying a credible threat to State interest in particular circumstances based on specific information, rather than operating on a blanket assumption that all dual nationals pose a threat to national security and independence. The Court reiterates that this is the approach preferred where an immediate threat to democracy or independence has passed ( ibid., § 125)."

                "176. Further, and in any event, historico-political considerations should be viewed in the broader context of the obligations which Moldova has freely undertaken under the ECN and the recommendations and conclusions of relevant international bodies. It is appropriate to consider in this context the objection ratione materiae raised by the respondent Government (see paragraphs 131 - 32 above). The Court emphasises that it has consistently held that it must take into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. It is for the Court to decide which international instruments and reports it considers relevant and how much weight to attribute to them. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see, inter alia, Demir and Baykara, cited above, §§ 85 - 86, and Shtukaturov, cited above, § 95). In the present case, the Court considers the provisions of the ECN, the conclusions and reports of ECRI and the Venice Commission (see paragraphs 45 and 51 above) and the resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 48 - 50 above ) to be relevant to its assessment of whether Law no. 273 is proportionate. In particular, in making reference to the ECN, the Court is not seeking to examine the applicant ’ s right to hold dual nationality but rather the right of the respondent State to introduce restrictions on his right to take his seat following his election as a result of his dual nationality and the compatibility of any such restriction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1."

As to the content of such reports and commentaries, the Court observes that the Venice Commission, ECRI, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Monitoring Committee were unanimous in their criticism of the prohibition (see paragraphs 45 - 51 above). Concerns were expressed as to the discriminatory impact of Law no. 273 as well as its impact on the ability of a number of political forces to participate effectively in the political process. The Court further takes note of Article 17 of the ECN and Moldova ’ s undertaking pursuant to that Article to ensure that Moldovan nationals in possession of another nationality have the same rights and duties as other Moldovan nationals (see paragraph 85 above)."

                "178. Finally, the Court notes that any restriction on electoral rights should not be such as to exclude some persons or groups of persons from participating in the political life of the country (see paragraph 158 above). In this respect, the Court emphasises the disproportionate effect of the Law on the parties which were at the time of its introduction in opposition (see paragraph 168 above). Pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise, which necessarily entails various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998 ‑ I, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 108, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI ). In order to promote such dialogue and exchange of views necessary for an effective democracy, it is important to ensure access to the political arena for opposition parties on terms which allow them to represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests (see Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 67, ECHR 2006 - II )."

The Court must examine with particular care any measure which appears to operate solely, or principally, to the disadvantage of the opposition, especially where the nature of the measure is such that it affects the very prospect of opposition parties gaining power at some point in the future. Restrictions of this nature curtail the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness. The introduction of the prohibition in the present case shortly before the elections, at a time when the governing party ’ s percentage of the vote was in decline (see paragraphs 31 - 44 above), further militates against the proportionality of the measure."

In the ECJ’s view, such criteria had not been applied in the present case, since the status of the existing channels had not been amended under the transitional schemes and they had continued their broadcasting activities to the detriment of operators such as the applicant company, which, because it had not been allocated any broadcasting frequencies, had been unable to exercise its rights and make use of its licence.",

According to AGCOM, this delay was due to several factors. Firstly, the legal situation was complicated because it was difficult to identify the available broadcasting frequencies as a result of the court decisions in which the over-quota channels had been allowed to continue broadcasting. In addition, the transitional arrangements introduced by Law no. 66/2001 (see paragraphs 63-64 below), which had allowed the channels in question to continue broadcasting in analogue mode, had prevented the plan from being implemented on account of the incompatibility between the interests of the channels likely to be allowed to broadcast under the plan and the interests of the channels that were legally entitled to continue their existing operations."

Damage had thus been sustained as a result of an unlawful act for which the authorities incurred non-contractual liability, concerning both the breach of legitimate expectations and the delay in allocating the frequencies. The fact that the authorities had launched a public tendering procedure for the frequencies in 1999, although the situation in the broadcasting sector had not been clarified and there were outstanding technical issues, had been “risky”. The Consiglio di Stato considered that the question of redress for the damage sustained by the applicant company should take this context into account. The authorities’ conduct had not been characterised by “significant gravity” ( notevole gravità ) and the unlawful act was thus attributable to “negligent” and not intentional conduct on their part."

As to the criteria for determining the damages to be awarded, the Consiglio di Stato pointed out that, as regards the losses sustained, the applicant company had been fully aware, at the time of the call for tenders, of the circumstances of the case and the conditions to which the licence was subject. Furthermore, the sequence of events that had prevented the frequencies from being allocated had been largely foreseeable. Accordingly, the applicant company should have known that it was unlikely to obtain the frequencies, at least in the short term. In addition, it could have purchased the frequencies under section 1 of Law no. 66/2001 (see paragraph 64 below).",

It refused to take into account the expert valuation submitted by the applicant company and held that it was unlikely that the company would have purchased shares in the market, even in the event that the over-quota channels had relinquished the frequencies. In the Consiglio di Stato ’s view, the comparison between the applicant company and the two leading operators (Mediaset and RAI) was unjustified, especially as it did not take into account the other nationwide operator (La 7), which, although it had greater economic power than the applicant company, was nevertheless operating at a loss.",

In judgment no. 420 of 5 December 1994, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provisions allowing the three channels controlled by the Mediaset group (Canale 5, Italia Uno and Retequattro) to occupy a dominant position. It held that the provision whereby the same operator could hold several television-broadcasting licences on condition that it did not exceed 25% of the total number of national channels – that is, three channels in all – was not sufficient to prevent concentration of television channels, and was accordingly in breach of Article 21 of the Constitution in that it did not make it possible to guarantee the plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court considered that the existence of legislation to prevent dominant positions from being established was an essential requirement to justify the State’s relinquishment of its monopoly on broadcasting. The creation of such dominant positions in this sector would not only have had the effect of changing the rules on competition but would also have led to the emergence of an oligopoly and would have breached the fundamental principle of plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court thus held that the mere coexistence of a State-owned company and private companies (a mixed system) within the broadcasting sector was not sufficient to secure respect for the right to receive information from several competing sources.

                "“1. Italy is a founding member of the Council of Europe and strongly supports the ideals for which it stands. The Parliamentary Assembly is therefore concerned by the concentration of political, commercial and media power in the hands of one person, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.",
                "2. The Parliamentary Assembly cannot accept that this anomaly be minimised on the grounds that it only poses a potential problem. A democracy is judged not only by its day-to-day operations but by the principles the country upholds with regard to its own citizens and internationally. The Assembly recalls that, in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, States have a duty to protect and, when necessary, take positive measures to safeguard and promote media pluralism.",
                "3. The Assembly deplores the fact that several consecutive Italian governments since 1994 have failed to resolve the problem of conflict of interest and that appropriate legislation has not yet been adopted by the present Parliament. It disagrees that the leading principle of the Frattini Bill currently under consideration – that only managers, not owners, should be held responsible – provides a genuine and comprehensive solution to the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi.",
                "4. Through Mediaset, Italy’s main commercial communications and broadcasting group, and one of the largest in the world, Mr Berlusconi owns approximately half of the nationwide broadcasting in the country. His role as head of government also puts him in a position to influence indirectly the public broadcasting organisation, RAI, which is Mediaset’s main competitor. As Mediaset and RAI command together about 90% of the television audience and over three quarters of the resources in this sector, Mr Berlusconi exercises unprecedented control over the most powerful media in Italy.",
                "5. This duopoly in the television market is in itself an anomaly from an antitrust perspective. The status quo has been preserved even though legal provisions affecting media pluralism have twice been declared anti-constitutional and the competent authorities have established the dominant positions of RAI and the three television channels of Mediaset. An illustration of this situation was a recent decree of the Prime Minister, approved by Parliament, which allowed the third channel of RAI and Mediaset’s Retequattro to continue their operations in violation of the existing antitrust limits until the adoption of new legislation. Competition in the media sector is further distorted by the fact that the advertising company of Mediaset, Publitalia ’80, has a dominant position in television advertising. The Assembly deplores the continued exclusion of a potential national broadcaster, Europa 7, winner of a 1999 government tender to broadcast on frequencies occupied by Mediaset’s channel, Retequattro.",
                "6. The Assembly believes that the newly-adopted ‘Gasparri Law’ on the reform of the broadcasting sector may not effectively guarantee greater pluralism simply through the multiplication of television channels in the course of digitalisation. At the same time, it manifestly allows Mediaset to expand even further, as it gives the market players the possibility to have a monopoly in a given sector without ever reaching the antitrust limit in the overall integrated system of communications (SIC). The Assembly notes that these concerns led the President of the Republic to oppose the previous version of the law.",
                "7. The Assembly is particularly concerned by the situation of RAI, which is contrary to the principles of independence laid down in Assembly Recommendation 1641 (2004) on public-service broadcasting. RAI has always been a mirror of the political system of the country and its internal pluralism has moved from the proportionate representation of the dominant political ideologies in the past to the winner-takes-all attitude reflecting the present political system. The Assembly notes with concern the resignations of the President of RAI and of one of the most popular journalists in the country in protest against the lack of balanced political representation in the Council of Administration and against the political influence over RAI’s programming.",
                "8. While the printed media in Italy has traditionally provided greater pluralism and political balance than the broadcasting sector, most Italians receive their news through the medium of television. The high cost of newspaper compared to television advertising is having a damaging effect on the Italian printed media. However, the Assembly wishes to record its approval of government measures to help small- and medium-sized newspapers and other measures to boost newspaper readership.",
                "9. The Assembly is extremely concerned that the negative image that Italy is portraying internationally because of the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi, could hamper the efforts of the Council of Europe aimed at promoting independent and unbiased media in the new democracies. It considers that Italy, as one of the strongest contributors to the functioning of the Organisation, has a particular responsibility in this respect.",
                "10. The Assembly points out that several international bodies, such as the OSCE representative on Freedom of the Media and, most recently, the European Parliament, have expressed concerns similar to its own. It welcomes the measures for safeguarding media pluralism proposed in the European Parliament resolution on the risks of violation, in the European Union and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) of 22 April 2004, namely that the protection of media diversity should become a priority of European Union competition law.",

                "While the case-law of the European Court on Human Rights does not offer specific guidance on the matter, certain pertinent principles may nonetheless be derived from that case-law: in primis that freedom of expression has a fundamental role in a democratic society, in particular where, through the press, it serves to impart information and ideas of general interest, which the public is moreover entitled to receive, and that the State is the ultimate guarantor of pluralism, especially in relation to audio-visual media, whose programmes are often broadcast very widely.",
                "Media pluralism is achieved when there is a multiplicity of autonomous and independent media at the national, regional and local levels, ensuring a variety of media content reflecting different political and cultural views. In the Commission’s opinion, internal pluralism must be achieved in each media sector at the same time: it would not be acceptable, for example, if pluralism were guaranteed in the print-media sector, but not in the television one. Plurality of the media does not only mean, in the Commission’s view, the existence of a plurality of actors and outlets, it also means the existence of a wide range of media, that is to say different kinds of media.",
                "The Council of Europe instruments set out certain tools for promoting media pluralism, which include:",
                "– a legislative framework establishing limits for media concentration; the instruments for achieving this include permissible thresholds (to be measured on the basis of one or of a combination of elements such as the audience share or the capital share or revenue limits) which a single media company is allowed to control in one or more relevant markets;",

                "– self-regulatory instruments such as editorial guidelines and statutes setting out editorial independence.",
                "In respect of the provisions in the Gasparri Law aiming at protecting media pluralism, the Commission considers at the outset that the mere increase in the number of channels which will be brought about by digital television is not sufficient in itself to guarantee media pluralism. Newly available channels may have very small audiences but with similar amounts of output. Finally, larger companies will enjoy greater purchasing power in a wide range of activities such as programme acquisitions, and will thus enjoy significant advantages over other national content providers.",
                "The Commission considers therefore that the threshold of 20% of the channels is not a clear indicator of market share. It should be combined, for instance, with an audience share indicator.",
                "As regards the second threshold set out in the Gasparri Law, that is 20% of the revenue in the Integrated Communications Systems (SIC), the Commission considers that SIC certainly reflects a modern trend but should not, at least in this very broad definition, be used already at this stage instead of the ‘relevant market’ criterion, as its effect is to dilute the effectiveness of the instruments aimed at protecting pluralism. Indeed, it may allow an individual company to enjoy extremely high degrees of revenue shares in individual markets, whilst at the same time remaining below the 20% threshold for the whole sector.",
                "Indeed, the Commission notes that the combined effect of the new framework set out in the Gasparri Law has relaxed the previous anti-concentration rules whose maximum permissible levels had been exceeded by Mediaset and RAI. Retequattro has accordingly been allowed to continue to occupy analogue frequencies.",
                "The Commission considers therefore that the SIC criterion should be replaced by the previously used ‘relevant market’ criterion, as is the case in the other European countries.",
                "As regards the provisions on migration of radio and television broadcasters from analogue to digital frequencies, the Commission has the impression that the Gasparri Law has taken the approach of attempting to hold back on finding a real solution to the problem of media concentration in the television market until some future point in time and it relies heavily on the point when digitalisation will come into full effect. In the Commission’s view, this approach is not satisfactory, as, if the status quo is maintained, it is likely that Mediaset and RAI will remain the dominant actors in Italian television. In this respect, the Commission recalls that while general anti-trust measures [are aimed] against the abuse of dominant positions, in the media sector dominant positions are forbidden as such.",
                "In respect of the privatisation of RAI, which should lead to a lesser degree of politicisation of the public broadcaster, the Commission notes that change at RAI will allow for government control over the public broadcaster for an unforeseeable period of time. For as long as the present government stays in office, this will mean that, in addition to being in control of its own three national television channels, the Prime Minister will have some control of the three public national television channels. The Commission expresses concern over the risk that this atypical situation may even strengthen the threat of monopolisation, which might constitute, in terms of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, an unjustified interference with freedom of expression.",

The duopoly was accompanied by a practical monopoly by Mediaset in the commercial television sector and the advertisement market. Before digitalisation, the duopoly’s audience share was around 90% (both owned three channels). Combined revenues and the advertisement market also provided evidence of the duopoly.",
                "Italy also has an ongoing record of control over public-service television by political parties and governments. As its Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi co-owns Mediaset, the usual fears of governmental control of RAI are aggravated by worries of widespread governmental control of the nation’s most important source of information, television.",

However, neither universal digitalisation nor equal competition rules alone can guarantee cultural diversity and political pluralism in the media, especially if the already existing media concentration is practically maintained or even enhanced by the law. The Gasparri Law’s rules of transition from analogue to digital, despite their innovative force, allow the duopoly to use its acquired economic might to expand into new digital markets.",

This de facto situation does not therefore guarantee respect for external pluralism of information, which is an essential requirement laid down by the relevant constitutional case-law ... In this context, given the continued existence (and aggravation) of the situation which was ruled illegal by Judgment no. 420 in 1994 and of networks considered ‘surplus’ by the 1997 legislature, a final deadline must be set that is absolutely certain, definitive and hence absolutely binding in order to ensure compatibility with constitutional rules; notes that, nonetheless, the deadline for the reform of the audio-visual sector has not been respected and that the law for the reform of the audio-visual sector has been sent back by the President of the Republic for a new examination by the Parliament due to the non-respect of the principles declared by the Constitutional Court;",

It notes in this connection that in 2005 the Consiglio di Stato decided to suspend its examination of the applicant company’s appeal and asked the ECJ to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty on freedom to provide services and competition, Directive 2002/21/EC (“the Framework Directive”), Directive 2002/20/EC (“the Authorisation Directive”), Directive 2002/77/EC (“the Competition Directive”) and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in so far as Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union referred to it (see paragraph 32 above). The ECJ held that it was not necessary to rule on the question of Article 10 of the Convention since its answer concerning Article 49 EC and, from the date on which they had become applicable, Article 9 § 1 of the Framework Directive, Article 5 § 1, the second subparagraph of Article 5 § 2 and Article 7 § 3 of the Authorisation Directive and Article 4 of the Competition Directive enabled the national court to rule on the application made by the applicant company (see paragraph 34 above)."

There is no indication in the decisions in question that, as well as having caused damage, the authorities’ conduct contravened the principles established by the Court in relation to freedom of expression or the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, or both.

All the material in the Court’s possession indicates that it was the applicant company alone, as a legal entity, which took part in the call for tenders and was granted a television-broadcasting licence; furthermore, all the decisions of the Italian courts during the domestic proceedings concerned the applicant company alone (see Meltex Ltd and Movsesyan, cited above, § 67).

Freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues and on other subjects of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, for example, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Lingens, cited above, §§ 41-42)."

This is true also where the position of dominance is held by a State or public broadcaster.

The licence authorised it to install and operate an analogue television network (see paragraph 9 above). The Italian administrative courts found that this did not confer on the applicant company a personal right ( diritto soggettivo ) to be allocated broadcasting frequencies but only a legitimate interest ( interesse legittimo ), that is, an individual position indirectly protected as far as was consistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the applicant company’s sole entitlement was to have its request for frequencies dealt with by the Government in a manner consistent with the criteria laid down by domestic law and the ECJ (see the Regional Administrative Court’s judgment of 16 September 2004, paragraph 25 above, and the Consiglio di Stato ’s decision no. 2622/08 of 31 May 2008, paragraph 37 above)."

Provided that it upgraded its installations as it was required to do, the applicant company should then have been entitled to transmit television programmes (see paragraph 145 above). It therefore had a “legitimate expectation” in that regard. It is true that, as the Government noted, the administrative courts refused the applicant company’s requests to be allocated frequencies.

Changes in the market since 1999 should therefore be taken into consideration.

Firstly, the interference with the applicant company’s exercise of its right to impart information and ideas within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention resulting from legislative measures which did not satisfy either the foreseeability requirement or the State’s obligation to guarantee effective pluralism (see paragraph 156 above). Secondly, the applicant company could legitimately have expected the authorities, within the twenty-four months following 28 July 1999, to take the necessary legal measures to regulate its television-broadcasting activities, thereby enabling it to transmit programmes (see paragraph 175 above). For the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that expectation constituted a “possession” (see paragraph 179 above), the use of which was controlled by the same laws found to have been insufficiently foreseeable in relation to Article 10 (see paragraph 188 above). However, the Court has not examined whether the regulations in issue were “in accordance with the general interest” (see paragraph 189 above) and whether the interference with the applicant company’s right to impart information and ideas pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society for achieving that aim (see paragraph 158 above)."

Aspects that may be taken into account include the company’s reputation, uncertainty in decision-planning, disruption in the management of the company (for which there is no precise method of calculating the consequences) and lastly, albeit to a lesser degree, the anxiety and inconvenience caused to the members of the management team (see Comingersoll S.A. v.

However, the Court notes that in the present case the applicant company complained mainly of the manner in which the national courts interpreted and applied domestic law in proceedings between two rival claimants to the same name, it being contended in particular that the courts wrongly gave retrospective effect to the Bilateral Agreement, rather than of the retrospective application of a law which deprived them of their pre-existing possessions. The Court observes that, even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies, the obligations of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right of property. In particular, the State is under an obligation to afford the parties to the dispute judicial procedures which offer the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly in the light of the applicable law. However, the Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see García Ruiz v.

Belgium, 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332). The reason for this is that in the present case the very question whether the legislation was retrospectively applied is in itself in issue whereas, in the above - mentioned cases, not only was the retrospective effect of the legislation indisputable, it was also intentional. Indeed, it has not been established that the applicant company had a right of priority in respect of the “ Budweiser ” mark when the Bilateral Agreement, which is alleged to have been applied retrospectively, came into force. In this connection, the Court points out that the only effective registration in existence when the Bilateral Agreement took effect on 7 March 1987 was of the appellations of origin that had been registered in Budějovický Budvar ’ s name under the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1 958. While it is true that that registration was subsequently cancelled (see paragraph 18 above), the Court cannot examine what consequences the cancellation of the registration had on the right of priority attached to the mark."

Confronted with the conflicting arguments of two private parties concerning the right to use the name “Budweiser” as a trade mark or appellation of origin, the Supreme Court reached its decision on the basis of the material it considered relevant and sufficient for the resolution of the dispute, after hearing representations from the interested parties.

The applicant company alleges that Budějovický Budvar has only been marketing beer under the “Budweiser” name since 1895, whereas Budějovický Budvar says that it has been entitled to use that appellation since 1265, when King Ottakar II of Bohemia conferred the right to produce the beer on a number of independent brewers in České Budějovice ( Budweis in German ). The brewers used a special technique and beers produced by this method became known by the term “ Budweiser ”, just as beers produced using the methods of another Czech town, Plzeň ( Pilsen in German ), became known as “ Pilsner ”."

The Court of First Instance noted that under the terms of the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1958 such protection was reserved to the geographical name of a country, region, or locality, which served to designate a product originating therein, the quality and characteristics of which were due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors. “ Budweiser ” did not come within this category.

The applicant company also alleged that, in any event, the protected appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ” did not correspond to the German expression “ Budweiser ”, so that the Bilateral Agreement could not be used to challenge its application for registration. The applicant company argued that, even supposing that the German expression “ Budweiser ” was an accurate translation of the Czech appellation of origin, the Bilateral Agreement applied only to translations between Portuguese and Czech, not to translations into other languages.

An application for registration constituted a pecuniary interest that benefited from a degree of legal protection (see paragraphs 43 and 45-48 of the Chamber judgment)."

Thus, for instance, the hope that a long-extinguished property right might be revived could not be regarded as a “possession” and the same applied to a conditional claim which had lapsed as a result of a failure to fulfil the condition ( see paragraph 49 of the Chamber judgment)."

With regard to the instant case, the Chamber noted that the applicant company could not be sure of being the owner of the trade mark in question until after final registration and then only on condition that no third party had raised an objection, as the applicable legislation permitted. In other words, the applicant company had a conditional right, which however was extinguished retrospectively for failure to satisfy the condition, namely that it did not infringe third-party rights. The Chamber therefore concluded that while it was clear that a trade mark constituted a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this was so only after final registration of the mark, in accordance with the rules in force in the State concerned. Prior to such registration, the applicant did, of course, have a hope of acquiring such a “possession”, but not a legally protected legitimate expectation. Accordingly, when the Bilateral Agreement came into force on 7 March 1987 the applicant company did not have a “possession”. The manner in which the Bilateral Agreement had been applied by the Portuguese courts could not, therefore, constitute interference with a right of the applicant company ( see paragraphs 50-52 of the Chamber judgment )."

It submitted that the Chamber had, however, failed to draw the logical conclusions from its reasoning relating to the financial interests at stake in an application for registration. It argued that an application for registration had a pecuniary value and was therefore a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as, under the Court ’ s case -law, the concept of “possessions”, which had an autonomous meaning, was not limited to the ownership of physical goods but included certain other rights and interests that constituted assets."

The applicant company referred in that connection to Iatridis v.

In accordance with the priority rule, one of the characteristic features of the property rights bound up in an application for registration of a trade mark was a legitimate expectation that the application would not be defeated by a third - party intellectual property right that arose after the application for registration was filed. The applicant company possessed such a legitimate expectation, as indeed the dissenting judges had acknowledged in their opinion appended to the Chamber judgment. The Chamber ’ s findings were also incompatible with the Court ’ s previous case-law on the concept of legitimate expectation, as had been expounded for instance in Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

That interference with its rights was not provided for by law, since the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement was erroneous and contrary to the general principles of international law. The Portuguese courts had wrongly ruled that the Bilateral Agreement afforded protection of the appellations of origin referred to in Appendix A against translations of the names concerned into any other language, when in fact the Agreement only covered translations into Portuguese and Czech.

Furthermore, the interference was disproportionate as it had failed to strike the requisite fair balance between the general interest and the right of individuals. It also pointed out in that connection that it had not received any compensation for the loss of the use of its mark, despite the fact that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify the lack of payment. Furthermore, conflicts between trade marks and indications of source were now commonplace and the means were available under international law to resolve them satisfactorily. The Supreme Court ’ s decision to give the 1986 Bilateral Agreement precedence over the prior application to register the “ Budweiser” mark was contrary to international law, in particular the TRIPs Agreement and the relevant Community directives."

In that connection, the Government stressed that when the Bilateral Agreement between Portugal and the Czech Republic was signed in 1986, only Budějovický Budvar was entitled to use the term “ Budweiser ” ( as an appellation of origin ). Budějovický Budvar had, moreover, immediately contested the NIIP ’ s decision in 1995 to register the mark and had gone on to win the proceedings. The Government therefore argued that the applicant company had at no stage during that period been able to claim any “legitimate expectation” that would have entitled it to the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In point of fact, such dealings were generally the result of a dispute between two companies over an application to register a mark with the transfer of the application serving to settle the dispute. In the Government ’ s submission, that practice tended to support the view that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was not applicable to such applications."

In any event, the interference was provided for by law, namely the Bilateral Agreement of 1986, which formed part of Portuguese domestic law. It also pursued a legitimate aim: the Portuguese courts ’ decision under the Bilateral Agreement was primarily intended to ensure compliance with domestic law, particularly as it concerned the Portuguese State ’ s international obligations, but also to avoid risks of confusion over a product ’ s source. The Government observed in that connection that, although the Portuguese courts had not relied on Article 189 § 1 (l) of the Code of Industrial Property as a basis for refusing registration of the mark, it was apparent from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment that it had also taken into account in its reasoning the risk of confusion with the Czech appellation of origin. The Government added that any interference there may have been had been entirely proportionate. Noting that the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation when it came to defining the public interest, the Government observed that the State was entitled to determine the conditions under which a trade mark would be eligible for registration. In particular, it was at liberty to decide that third-party interests should be protected, under a procedure provided for by law. In the present case, the domestic courts had merely interpreted and applied the relevant domestic legislation.

However, the Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999- I)."

                "84. The Court notes, firstly, that the instant case is distinguishable from the cases in which it found that there had been retrospective intervention by the legislature in relation to a party ’ s proprietary right ( see, as the most recent authorities, Maurice and Lecarpentier, cited above; see also Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332). The reason for this is that in the present case the very question whether the legislation was retrospectively applied is in itself in issue whereas, in the above - mentioned cases, not only was the retrospective effect of the legislation indisputable, it was also intentional. Indeed, it has not been established that the applicant company had a right of priority in respect of the “ Budweiser ” mark when the Bilateral Agreement, which is alleged to have been applied retrospectively, came into force. In this connection, the Court points out that the only effective registration in existence when the Bilateral Agreement took effect on 7 March 1987 was of the appellations of origin that had been registered in Budějovický Budvar ’ s name under the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1 958. While it is true that that registration was subsequently cancelled (see paragraph 18 above), the Court cannot examine what consequences the cancellation of the registration had on the right of priority attached to the mark."

In the absence of any arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness, the Court cannot call into question the findings of the Supreme Court on this point."

It would merely note here that the applicant company was afforded the opportunity, throughout the proceedings in the Portuguese courts, to indicate how it interpreted both that Agreement and the other legislation it considered applicable to its case and to inform the Portuguese courts of the solution it considered best adapted to the legal issue raised by the case. Confronted with the conflicting arguments of two private parties concerning the right to use the name “Budweiser” as a trade mark or appellation of origin, the Supreme Court reached its decision on the basis of the material it considered relevant and sufficient for the resolution of the dispute, after hearing representations from the interested parties. The Court finds no basis on which to conclude that the decision of the Supreme Court was affected by any element of arbitrariness or that it was otherwise manifestly unreasonable."

Ireland, cited above, § 229). In determining whether an interference was “necessary in a democratic society” the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the national authorities, whose decision remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 41 )."

H. and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 94; and Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 67, ECHR 2014). Where a particularly important facet of an individual ’ s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will normally be restricted (see Evans, cited above, § 77). Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see Evans, cited above, § 77; and A, B and C v.

On the other hand, it has been established that the minor [T.C.] is neither the biological son of Donatina Paradiso, nor, given the evidence of the expert report, of Giovanni Campanelli. At the present time the only certainty is the identity of the woman who gave birth to the baby. The biological parents of the baby, that is, the man and the woman who provided the gametes, remain unknown.",
                "In the light of this evidence, the present case cannot be viewed as a case of so-called gestational surrogacy, which is the case where the surrogate mother who gives birth to the baby has no genetic link to him or her, the fertilisation having taken place with the egg(s) of a third woman. Indeed, in order to be able to talk of gestational or traditional surrogacy (in the latter, the surrogate mother makes her own ovules available) there must be a biological link between the child and at least one of the two intended parents (in this specific case, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso), a biological link which, as has been seen, is non-existent.”",
                "In the court ’ s view, the applicants had thus placed themselves in an unlawful situation:",
                "“It follows that by bringing a baby to Italy, passing him off as their own son, in blatant infringement of the provisions of our legislation (Law no. 184 of 4 May 1983) governing inter-country adoption of children, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso have acted unlawfully. Besides any criminal offences which may have been committed (infringement of section 72(2) of Law no. 184/1983), which are not within the jurisdiction of this court, it is noted that the agreement entered into between Mrs Paradiso and the company Rosjurconsulting had unlawful elements since, given the terms of the agreement (the delivery of Mr Campanelli ’ s genetic material for the fertilisation of another woman ’ s ovules), it was in breach of the ban on the use of assisted reproductive technology (A.R.T.) of a heterologous type laid down by section 4 of Law no. 40 of 19 February 2004.",
                "In any event, it is pointed out that despite being in possession of the authorisation for inter-country adoption issued by order of this court on 7 December 2006, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso, as has been stated, intentionally evaded the provisions of Law no. 184/1983, which provide not only that the intended adoptive parents must apply to an authorised body (section 31) but also for the involvement of the Commission for Inter-country Adoption (section 38), the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of a foreign child in Italy (section 32).”",
                "The court therefore found it necessary, first and foremost, to put an end to this unlawful situation:",
                "“It is therefore necessary, above all, to prevent this unlawful situation from continuing, since to maintain it would be equivalent to ratifying unlawful conduct in open violation of the provisions of our legislation.",
                "Accordingly, it is necessary to remove the minor child from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso and place him in an appropriate structure with a view to identifying a suitable couple to foster the child as soon as possible. The Social Services Department of the Municipality of Colletorto is therefore instructed to identify an appropriate structure and to place the child in it. The Italian legislation on adoption applies to this child in accordance with section 37a of Law No. 184/1983, there being no doubt that he is in Italy in a state of abandonment, having been deprived of his biological parents and other relatives, and the mother who gave birth to him having renounced him.",
                "Admittedly, it cannot be denied that the child will in all likelihood suffer harm from being separated from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso. However, given the age of the child and the short time he has spent with them, the court cannot agree with the conclusions of the report by psychologist [Dr I.] ( instructed by Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso), finding that it is certain that the child ’ s separation from them would entail devastating consequences. Indeed, according to the literature on this subject, the mere separation from the main care-givers is not a causal agent of a psychopathological state in a child unless other causal factors are present. The trauma caused by the separation from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso will not be irreparable, given that a search will begin immediately for a couple able to attenuate the consequences of the trauma, through a compensatory process that will encourage a new adaptation.",
                "It is also pointed out that the fact that Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso (and in particular Mrs Paradiso) have put up with the hardships and the difficulties of A.R.T (Mrs Paradiso has also stated that during one of these interventions her life was at risk) and have preferred, despite being in possession of an approval for inter-country adoption, to circumvent Italian legislation on this subject gives rise to the doubt and the fear that the minor child may be an instrument to fulfil a narcissistic desire of Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso or to exorcise an individual or joint problem. In the light of the conduct of Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso during the events under examination, all of this throws a consistent shadow over their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities and of the instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children.",
                "The separation of the minor child from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso thus corresponds to the best interests of the child.”"

The Court of Appeal also considered that section 33 of Law no. 218/95 (the Private International Law Act) did not prevent the Italian courts from refusing to comply with certified information from a foreign State, and that there was no issue of lack of jurisdiction, since, according to section 37 bis of the Adoption Act, “ ... the Italian law governing adoption, fostering, and necessary measures in case of urgency shall be applicable to a foreign minor child who is in [Italy] in a state of abandonment” (cf. also Cass 1128/92)”."

In particular, the court noted the following facts: the first applicant had spread a rumour that she was pregnant; she had gone to the Italian Consulate in Moscow and implied that she was the natural mother; she had subsequently admitted that the child had been born to a surrogate mother; she had stated to the carabinieri on 25 May 2011 that the second applicant was the biological father, which had been disproved by the DNA tests; she had thus made false statements; she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother; the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the two applicants had been seen by the Russian doctors, which did not correspond to the fact that the second applicant had not travelled to Russia; the documents relating to the birth did not give any precise date. The court considered that the only certainty was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of almost 50,000 euros (EUR). In the court ’ s view, the hypothesis that the applicants had behaved illegally with a view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the civil ‑ status register and to circumventing the Italian legislation thus appeared well-founded."

In the Public Prosecutor ’ s view, there was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child, and his temporary placement with a foster family had therefore been requested, in accordance with sections 8 and 10 of the Adoption Act. The Public Prosecutor repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed more than a year previously, and that he had since been living in a children ’ s home ( casa famiglia ), where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for his care. He explained that the child had thus still not found a family environment to replace the one that had been illegally provided by the couple who had brought him to Italy. According to the Public Prosecutor, the child seemed destined for another separation, even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and then from the woman who claimed to be his mother.",

The Court of Cassation held that the decision to take the child into care was lawful. Having noted the absence of genetic links between the child and the intended parents, the Court of Cassation concluded that the impugned situation was illegal under Ukrainian law, since the latter required a biological link with one of the intended parents. The Court of Cassation reiterated that the prohibition on surrogate motherhood was still in force in Italy. It explained that the prohibition on surrogate motherhood in Italian law was a criminal-law one, and was intended to protect the surrogate mother ’ s human dignity and the practice of adoption. It added that only a legally recognised adoption, organised in accordance with the regulations, would allow non-genetic parenthood to be validated. It stated that the assessment of the child ’ s best interests had been carried out in advance by the legislature, and the court had no discretion in this matter. It concluded that there could be no conflict of interest with the child ’ s interests where the court applied the domestic law and refused to take into account a legal parent-child relationship established abroad following a gestational surrogacy arrangement.",

Ukrainian law required that one of the two parents be the biological parent. The acquittal judgment delivered at first instance had been challenged by the public prosecutor before the Court of Cassation. That court dismissed the public prosecutor ’ s appeal on points of law, thus confirming the acquittal, which had been based on the finding that the defendants had not been in breach of section 12 § 6 of Law no. 40 of 19 February 2004 (the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act), given that they had had recourse to an assisted reproduction technique which was legal in the country in which it was practised. In addition, the Court of Cassation considered that the fact that the defendants had submitted a foreign birth certificate to the Italian authorities did not constitute the offence of “making a false statement as to identity” (Article 495 of the Criminal Code) or “falsifying civil status” (Article 567 of the Criminal Code), since the certificate in question was legal under the law of the issuing country."

One of them was the “mother” under Italian law, and the seminal fluid had been provided by an unknown donor. The claimant had been successful at first and second instance. On an appeal by the public prosecutor, the Court of Cassation dismissed the latter ’ s submissions, and thus accepted that a child born through assisted reproduction techniques within a same-sex female couple could be adopted by the woman who had not given birth to that child. In reaching that conclusion the Court of Cassation took into account the stable emotional bond between the claimant and the child, and the best interests of the minor child.

The Chamber based its reasoning on the principle that the removal of a child from the family setting is an extreme measure to which recourse should be had only as a very last resort, to fulfil the aim of protecting a child who is faced with immediate danger (in this regard, the Chamber referred to the following judgments: Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 148, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII; Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, § 136, ECHR 2010; Y.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 4547/10, §§ 133-138, 13 March 2012; and Pontes v. Portugal, no. 19554/09, §§ 74-80, 10 April 2012). On the basis of the evidence in the file, the Chamber held that the national courts had taken decisions without any specific assessment of the child ’ s living conditions with the applicants, and of his best interests. Accordingly, it concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on the ground that the national authorities had failed to strike the fair balance that ought to be maintained between the general interest and the private interests at stake (see §§ 75-87 of the Chamber judgment)."

The applicants stated at the outset that the Court was required to rule solely on the disputed measures taken by the Italian authorities in respect of the child, and then only on the basis of Article 8 of the Convention, for the purpose of determining whether there had been a violation of the applicants ’ private and family life. In their view, given the Chamber ’ s decision to declare inadmissible the complaint concerning the refusal to register the child ’ s Russian birth certificate in Italy, the Court was not required to rule on whether a State ’ s decisions to authorise or prohibit the practice of gestational surrogacy on its territory, or the conditions for recognition of a parent-child relationship in respect of children legally conceived in another country, were compatible with the Convention."

It was therefore based on a legal tie of lawful parenthood, attested by the birth certificate issued by the competent authorities. The lawfulness of this legal parent-child tie was not affected by the fact that it had transpired that there was no biological father-child relationship binding the intended father and the child, since the presence of such a biological tie had not been required by Russian law at the time."

The couple had demonstrated their attachment to the child even before his birth (the applicants referred to Anayo v. Germany, no. 20578/07, § 61, 21 December 2010) and had taken steps to make an effective family life possible. The applicants stated that, following the child ’ s birth, the first applicant had rapidly taken him into her care and had taken up residence with him in a flat in Moscow, forming strong emotional bonds. On his arrival in Italy, the child lived with the applicants in an environment which, both materially and emotionally, was welcoming, secure and conducive to his harmonious development. The applicants pointed out that the family had lived together for eight months, including six months in Italy. Although this period was relatively short, it corresponded to the first important stages in the child ’ s young life. The applicants also pointed out that the shortness of the period in question had not resulted from any decision on their part, given that the abrupt termination of their cohabitation arose solely from the measures taken by the Italian authorities."

In any event, the clinic ’ s error entailed no legal consequences with regard to the lawfulness of the parent-child relationship established in Russia since, at the relevant time, Russian law did not require that intended parents provide their own genetic material. Accordingly, under the applicable rules at the time, the gestational surrogacy arrangement entered into by the applicants was entirely legal under Russian law. The applicants submitted that it had only been since 1 January 2012, when Federal Law no. 323 FZ of 21 November 2011 entered into force, that intended parents were forbidden from using a gamete provider."

In their opinion, that interference had a formal basis in law, as the impugned measures had been taken under the provisions of the Italian Adoption Act. However, these measures resulted from an arbitrary analysis by the domestic courts, in so far as they had concluded that the child had been “in a state of abandonment”. The applicants also submitted that although the practice of gestational surrogacy was prohibited by the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act (sections 6 and 14), criminal proceedings had nonetheless never been taken against surrogate mothers or intended parents. In the absence of an extraterritoriality clause, gestational surrogacy arrangements entered into legally in another State could not, in their view, be prosecuted in the Italian courts. Given that it was impossible to prosecute gestational surrogacy as such, other provisions were used as the basis for criminal proceedings. This was the case for the applicants, who had faced prosecution since 5 May 2011 for falsifying civil status (Article 567 of the Criminal Code), use of falsified documents (Article 489 of the Criminal Code) and breach of the provisions of the Adoption Act."

The Italian courts had based their decisions exclusively on the illegality of the situation created by the applicants and had confined themselves to asserting – with no regard to the Russian legislation – that the surrogacy arrangement in Russia had been contrary to Italian law. Thus, the primary aim of the Minors Court had been to prevent the continuation of the illegal situation. The applicants considered that the decisions of that court indicated solely a wish to punish them for their conduct. The child ’ s interests were mentioned merely to assert that the impact of the impugned measures on him would be minimal."

As to the necessity of those measures, the applicants noted that although recourse to a surrogacy arrangement raised sensitive ethical questions, that consideration was not a valid ground for a “carte blanche justifying any measure”. Although the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in authorising or prohibiting the practice of gestational surrogacy arrangements on their territory, they considered that this was not the subject of the present application. The Court was required in the present case to determine whether the measures resulting in the child ’ s irreversible removal had struck a fair balance between the interests at stake, namely those of the applicants, those of the child, and those of public order. From that standpoint, the applicants considered it appropriate to bear in mind that in all decisions concerning a child, his or her best interests ought to be the primary consideration. Thus, the immediate and irremediable severing of family ties had been held to be consistent with Article 8 only in circumstances where the children concerned were exposed to serious and sustained risks to their health and wellbeing. However, that had not been the situation here, according to the applicants, who submitted that the child ’ s best interests had not been taken into consideration by the national authorities at any point."

These measures had destroyed the family unit ’ s existence and had led to an irreversible severing of family ties, with irremediable consequences, in the absence of circumstances justifying that outcome. The Minors Court had refrained from examining the actual conditions of the child ’ s life, and had presumed that he was deprived of emotional or material support from the parents. In the applicants ’ view, the domestic courts had expressed doubt as to their emotional and educative capabilities solely on the basis of the unlawfulness of their conduct, and had held that they had resorted to a gestational surrogacy arrangement on account of their narcissism. The applicants pointed out, however, that they had previously been assessed as fit to become adoptive parents by those same authorities. Moreover, the social workers, acting on an instruction by the Minors Court, had drawn up a report that was highly favourable to continuation of joint life with the child. There had been clear inadequacies in the decision-making process which led to the contested measures. Thus, the applicants considered that they had been held to be incapable of bringing up and loving the child solely on the basis of presumptions and inferences, without any expert report having been ordered by the courts."

In spite of the absence of a biological tie and of a parental relationship that was legally recognised by the respondent State, the Court has found that there existed family life between the foster parents who had cared for a child on a temporary basis and the child in question, on account of the close personal ties between them, the role played by the adults vis ‑ à ‑ vis the child, and the time spent together (see Moretti and Benedetti v. Italy, no. 16318/07, § 48, 27 April 2010, and Kopf and Liberda v. Austria, no. 1598/06, § 37, 17 January 2012 ). In the case of Moretti and Benedetti, the Court attached importance to the fact that the child had arrived in the family at the age of one month and that, for nineteen months, the applicants had shared the first important stages of his young life with the child. It also noted that the court-ordered reports on the family showed that the child was well integrated in the family and deeply attached to the applicants and to their children. The applicants had also provided for the child ’ s social development. These elements were sufficient for the Court to find that there existed between the applicants and the child a close inter-personal bond and that the applicants behaved in every respect as her parents, so that “ de facto ” “family ties” existed between them (see Moretti and Benedetti, cited above, §§ 49-50). The Kopf and Liberda case concerned a foster family which had cared, over a period of about forty-six months, for a child who had arrived in their home at the age of two. Here too the Court concluded that family life existed, given that the applicants had a genuine concern for the child ’ s well-being and that an emotional bond had developed between the individuals concerned (see Kopf and Liberda, cited above, § 37)."

In the above-cited case of Wagner and J.M.W.L ., the cohabitation had lasted for more than ten years.

The Italian authorities reacted rapidly to this situation by requesting the suspension of parental authority and opening proceedings to make the child available for adoption (see paragraphs 22-23 above).

In the case of S.H. and Others v.

Accordingly, what is at issue is the right to respect for the applicants ’ decision to become parents (see S.H. and Others v.

In addition, having regard to the fact that the applicants had preferred to circumvent the Adoption Act in spite of the authorisation obtained by them, it could be thought that the child resulted from a narcissistic desire on the part of the couple or that he was intended to resolve problems in their relationship. In consequence, the court expressed doubts as to the applicants ’ genuine affective and educational abilities."

In addition, the present case does not concern the choice to become genetic parents, an area in which the State ’ s margin of appreciation is restricted (see Dickson, cited above, § 78). Nonetheless, even where, as here, the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, the solutions reached are not beyond the scrutiny of the Court. It is for the latter to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration when reaching the impugned decision and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of the State and those of the individuals directly affected by the decision (see, mutatis mutandis, S.H. and Others v.

The domestic courts attached considerable weight to the applicants ’ failure to comply with the Adoption Act and to the fact that they had recourse abroad to methods of medically assisted reproduction that are prohibited in Italy. In the domestic proceedings, the courts, focused as they were on the imperative need to take urgent measures, did not expand on the public interests involved; nor did they explicitly address the sensitive ethical issues underlying the legal provisions breached by the applicants."

In the proceedings before the Court, the respondent Government submitted that in Italian law descent may be established either through the existence of a biological relationship or through an adoption respecting the rules set out in the law. They argued that, in making this choice, the Italian legislature was seeking to protect the best interests of the child as required by Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Court accepts that, by prohibiting private adoption based on a contractual relationship between individuals and restricting the right of adoptive parents to introduce foreign minors into Italy to cases in which the rules on international adoption have been respected, the Italian legislature is seeking to protect children against illicit practices, some of which may amount to human trafficking."

There is no doubt that recourse to such an arrangement raises sensitive ethical questions on which no consensus exists among the Contracting States (see Mennesson, cited above, § 79). By prohibiting surrogacy arrangements, Italy has taken the view that it is pursuing the public interest of protecting the women and children potentially affected by practices which it regards as highly problematic from an ethical point of view. This policy is considered very important, as the Government have pointed out, where, as here, commercial surrogacy arrangements are involved. That underlying public interest is also of relevance in respect of measures taken by a State to discourage its nationals from having recourse abroad to such practices which are forbidden on its own territory."

Given the child ’ s young age and the short period spent with the applicants, the court did not agree with the psychologist ’ s report submitted by the applicants, suggesting that the separation would have devastating consequences for the child. Referring to the literature on the subject, it noted that the fact of mere separation from the care-givers, without any other factors being present, would not cause a psychopathological state in a child.

As to the applicants ’ interest in continuing their relationship with the child, the Minors Court had noted that there was no evidence in the file to support their claim that they had provided the Russian clinic with the second applicant ’ s genetic material. Moreover, having obtained approval for inter-country adoption, they had circumvented the Adoption Act by bringing the child to Italy without the approval of the competent body, namely the Commission for Inter-Country Adoption. Having regard to that conduct, the Minors Court expressed concern that the child might be an instrument to fulfil a narcissistic desire of the applicants or to exorcise an individual or joint problem. Furthermore, it considered that the applicants ’ conduct threw a “consistent shadow on their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities” and doubted whether they displayed the “instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children” (see paragraph 37 above)."

In addition, the child was not a member of the applicants ’ family within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. This does not mean however, that the child ’ s best interests and the way in which these were addressed by the domestic courts are of no relevance. In that connection, the Court observes that Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that “in all actions concerning children ... the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”, but does not however define the notion of the “best interests of the child”."

In contrast, the Court does not consider in the present case that the domestic courts were obliged to give priority to the preservation of the relationship between the applicants and the child.

In evaluating the child ’ s specific situation, the courts considered it desirable to place him with a suitable couple with a view to adoption, and also assessed the impact which the separation from the applicants would have.

However, this has to be seen against the background of the illegality of the applicants ’ conduct and the fact that their relationship with the child was precarious from the very moment that they decided to take up residence with him in Italy.

In the Court ’ s view, it has to be borne in mind that the proceedings were of an urgent nature. Any measure prolonging the child ’ s stay with the applicants, such as placing him in their temporary care, would have carried the risk that the mere passage of time would have determined the outcome of the case."

However, the public interests at stake weigh heavily in the balance, while comparatively less weight is to be attached to the applicants ’ interest in their personal development by continuing their relationship with the child. Agreeing to let the child stay with the applicants, possibly with a view to becoming his adoptive parents, would have been tantamount to legalising the situation created by them in breach of important rules of Italian law.

Further, an appellate authority, in this case a superior prosecutor, decides on an appeal on the basis of the facts at the time of its decision, which means including new developments since the time of the challenged decision, and it has a full power of review. Under these circumstances the Court considers that the fact that the prosecutor did not issue a separate decision regarding the funds that came in between 25 April and 28 November 2001 but chose to amend the original seizure order by writing in the sums as they were on the date of its decision does not make that decision an arbitrary or manifestly erroneous application of domestic law.

There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question ( see, for example, Immobiliare Saffi, cited above; Allan Jacobsson v.

The crux of the interference concerns the continuing assessment of a reasonable suspicion that the seized funds originated in criminal activities. The national authorities are clearly in a better position than the Court to evaluate these issues, because they have direct access to the available evidence, which in the present case included thousands of pages of documentary evidence, hundreds of witnesses and transactions of several companies including foreign and offshore companies. Faced with such a complex investigation it is up to the national authorities in the first place to decide whether, and if so what, further investigatory measures are necessary in order to effectively fight this type of serious and carefully premeditated crime."

Consequently, it is not the Court's task to conduct anew a full analysis of whether the interference was proportionate, considering that the national authorities, especially the Constitutional Court itself, performed an analysis of proportionality. The nature and scope of the Court's supervision, mindful of its subsidiary role, is thus to assess whether the interference with the applicant company's property rights was manifestly unreasonable (see Benet Czech, spol. s r.o. v. the Czech Republic, no. 31555/05, § 40, 21 October 2010 )."

It was not thus prima facie unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that the bank accounts of the applicant company would have contained funds from these activities, even in 2001. The Government argued that the investigation so far had led to a conclusion that the accused used the applicant company's bank accounts to save the funds generated by his criminal activities. In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court has no reason to hold that the prosecuting authorities'suspicion about the origin of the seized funds was manifestly unreasonable."

The Court, however, notes that the decisions on the seizure made clear that the funds had been seized on the suspicion that they came from the criminal activities of the former manager and other persons and not to secure payment of any custom or tax debt by the applicant company. Consequently, the seizure was made in the context of criminal proceedings and it was only in these proceedings that the continuing justification of the seizure should have been maintained. Any decision of administrative authorities concerning a debt of the applicant company was thus not directly relevant to the issue whether the funds originated in criminal activities of the applicant company's former manager, and in any case those decisions were not binding on the prosecuting authorities. The Court thus considers that the decisions of the administrative authorities could not have made the seizure ipso facto unjustified."

In this particular context all that the right to adversarial proceedings requires is for the parties to have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on all observations submitted, with a view to influencing the court's decision. In practice it is just a matter of forwarding the observations of one party to the other party and setting a deadline for possible comments.

Portugal ( dec .), no. 49639/09, 3 April 2012 and Jirsák v. the Czech Republic, no. 8968/08, §§ 89-90, 5 April 2012 ). In those cases, the Court based its decision on the fact that the non-communicated observations did not contain anything new or relevant to the case and that the impugned decision had not been based on them. In the present case, the Federal Department of Interior, which had not been heard in the previous proceedings before the administrative authorities, made submissions falling within its own competency as a Federal organ. It does not appear that the Federal Department merely repeated arguments which had already been raised before. It cannot thus be said – and it has not been alleged by the Government – that the submissions were completely irrelevant for the proceedings before the Federal Tribunal. In these circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant has not suffered a “significant disadvantage” in exercising his right to adversarial proceedings before the Federal Tribunal (also compare BENet Praha, spol. s r.o. v. the Czech Republic, no. 33908/04, § 135, 2 4 February 2011)."

The Government referred, in particular, to the judgment issued by the Federal Tribunal on 22 November 2005 (see paragraph 14, above).

In the instant case, the Federal Tribunal had given judgment 26 days after having served the department ’ s submissions on the applicant.

The procedural situation thus resembles the one examined by the Court in the case of Schaller- Bossert. In that case, the Court was not called upon to pronounce an opinion on the impact of the case-law adopted by the Federal Tribunal by judgment of 22 November 2005 (see paragraph 13, above), because this judgment was given only after the relevant proceedings had been terminated (see Schaller- Bossert, cited above, § 41). The Court observed, however, that it was not convinced that the applicant, who was not represented by counsel before the Federal Tribunal, should have replied immediately to the observations in order not to lose her right under Article 6 § 1. In this respect, the Court emphasised that the letter accompanying the observations clearly bore the reference “for information” and that the relevant provisions of the Law on Judicial Organisation unequivocally provided for a further exchange of submissions only under exceptional circumstances (see Schaller- Bossert, cited above, § 42)."

The information on that site was regularly updated to reflect, for example, admission requirements for the current academic year. It also provided up to date information from the Lithuanian Labour Exchange about job vacancies and unemployment (see paragraph 7 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that such information was directly relevant to the applicant ’ s interest in obtaining education, which is in turn of relevance for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into society. As underlined by the CPT, a satisfactory programme of activities, including education, is of crucial importance for the well-being of all detainees, including prisoners awaiting trial. This is all the more relevant in relation to sentenced prisoners (see paragraph 35 above), and the applicant, who was serving a sentence in the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, was one such prisoner (see paragraph 5 above). In fact, as regards the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, the CPT specifically noted after its 2008 visit that steps should be taken to ensure that all sentenced prisoners in that prison were able to engage in purposeful activities of a varied nature, such as educational programmes (see point 49 in fine of the CPT report, quoted in Mironovas and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 40828/12, 29292/12, 69598/12, 40163/13, 66281/13, 70048/13 and 70065/13, § 65, 8 December 2015 )."

The Court also considers that accessing the AIKOS website in the manner advised by the Ministry of Education and Science – namely browsing through it in order to find information that was relevant – was more efficient than making requests for specific information, as was proposed by the Government (see paragraph 4 6 above). Indeed, in order to make a specific request to an educational institution one would need to be aware of the competencies of that institution and the services provided by it. Such preliminary information would be provided by the AIKOS website. The Court furthermore notes the applicant ’ s argument that the information about the study programmes was of a constantly evolving nature (see paragraph 40 above). This fact is also highlighted on the AIKOS website itself (see paragraph 7 above)."

                "61. Turning to the Lithuanian authorities ’ decisions, the Court cannot but observe that they essentially focussed on the legal ban on prisoners having Internet access as such, instead of examining the applicant ’ s argument that access to a particular website was necessary for his education (see paragraphs 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). It is true that the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities pointed out the presence of a secondary school in that prison, as well as the possibility of following computer courses at Elektrėnai vocational school (see paragraph 18 above). However, this appears to be a very remote proposition in relation to the applicant ’ s wish to acquire a second university degree (see paragraph 6 above). In the present case the Court also observes that the prison authorities or the Lithuanian courts did not even go so far as to argue that extended Internet access could incur additional costs for the State (see paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). Whilst the security considerations arising from prisoners ’ access to Internet, as such, and cited by the prison authorities (see paragraph 14 above ) may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts failed to give any kind of consideration to the fact that the applicant asked for access to a website created and administered by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was a State institution. In fact, both courts were completely silent on the matter of education (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above)."

Lastly, the Court is mindful of the fact that in a number of the Council of Europe ’ s and other international instruments the public-service value of the Internet and its importance for the enjoyment of a range of human rights has been recognised. Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to achieve universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” ( see Kalda, cited above, § 52 ). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives, in particular since certain information is exclusively available on Internet. Indeed, as has already been established in this case, the AIKOS website provides comprehensive information about learning possibilities in Lithuania. In this connection it is also noteworthy that the Lithuanian authorities did not even consider a possibility of granting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to this particular website administered by a State institution, which could have hardly posed a security risk."

This holds true for all establishments, whether for sentenced prisoners or those awaiting trial. The CPT has observed that activities in many remand prisons are extremely limited. The organisation of regime activities in such establishments – which have a fairly rapid turnover of inmates – is not a straightforward matter. Clearly, there can be no question of individualised treatment programmes of the sort which might be aspired to in an establishment for sentenced prisoners. However, prisoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells. The CPT considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature. Of course, regimes in establishments for sentenced prisoners should be even more favourable. ”"

The legislation relied on by the Government, namely point 6 of Annex 1 to the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 30 above), which explicitly prohibited prisoners from having telephones and other means of communication such as radios, could not be regarded as formulated with sufficient precision to be foreseeable and therefore as meeting the Court ’ s standards. The fact that none of the legal rules clearly and unambiguously stated that prisoners may not be granted access to the Internet was further supported by the fact that Article 96 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences allowed prisoners to use computers and radios (see paragraph 29 above). The Government themselves stated that the restriction on Internet use by prisoners was only implicit, and was derived systemically from the regime applicable to prisoners per se."

The Ministry, as the official body responsible for providing information about study programmes, had indicated no alternative ways or means for the applicant to obtain that information. The applicant further submitted that information about study programmes and the opportunities for distant studies was of a constantly evolving nature. The educational establishments usually updated such information in the course of the year. Accurate information was therefore only available on the Internet and without Internet access the applicant had no means of obtaining the information necessary to pursue his studies. The applicant lastly pointed out that a number of States permitted limited Internet access in prisons for educational purposes, thus showing that the absolute restriction that existed in Lithuania was disproportionate."

The applicant ’ s complaints had been examined by the domestic courts, which had come to reasoned decisions.

Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information, the Government considered that that interference had had a basis in law. The implicit prohibition of prisoners ’ use of the Internet stemmed from the statutory prohibition of the use of telephones and radios as communication devices, and this had been properly examined by the domestic courts in 2007. Taking into account the technological developments, the Code of the Execution of Sentences had been amended in 2010 in order to explicitly include a prohibition of the use of means of electronic communication by prisoners (see paragraph 31 above)."

As noted by the Supreme Administrative Court, the wide scope of opportunities afforded by the Internet could pose a threat to the rights of other persons. This, in turn, would require “ huge efforts ” by the prison authorities to prevent any such potential illegal acts. The Internet was only one means of receive information, and the prisoners could effectively exercise that right by other means, such as by postal correspondence (letters) via the prison authorities. In the present case, the information which the applicant sought was available in various forms – the information concerning admission to educational institutions is announced in the press, special publications are printed, and such information could also have been imparted by the applicant ’ s relatives. Prisoners may also receive information concerning the possibility of studies in social rehabilitation units or correctional institutions. General and vocational education was organised in Lithuania in prisons so as to guarantee the inmates ’ the right to education, and the applicant had made use of those possibilities whilst serving his sentence (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."

As noted by the Lithuanian courts, the applicant also sought access to his email accounts, whereas the Convention institutions had already accepted that certain limitations as regards prisoners ’ correspondence did not infringe the guarantees of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (the Government relied on the Commission decision in X v. the United Kingdom, no. 5270/72, 8 July 1974)."

The Court notes first of all that before the domestic courts the applicant challenged the decision by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, under whose effective control he was, not to grant him Internet access. For the applicant, such access was indispensable for the purposes of obtaining education - related information (see paragraph 17 above). The Court has also recently observed that an increasing amount of services and information is available only via the Internet (see Kalda v. Estonia, no. 17429/10, § 52, 19 January 2016 ). That being so, and given that the applicant ’ s complaint is construed as concerning the right to receive information – thus falling under Article 10 of the Convention − as opposed to a complaint about the denial of education as such, the Court rejects the Government ’ s objection concerning the failure to properly exhaust the domestic remedies by, firstly, not having written letters to Lithuanian educational institutions in Lithuania and by, secondly, not having pursued court proceedings against the Ministry (see paragraph 41 above). As to the first avenue, it was not even a remedy within the sense of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. As to the second avenue, the Court notes that as a remedy for his grievance of lack of access to information the applicant chose to pursue court proceedings against the Pravieniškės Correctional Home which had effectively barred him from accessing the Ministry ’ s website. In this context the Court recalls that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Leja v. Latvia, no. 71072/01, § 4 6, 14 June 2011 )."

However, in the circumstances of the present case, since access to information relating to education is granted under Lithuanian law (see paragraph 34 above ), the Court is ready to accept that the restriction of access to the Internet site to which the Ministry referred the applicant in reply to his request to provide information constituted an interference with the right to receive information.",

The ban on the use of “ other means of electronic communication ”, which could be understood as also encompassing means providing Internet access, was only introduced in March 2010 in Annex no. 1 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 31 above). Be that as it may, the Court notes that in 2006 numerous domestic legal norms did indeed provide for an explicit ban on telephone and radio communications by prisoners, prohibited the prisoners from working with radio and electronic communication devices, and required that all correspondence by prisoners ’ be conducted in writing and sent by post via the prison authorities (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that all those prohibitions could have been circumvented, if prisoners were allowed access to Internet. The Court therefore does not consider that the applicant was left without an indication that there was a prohibition on the use of the Internet in prison. It therefore concludes that the prohibition on the inmates ’ use of the Internet in prison was “prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.",

This was moreover noted by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, as well as by the administrative courts of two instances (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 19 above).

It also provided up to date information from the Lithuanian Labour Exchange about job vacancies and unemployment (see paragraph 7 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that such information was directly relevant to the applicant ’ s interest in obtaining education, which is in turn of relevance for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into society.

The Court also considers that accessing the AIKOS website in the manner advised by the Ministry of Education and Science – namely browsing through it in order to find information that was relevant – was more efficient than making requests for specific information, as was proposed by the Government (see paragraph 4 6 above). Indeed, in order to make a specific request to an educational institution one would need to be aware of the competencies of that institution and the services provided by it. Such preliminary information would be provided by the AIKOS website. The Court furthermore notes the applicant ’ s argument that the information about the study programmes was of a constantly evolving nature (see paragraph 40 above). This fact is also highlighted on the AIKOS website itself (see paragraph 7 above)."

                "61. Turning to the Lithuanian authorities ’ decisions, the Court cannot but observe that they essentially focussed on the legal ban on prisoners having Internet access as such, instead of examining the applicant ’ s argument that access to a particular website was necessary for his education (see paragraphs 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). It is true that the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities pointed out the presence of a secondary school in that prison, as well as the possibility of following computer courses at Elektrėnai vocational school (see paragraph 18 above). However, this appears to be a very remote proposition in relation to the applicant ’ s wish to acquire a second university degree (see paragraph 6 above). In the present case the Court also observes that the prison authorities or the Lithuanian courts did not even go so far as to argue that extended Internet access could incur additional costs for the State (see paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). Whilst the security considerations arising from prisoners ’ access to Internet, as such, and cited by the prison authorities (see paragraph 14 above ) may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts failed to give any kind of consideration to the fact that the applicant asked for access to a website created and administered by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was a State institution. In fact, both courts were completely silent on the matter of education (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above)."

                "62. Lastly, the Court is mindful of the fact that in a number of the Council of Europe ’ s and other international instruments the public-service value of the Internet and its importance for the enjoyment of a range of human rights has been recognised. Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to achieve universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” ( see Kalda, cited above, § 52 ). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives, in particular since certain information is exclusively available on Internet. Indeed, as has already been established in this case, the AIKOS website provides comprehensive information about learning possibilities in Lithuania. In this connection it is also noteworthy that the Lithuanian authorities did not even consider a possibility of granting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to this particular website administered by a State institution, which could have hardly posed a security risk."

In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that sufficient reasons have been put forward in the present case to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information. Moreover, having regard to the consequences of that interference for the applicant (see paragraphs 59 ‑ 61 above), the Government ’ s objection that the applicant had not suffered significant disadvantage (see paragraph 50 above) must be dismissed."

In another application form which the applicant signed on 28 August 2008, and which the Court received on 12 September 2008, the applicant further complained about the seizure of his computer and the conditions of his detention in Lukiškės Prison. Given that the Supreme Administrative Court adopted a final decision in the set of proceedings concerning these issues on 12 October 2007 (see paragraph 24 above), the Court finds that this complaint has been lodged out of time and is therefore inadmissible, in accordance with Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention."
