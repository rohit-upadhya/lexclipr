                "126. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s son, together with ten others, died in an accident which was caused by the covert production of rocket fuel, which is, per se, a dangerous activity that creates a potentially explosive atmosphere during which a source of ignition may cause an explosion and put people ’ s safety at risk. Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum (see Binişan v. Romania, no. 39438/05, §§ 72-74, 20 May 2014 )."

            [
                "9. Composite fuel, also known as composite propellant, is a broad class of solid chemical fuels that are used as propellants in rockets. The rocket-fuel sheets resemble PVC folia but are less stable and require a specialised location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions. They are composed of fuel and oxidiser. An example of a fuel is phenol formaldehyde and of an oxidiser, ammonium perchlorate (“AP”). AP is a powerful oxidiser, which explains why it is used mainly in solid propellant rocket boosters, including space shuttles and military missiles."
            ],
            [
                "10. AP is a white, granular, crystalline solid or powder. Its explosive characteristics depend on particle size and granulometric composition. It is a class 4 oxidiser (it can cause an explosive reaction) when particles measure over 15 micrometres. It is classified as an explosive when particles measure less than 15 micrometres. It has been apparently involved in a number of accidents. AP is stable when properly stored, transported and handled at temperatures below 150 degrees Celsius ( oC). The amount put in any pile must be limited and storage sites must be designed with blast walls. The risks of explosion and fire associated with AP arise mainly when there is a large proportion of AP in a premix or when it is exposed to intensive heat or an organic compound. When heated to 300 oC, AP degrades organic adhesive, breaking cemented joints. Complete reactions leave no residue."

The latter ’ s experts were supposed to provide the formula and certain components, including oxidisers. Certain Grmeč managers had allegedly been requested to make available a mill with two counter-rotating rollers in its facilities for the production of polyvinyl chloride sheets, as well as other substances and its experts."

The explosion greatly damaged the production room and killed a number of people who had been involved in the production process.",

They were requested to examine the scene two to three steps away from the entrance door for security reasons, given that the damaged roof could have collapsed. The judge noticed that it had been a powerful explosion, and that the production room had been covered in dust and pieces of the roof, which also prevented a good overview of the room.",
                "As the judge could not inspect the incident scene, in order to gather evidence he talked to the director, R.U. He had to wait thirty minutes for the director to be found and to finish his telephone call with the Belgrade mayor, N.Č. The director stated that the explosion had occurred when the factory ’ s experts with a team of additional experts (part of the statement is illegible ) had apparently tested a new product - manufacturing process with which he was not familiar. However, he clarified that the manufacturing process required special security measures and teams, and named all of the factory ’ s experts involved, including the applicant ’ s son as a chief engineer. The technical director, S.K., stated that his team of between seventeen and twenty employees had been testing a new product and that experts from other companies and faculties “might have been involved” in the manufacturing process that afternoon. Presuming that ten people had died, he anticipated that the cause of the explosion may have been “an unwanted, unexpected and unknown chemical reaction which had ‘ broken out ’ during the process”.",

He reported that nine corpses had been found and gave the names of several injured people who had been transported to hospital (one of them had died there) as well as a short statement by one of the workers who had been nearby. The inspector reported that the police firemen had already started extinguishing the fire, that the crime-scene technicians, M.P. and M.Š, had taken photographs, and that the criminal police ( Kriminalistička služba (UZSK) ) had taken on the case.

He clarified further that he had not used most of the Institute ’ s documentation, as it concerned computer -generated and simulated experiments of assumed events which could only indirectly hint at the possible answers. The expert stated that the collected data were incomplete and did not contain quantitative figures of the samples examined to allow any deeper analysis of the collected evidence or its compliance with the account of the events that had allegedly led to the explosion. While not excluding the possibility that the cause of the explosion might have been the one suggested by the police experts, the expert observed that the possible exposure of AP to humidity could have made it sensitive to an organic compound and the explosion could have been caused by a piece of paper, wood or engine oil, especially in the presence of unwanted metal or soot particles."

Firstly, whereas in the Šilih case the short lapse of time (one year) between the death of the applicant ’ s son and the acceptance by Slovenia of the right of individual petition was a crucial element, the fatal accident that had triggered the investigation in the present case took place nine years before the ratification date. Furthermore, and contrary to the Court ’ s position in numerous post- Šilih cases in which a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision were, or should have been, carried out after ratification, the public investigation at issue was carried out and terminated before the critical date. The Government stressed that although the criminal prosecution pursued by the applicant had continued beyond the ratification date, the applicant had not requested the reopening of the investigation. The competent authorities could not have initiated another ex officio investigation or resumed the prosecution after the initial investigation had been terminated and the applicant had already taken over the prosecution in the capacity of a “ subsidiary prosecutor ”. The Government therefore opined that the applicant ’ s complaint should be rejected by the Court as incompatible with the Convention ratione temporis."

                "(a) The State ’ s procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding a State regardless of whether the death, as a triggering event, took place before or after the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that State (see Šilih, cited above, §§ 159 and 162, and Velcea and Mazăre v. Romania, no. 64301/01, § 81, 1 December 2009 ).",
                "(b) However, bearing in mind the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended.",
                "(i) Firstly, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. The reference to “procedural acts” must be understood in the sense inherent in the procedural obligation under Article 2, namely, acts undertaken in the framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible or to an award of compensation to the injured party. The word “omissions” refers to a situation where there has been no investigation or where only insignificant procedural steps have been carried out, but where it is alleged that an effective investigation ought to have taken place (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, §§ 142-44, ECHR 2013 ).",
                "(ii) Furthermore, there must be a “genuine connection” between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. That means, in practice, that in order for a “genuine connection” to be established, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State must have been reasonably short (in principle, not exceeding ten years) and most of the investigative steps required by this provision must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the Convention ’ s entry into force (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, § 206, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Janowiec, cited above, §§ 146-48).",

While the death and the preliminary investigative measures indeed took place before 3 March 2004, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia is not excessively long. Various procedural acts were undertaken in the framework of the impugned criminal proceedings over a period of over twelve years after the critical date, notably a criminal trial.

As already noted above, Serbia ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004 and the official investigation into the incident had ended by 2003. In view of the absence of a pending investigation after the ratification date, the alleged events could not be of a continuing nature. According to the Government, the six-month time-limit had started to run as soon as the right to individual application to the Court had become available in Serbia.

When the trial commenced, he could reasonably expect that a more effective investigation and a more logical analysis would eventually be carried out by the judicial authorities, in view of the controversial death of his son and the prior investigative conclusions, which had been highly questionable. However, the applicant decided not to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings, but rather to lodge an application with the Court after this complex case restarted before the new chamber in 2007. He did so as he had begun to suspect that the trial was being obstructed and with the intention of accelerating it."

The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is, inter alia, to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6638/03, 2 4 August 2004). That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State ’ s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court ’ s own examination of the case. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Mocanu, cited above, § 262, with further references )."

Russia (dec.), no. 1721/07, 31 May 2011; see also Eren v. Turkey (dec.), no. 42428/98, 4 July 2002 ). In principle, the Court has qualified its previous case-law in cases of unlawful or violent death by requiring the applicant to bring such a case to the Court within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a few years after the events in question (see Varnava and Others, § 162 ). Stricter expectations would apply in cases where there was a complete absence of any investigation or progress in an investigation, or meaningful contact with the authorities. Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, or where a criminal prosecution is being pursued, even by the relatives themselves, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait longer for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues ( ibid ., §166 ). It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention."

Applying those principles to the facts of the present case, the Court notes firstly that on 12 June 2000, after preliminary investigative measures had been undertaken, the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute anyone on the grounds that no elements of any offence had been established which would be prosecuted ex officio. The Court accepts that in certain cases the six - month period may start running on the date when the applicants are informed that the national authorities are unable or unwilling to institute criminal proceedings in relation to their complaints (see Aydın v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 28293/95, 29494/95 and 30219 /96, ECHR 2000 ‑ III (extracts)). However, shortly after receiving such information, the applicant notified the competent criminal court that he intended to take over the prosecution by lodging a request for further investigative steps to be undertaken. On 8 April 2003, the applicant was informed that following his request the investigation had been terminated and that the public prosecutor was not interested in resuming the prosecution of the matter; however, he was informed that he could file an indictment if he so wished. Indeed, on 22 April 2003 the applicant continued to pursue a subsidiary prosecution by filing a bill of indictment against certain individuals. Where a national system allows the possibility for the victim ’ s family to take over the prosecution of the case on their own behalf, such post-ratification proceedings must also be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month time-limit (see paragraph 99 above)."

Despite the fact that certain documents from the preliminary investigation were not available to the applicant, the beginning of the criminal trial in May 2004, which is a potentially adequate remedy, must have raised his expectations of yet obtaining redress (see Mladenović, cited above) and he acted reasonably in awaiting developments in the criminal proceedings."

Although there were adjournments and lulls in the judicial activity in this case, there were no periods of total inactivity allowing the Court to establish the date on which the applicant was or could have been aware that the remedies had become ineffective, given that he had consistently displayed the requisite interest in obtaining a concrete result and had continued his efforts by pursuing a subsidiary prosecution (see, by contrast, Gasyak and Others v. Turkey, no. 27872/03, § 58, 13 October 2009, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009). The Court therefore accepts that the applicant, as he himself argued, must have started to doubt that the criminal prosecution was not progressing in February 2007 when the trial again recommenced before a new chamber. This relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant could or should already have been aware, more than six months before he lodged the application on 3 August 2007, that the criminal proceedings which were under way would not elucidate the situation, also having in mind that the court heard some of the crucial figures in this case and, moreover, rendered a first-instance judgment after February 2007."

In addition to the said finding of a violation, it ordered the competent courts to bring the impugned criminal proceedings to a conclusion as soon as possible and declared that the applicant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 6 7 above ).

Secondly, the Court may, in principle, accept a lower award of compensation by the domestic authorities than it would award itself, judged in the light of the standard of living in the State concerned.

The positive obligation to take all appropriate steps to safeguard life for the purposes of Article 2 (see paragraph 71 above) entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54; İlhan v.

                "91. Where lives have been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State, that provision entails a duty for the State to ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response – judicial or otherwise – so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54).",

In this connection, the Court has held that if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation to set up an ‘ effective judicial system ’ does not necessarily require criminal proceedings to be brought in every case and may be satisfied if civil, administrative or even disciplinary remedies were available to the victims (see, for example, Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, § 90, ECHR 2004-VIII; Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 51; and Mastromatteo, cited above, §§ 90 and 94-95).",

However, in areas such as that in issue in the instant case, the applicable principles are rather to be found in those the Court has already had occasion to develop in relation notably to the use of lethal force, principles which lend themselves to application in other categories of cases.",
                "In this connection, it should be pointed out that in cases of homicide the interpretation of Article 2 as entailing an obligation to conduct an official investigation is justified not only because any allegations of such an offence normally give rise to criminal liability (see Caraher v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24520/94, ECHR 2000-I), but also because often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death are, or may be, largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 47 ‑ 49, §§ 157-64, and İlhan, cited above, § 91).",
                "In the Court ’ s view, such considerations are indisputably valid in the context of dangerous activities, when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, which are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused such incidents.",
                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",

Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum (see Binişan v.

It also places a duty on the State and/or local government authorities, as appropriate, to set up supervision mechanisms.

However, given that the Government did not contend that the matter could have been effectively pursued outside the framework of criminal proceedings, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the measures taken in the framework of the proceedings instituted by the applicant within the Serbian criminal-law system, and within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction, were satisfactory in practice (see, in this respect, Öneryıldız and Henriques Pereira, both cited above). As mentioned above, the assessment of whether the domestic authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention when confronted with an arguable case of negligence causing deprivation of lives extends to the criminal trial (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 95, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above)."

The commission consisted of officers of the Security Institute and the two co-owners of the company JPL Systems, who, while sitting in private, published the report eight months later (see paragraphs 19-20; see also paragraphs 30, 36 and 64 above for the other experts ’ comments on the report ).

An expert report was provided in May 1998 (see paragraph 30 above). The witnesses and those assigned by the applicant as suspects were heard between November 1998 and October 1999. The State Intelligence Service executives were heard in 1999-2000 and their statements were thereafter classified as State secret by the investigating judge (see paragraph 32 above). On 12 June 2000 the prosecutor decided not to further investigate or to prosecute (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has not received the prosecutor ’ s decision, if it was made in writing.",

The competent judicial authorities refused to open an investigation, having established that the rocket fuel had been produced at the request of the State Intelligence Service and the then Serbian President (see paragraphs 36-38 above). After the Supreme Court ’ s referral of the case back for further investigation and the District Court ’ s warning of the procedural defects in handling the case (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above), the investigating judge opened the investigation for another year to hear the five suspects and provide another report on the cause of the accident.

Given that the criminal trial is still under way, the issue to be assessed is not whether the judicial authorities, as the guardians of the laws laid down to protect lives, were determined to sanction those responsible, if appropriate (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 112 and 11 5), but whether the judicial authorities proceed with exemplary diligence and promptness. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an alleged infringements of the right to life may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Hugh Jordan, cited above, §§ 108 and 136-140; McCaughey, cited above, § 130; and Hemsworth, cited above, § 69)."

During that time, one of the accused has died (see paragraph 61 above). Only nine hearings were held while a total of twenty-one hearings were cancelled or adjourned by the competent courts for various procedural reasons. The Court observes that there were several long periods of unexplained inactivity and, moreover, that the trial recommenced before new chambers on six occasions either because of changes on the bench or because such delays in proceedings call for a fresh trial (see paragraphs 54, 56-57 and 59-61 above).

The present case was a matter of considerable political and pressing public sensitivity in which, the Court concedes, there may have been obstructiveness deployed by various sides in order to prevent progress in an investigation. However, the sensitive nature of the case and the obstacles are less an excuse for delay than a further reason for the State to have organised its judicial system to overcome the earlier defects and omissions by the prompt and diligent establishment of the facts at the criminal trial and to have brought those responsible to justice, if any, in order to avoid or disprove any appearance of a cover-up (see McKerr, cited above, and Dimitrov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 77938/11, § 148, 1 July 2014 ). In addition, even if a prosecution is brought and suspects stand trial, the Court will examine whether this is a “meaningful” or serious exercise with any realistic prospects of bringing the perpetrator to account (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, §§ 231, 250 and 251, ECHR 2005 ‑ II (extracts). Violations have also been found where the trial had continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending) or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see, mutatis mutandis, Teren Aksakal v.

In that regard, the Court would stress that the passage of time inevitably erodes the amount and quality of evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence casts doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts (see Trubnikov v. Russia, no. 49790/99, § 92, 5 July 2005 ). Moreover, the very passage of time is liable to compromise definitely the chances of investigation being completed (see M.B. v.

The Court considers that in Article 2 cases concerning proceedings instituted to elucidate the circumstances of an individual ’ s death, lengthy proceedings such as those are a strong indication that the proceedings were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State ’ s procedural obligations under the Convention, unless the State has provided highly convincing and plausible reasons to justify such a course of proceedings (see Šilih, cited above, § 203). Indeed, in the present case, the Government have failed to show any reason justifying such lengthy proceedings following the ratification date (compare to Mladenović, Blečić above, § 54, where the post-ratification eight-year long proceedings had been mostly concerned with the assessment of evidence, as argued by the Government, and remained unclear as to why there was still no final acquittal or conviction in the case)."

Switzerland, 26 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997 ‑ IV ). Later, in Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland ( [GC], no. 27644/95, §§ 4 6 ‑ 55, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ), the Court fully confirmed that position. Much like the applicants in those two cases, in his application to the Supreme Administrative Court the applicant in the instant case did not point to concrete health hazards, but complained about the reclamation scheme's hypothetical consequences for the environment and human health (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above).

Sweden, 25 November 1993, §§ 2 4 and 25, Series A no. 279 ‑ B ). However, that conclusion was clearly influenced by the fact that the dump was indisputably polluting the water in the applicants'well, which was their only source of drinking water. The adverse effects on their health were thus, unlike the situation in the present case, immediate and certain. Similarly, in Taşkın and Others the Court found that the applicants'right to protection of their physical integrity was directly at stake in the proceedings before the Turkish Supreme Administrative Court, because the scale of the risk had been established by that court (see Taşkın and Others, cited above, § 133, as well as Öçkan and Others, cited above, § 52 ). In Okyay and Others, the Court made similar findings, and regarded the fact that the domestic courts had ruled in the applicants'favour on the merits as decisive (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey, no. 36220/97, §§ 65 ‑ 6 8, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII ).

There is no question that if the applicant had brought such compensation proceedings Article 6 § 1 would have applied to them (see, among other authorities, Editions Périscope v.

However, that does not mean that it is applicable, on that ground alone, to earlier proceedings whose outcome is capable of supplying the cause of action for such compensation proceedings.

The board comprised experts from the Ministry of Industry, of Environment and Water, and from the Ministry of Finance, as well as from Panagyurski Mini EAD and ET Marin Blagiev. It held a meeting on 7 September 1999 to discuss the relative merits of the two schemes. It noted that both lacked checks on the stability of the pond. However, according to an expert's report, neither of them would impair the pond's stability. Both lacked climatological and hydrological descriptions of the area and data on the expected consolidation of the sludge after the reclamation had ended. The problems relating to the neutralisation of the acid water were partially addressed in ET Marin Blagiev's scheme and not addressed in Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme. According to an expert's report, it was possible to use stabilised waste-water sludge from the Plovdiv treatment plant. The area around the pond did not have enough humus for the biological reclamation envisaged by Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme; it would thus be necessary to enrich the existing soil artificially. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme envisaged finishing the reclamation in eighteen months and resolving the dust-spread problem even before that. Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme also had an eighteen ‑ month timeline, but it was unrealistic. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme provided for the restoration of the productive qualities of 19.2 ha of polluted soil outside the tailings pond and its use for the production of specialised grass. According to accounts submitted by the two firms, ET Marin Blagiev's scheme would cost 5,139,356 Bulgarian levs (BGN) and Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme BGN 5,878,945. On that basis, the board recommended that the Ministry of Industry's Interdepartmental Expert Council approve ET Marin Blagiev's scheme. Two experts representing Panagyurski Mini EAD disagreed, saying that this scheme did not meet various regulatory requirements. In particular, waste ‑ water sludge was not appropriate for reclamation; humus was much better suited for that task. It was also unclear whether the use of sludge would yield stable and safe results. According to the relevant classifier, the sludge from the Plovdiv plant was hazardous waste, because it came not only from domestic but also from industrial waste water. The documents relating to the scheme did not specify the exact toxic-substance content of the sludge. Lastly, the scheme's scope and potential effects on the environment warranted an EIA. The updated initial scheme suffered from none of these drawbacks, but, on the contrary, would provide a sustainable solution."

After finding out about the above licence, on 21 December 2000 the applicant applied to the Supreme Administrative Court ( Върховен административен съд ) for judicial review of the Minister's decision to grant it. He started by contending that he had a sufficient legal interest to contest the decision, because it impacted on his right under Article 55 of the Constitution (see paragraph 47 in limine below) to live in a “ healthy and favourable environment corresponding to the established standards and norms ”. He pointed out that he lived in Elshitsa, close to the place where the licence allowed sludge to be laid, and that the sludge could have adverse effects on the environment and human health. He also referred to Article 120 § 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 47 in fine below). He further argued that the decision was null and void, as its implementation was impossible. The decision allowed ET Marin Blagiev to carry and process domestic waste-water sludge. However, this could not be done, because the waste water treated in the Plovdiv plant came from both domestic and industrial sources. It was unfeasible to separate the domestic from the industrial sludge and for this reason it was impossible to carry and process solely domestic sludge. The applicant further argued that the Minister's decision unlawfully classified the sludge as industrial waste, as under the relevant rules it was hazardous waste; this was also evident from various analyses. Furthermore, the Minister had taken the decision in breach of the rules of procedure, as no EIA had been drawn up."

It said that there was a risk of heavy-metal contamination impacting on the population's health within a ten ‑ kilometre perimeter around the pond. The reclamation scheme lacked a suitable system for monitoring the underground water, where the migration of such metals could be expected, as the polymer cover was not stable in the long term. According to an expert in the Centre's toxicology laboratory, the heavy-metal content of the sludge spread on the pond was above the regulatory maximum, as shown by the chemical analysis of samples. The high levels of copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, cobalt and chrome led to a pollution risk and a risk to the population's health. So did the presence in the sludge of lead and manganese. Those metals could have a negative impact on the nerve, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the kidneys, the liver and the production of blood. Some of them were allergens, mutagens and carcinogens. The scheme's implementation would thus lead to a risk of dust from the sludge spreading in the atmosphere. There was also a risk that those metals would migrate through the surface and underground water, because of the acid pH of the water in the pond.

It gave an account of, among other things, the heavy ‑ metal content of water coming out of the pond and of grass near it. These measurements were based on two water samples and five grass samples. One of the water samples did not show a heavy ‑ metal content above the regulatory maximum levels, whereas the other did, leading the report to conclude that the pond's drainage water was heavily polluted. According to the report, the polluting content of the grass samples was below the regulatory maximum level, but the applicant submitted that its authors had used the wrong comparators, using the regulatory maximum levels for soil, not grass, which were considerably lower. The report said that the pond should continue to be monitored, but at a decreasing pace, with sample ‑ taking once a year for grass and twice a year for water. Further reporting was envisaged in 2010."

Firstly, Eco Elshitsa EOOD's report was actually indicative of pollution, as it had found that the heavy-metal content of the water flowing out of the pond was higher than the regulatory maximum. The report was in parts misleading because it used erroneous comparators, and covered only the time between November 2006 and November 2007. No information was available in respect of the preceding period and it was not envisaged to provide such information in the future. Moreover, the report did not contain any estimate of the scheme's effects on the health of the local population. In any event, it could not be seen as a reliable source of information as it had been drawn up by the very company which should have been monitored. The applicant secondly relied on the official reports mentioned in paragraph 46 above, which stated that the sludge from the Plovdiv plant contained heavy metals and constituted hazardous waste. Furthermore, an expert opinion obtained by the mayor of Elshitsa in 2004 had shown that the scheme had increased the pond's toxicity instead of providing a sustainable solution to the problem through its reclamation."

However, such harm was very likely, especially in the long term, in view of the air, plant and water pollution coming from the sludge and the consequent introduction of harmful substances in the food chain. In his view, the existence of such risk, which weighed heavily on his private and family life and the enjoyment of the amenities of his home, was sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8."

Second, since the laying of sludge in fact amounted to a waste ‑ disposal operation, it had been necessary to carry out an EIA under the law, both as it stood at the time of the implementation of the scheme and as amended after the 2002 changes. The discontinuance of the EIA procedure had therefore been unwarranted. Moreover, even if an EIA was not mandatory, it should have been carried out to dispel or confirm the local population's well ‑ founded fears. However, the authorities had chosen to ignore their continued protests, had not completed the EIA and had not made funding available for an assessment of the scheme's effect on the population's health."

When reaching their decision, they had not taken into account the opinion of the local authorities and had not notified those likely to be affected. Later they had ignored the applicant's requests to stay the scheme's implementation, and had not imposed on the contractor any obligations to minimise the impact of its activities on the environment."

However, no such assessment had been carried out before the scheme's implementation and the one commissioned after that had remained unfinished. In the applicant's view, in approving that scheme and in granting ET Marin Blagiev a waste ‑ disposal licence, the authorities had acted in breach of domestic law. As a result of that, and of the authorities'passive attitude, there was no reliable information on the scheme's effects on the environment and the health of those living near the pond. Although the scheme's effects were not as tangible as noise or smell, they were nonetheless extremely harmful to the environment and to human health, as evidenced by the expert opinions of the National Centre for Hygiene, Medical Ecology and Nutrition. The toxic substances contained in the sludge, which exceeded many times the maximum regulatory levels and which migrated through the underground water, the atmosphere and the nutrition chain, had a direct effect on the applicant's home and his private and family life and attained the minimum level of severity required to bring Article 8 into play. It was also significant that the impugned situation had lasted more than ten years. It could not therefore be regarded as trivial or negligible. It was sufficiently serious to prompt the authorities to assess the pollution and find ways to tackle it. However, they had not taken effective steps in that regard, and had not followed appropriate procedures allowing the applicant's views to be heard."

Based on medical reports and expert opinions showing that hydrogen sulphide emissions from the plant exceeded the permitted limit and could endanger the health of those living nearby, and that there could be a causal link between those emissions and health problems suffered by the applicant's daughter, and the acceptance of the domestic courts that, without being a grave health risk, the nuisances in issue impaired the quality of life of those living in the plant's vicinity, the Court was satisfied that Article 8 was engaged (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § § 7, 49 and 50, Series A no. 303 ‑ C ).

The Court noted that the crucial element which must be present in determining whether, in a given case, environmental pollution has adversely affected one of the rights safeguarded by that provision was the existence of a harmful effect on a person's private or family sphere and not simply the general deterioration of the environment (see Kyrtatos, cited above, § § 52 and 53 )."

It held that to raise an issue under Article 8, environmental pollution must directly affect the applicant's home, family or private life and that its adverse effects must attain a certain minimum level. It went on to say that the assessment of that minimum was relative and depended on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or mental effects. The general context of the environment should also be taken into account, there being no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in a modern city (see Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 68 ‑ 70, with further references ). In finding Article 8 applicable, the Court took into consideration that the concentration of polluting substances in the air near the applicant's home had continuously exceeded the applicable norms, that the State had recognised that the environmental situation had caused an increase in the morbidity rate for the local residents, that the domestic courts had recognised the applicant's right to be resettled away from the “sanitary security zone” in which she lived, and that there was a “very strong combination of indirect evidence and presumptions ” which made it possible to conclude that the applicant's prolonged exposure to emissions from the plant had caused her health to deteriorate or had at least made her more vulnerable to various illnesses and had adversely affected her quality of life at home (ibid., §§ 80 ‑ 88).

In that connection, the Court would add that, in assessing evidence, it has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact, and it has been the Court's practice to allow flexibility in that respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 79). The salient question is whether the applicant has been able to show to the Court's satisfaction that there has been an actual interference with his private sphere, and, secondly, that a minimum level of severity has been attained (see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 70). The mere allegation that the reclamation scheme did not comply with domestic rules – such as the 1992 Regulations on hygienic requirements for the protection of health in the urban environment (see paragraph 51 above) – is not sufficient to ground the assertion that the applicant's rights under Article 8 have been interfered with (see, mutatis mutandis, Furlepa v. Poland (dec.), no. 62101/00, 18 March 2008, and Galev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 18324/04, 29 September 2009 )."

                "76. In the instant case, the Court, while not in doubt that the laying of sludge from the Plovdiv waste ‑ water treatment plant on the tailings pond created an unpleasant situation in the surroundings, is not persuaded that the resulting pollution affected the applicant's private sphere to the extent necessary to trigger the application of Article 8, for several reasons. First, unlike the situation in the majority of the above ‑ mentioned cases, the applicant's home and land are situated at a considerable distance from the pollution's source : his house is about one kilometre from the tailings pond and the land which he cultivates is about four kilometres away (see paragraph 7 above). Secondly – and this point is closely related to the first – the pollution emanating from the pond is not the result of active production processes which can lead to the sudden release of large amounts of toxic gases or substances (contrast López Ostra; Guerra and Others; and Fadeyeva, cited above). This also means that there is less risk of a sudden deterioration of the situation (contrast Tătar, cited above). Thirdly, there is no indication that there have been incidents entailing negative consequences for the health of those living in Elshitsa (contrast Guerra and Others and Tătar, both cited above). Admittedly, various domestic authorities found that the sludge laid on the pond, coming as it does partly from industrial waste water, contains substances – chiefly heavy metals – which are not suited for reclamation purposes and are capable of adversely affecting human health when spreading in the environment (see paragraphs 10, 11, 32, 34, 45 and 46 above). However, there are no materials in the case file to show that the pollution in and around the pond has caused an increase in the morbidity rate of Elshitsa's residents (contrast Fadeyeva, cited above) or has had a sufficiently adverse impact on the applicant's enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life. Indeed, the applicant conceded that he could not show any actual harm to his health or even a short ‑ term health risk, but merely feared negative consequences in the long term (see paragraph 62 above and contrast López Ostra and Fadeyeva, both cited above ). Nor did the applicant provide particulars showing that the degree of disturbance in and around his home had been such as to considerably affect the quality of his private or family life (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 118 )."

It is true that in declaring the applicant's application for judicial review admissible the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court found that the applicant, as well as all persons living near the pond, had a sufficient interest in bringing proceedings in relation to that situation (see paragraph 25 above). However, unlike the Turkish court in Taşkın and Others (cited above, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14), it did not base that ruling on findings about the extent to which the applicant had been personally affected by the impugned reclamation scheme. It rather had regard to the general aim of the domestic environmental protection legislation, which are quite different from the aims of Article 8 of the Convention. It should be pointed out in this connection that the conditions governing individual applications under the Convention are not necessarily the same as the national criteria relating to locus standi in domestic proceedings. National rules on that point may serve different purposes and, while those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be. Indeed, the underlying object of the Convention mechanism is to provide a safeguard to those personally affected by violations of fundamental human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ). As already noted, neither Article 8 nor any of other provision of the Convention or its Protocols were specifically designed to provide protection of the environment; other international instruments and domestic legislation are better suited to address such issues (see Kyrtatos, cited above, § 5 2 in fine )."

However, he has not apparently suffered any actual harm to date.

In that case, the Court found that Article 6 § 1 did not apply to proceedings in which the applicants had challenged the extension of a nuclear power station's licence, because they had not “ establish [ed] a direct link between the operating conditions of the power station which were contested by them and their right to protection of their physical integrity, as they [had] failed to show that the operation of [the] power station exposed them personally to a danger that was not only serious but also specific and, above all, imminent ” (see Balmer ‑ Schafroth and Others v. Switzerland, 26 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997 ‑ IV ). Later, in Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland ( [GC], no. 27644/95, §§ 4 6 ‑ 55, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ), the Court fully confirmed that position. Much like the applicants in those two cases, in his application to the Supreme Administrative Court the applicant in the instant case did not point to concrete health hazards, but complained about the reclamation scheme's hypothetical consequences for the environment and human health (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). It must therefore be concluded that the connection between the proceedings – whose sole object was the lawfulness of the decision to grant a licence allowing ET Marin Blagiev to carry and lay sludge – and the right invoked by the applicant was too tenuous."

            [
                "93. It is true that in an earlier case, Zander, where the applicants had sought to challenge a licence allowing a company to lay waste in a dump adjacent to their property, the Court found Article 6 § 1 applicable, saying that the outcome of the proceedings was decisive for the applicants'entitlement to protection against pollution (see Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, §§ 2 4 and 25, Series A no. 279 ‑ B ). However, that conclusion was clearly influenced by the fact that the dump was indisputably polluting the water in the applicants'well, which was their only source of drinking water. The adverse effects on their health were thus, unlike the situation in the present case, immediate and certain. Similarly, in Taşkın and Others the Court found that the applicants'right to protection of their physical integrity was directly at stake in the proceedings before the Turkish Supreme Administrative Court, because the scale of the risk had been established by that court (see Taşkın and Others, cited above, § 133, as well as Öçkan and Others, cited above, § 52 ). In Okyay and Others, the Court made similar findings, and regarded the fact that the domestic courts had ruled in the applicants'favour on the merits as decisive (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey, no. 36220/97, §§ 65 ‑ 6 8, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII ). The position in the present case, in which the Supreme Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings and did not make any findings about the reclamation scheme's effect on the applicant's health or well ‑ being (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above), is different."

There is no question that if the applicant had brought such compensation proceedings Article 6 § 1 would have applied to them (see, among other authorities, Editions Périscope v. France, 26 March 1992, § § 37 and 40, Series A no. 234 ‑ B ). However, that does not mean that it is applicable, on that ground alone, to earlier proceedings whose outcome is capable of supplying the cause of action for such compensation proceedings. Proceedings do not become “civil” merely because they have economic implications, and the application for judicial review lodged by the applicant pursued the sole aim of having the licence annulled (see, mutatis mutandis, SARL du Parc d'activités de Blotzheim and SCI Haselaecker v.

The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA) whereas, if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

These guideline values are set at the level of the lowest adverse health effect, meaning any temporary or long-term deterioration in physical, psychological or social functioning that is associated with noise exposure, and represent the sound pressure level which affects the most exposed receiver in a given environment."

These values are based on annoyance studies but most European countries have adopted a 40 dB LAeq as the maximum allowable for new developments."

The applicant opted for the later. The Court notes that in the administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant she was able to seek the relevant expert measurements to be carried out and that the administrative bodies were empowered to issue decisions ordering the reduction of the noise level. In the Court's view the administrative remedy was hence able to address a situation of the violation alleged by the applicant.

A home will usually be a place, a physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person's home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person's right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003-VIII )."

The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA) whereas, if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

These guideline values are set at the level of the lowest adverse health effect, meaning any temporary or long-term deterioration in physical, psychological or social functioning that is associated with noise exposure, and represent the sound pressure level which affects the most exposed receiver in a given environment."

In relation to noise levels in homes, the guidelines state that to protect the majority of people from being seriously annoyed during the daytime, the sound pressure level on balconies, terraces and in outdoor living areas should not exceed 55 dB LAeq for steady continuous noise and should not exceed 50 dB LAeq to protect people from being moderately annoyed. These values are based on annoyance studies but most European countries have adopted a 40 dB LAeq as the maximum allowable for new developments."

This value has been obtained by assuming that the noise reduction from outside to inside with the window partly open is 15 dB and, where noise is continuous, the equivalent sound pressure level should not exceed 30 dB indoors, if negative effects on sleep, such as a reduction in the proportion of REM sleep, are to be avoided.",

Ireland (dec.), no. 33267/96, 15 June 1999). In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, the use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Moreira Barbosa v.

The applicant opted for the later. The Court notes that in the administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant she was able to seek the relevant expert measurements to be carried out and that the administrative bodies were empowered to issue decisions ordering the reduction of the noise level. In the Court's view the administrative remedy was hence able to address a situation of the violation alleged by the applicant.

A home will usually be a place, a physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person's home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person's right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003-VIII )."

Similarly to the situation in Moreno Gómez, and contrary to the above- mentioned cases where the Court found that the noise had not been excessive, in the present case the measuring of the level of noise in the period covering some eight years indicated that night-time noise had been excessive. The first measurement carried out on 1 May 2001 showed even then that the level of noise had been beyond the set standards. Further measurements, carried out on 13 October and 17 November 2001, 20 September 2002, 14 February 2003 and 19 December 2008 also established that the level of noise in the applicant's flat had been beyond the set standards.

Thus, it ordered the company L., the owner of the bar F., to reduce the level of noise from their equipment for reproduction of music. However, this decision was not complied with. In the ensuing proceedings there were significant delays. In this connection the Court stresses that regulations to protect guaranteed rights serve little purpose if they are not duly enforced. The Court notes that although the measurements carried out on 13 October and 17 November 2001 both showed an excessive noise level, the administrative authorities took no action until 15 February 2002, when they ordered the owner of the bar to add sound insulation to the walls and inter-floor construction according to the Croatian standards in that respect.

It was only on 23 February 2009 that the level of noise coming from the bar F. was found to be within acceptable limits.

They all resulted in the finding that the cooperative ’ s activities did not cause a nuisance and did not exceed the permissible level of noise established for the applicants ’ neighbouring area (see paragraphs 21, 23, 29, 36, 39 and 51 above).

The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, § 108, 21 February 2002 ). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162 - 165 above that the flooding of 7 August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities ’ manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities ’ failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk ( see paragraphs 168 - 180 and 185 above)."

The Court has no doubt that the causal link established between the negligence attributable to the State and the endangering of the lives of those living in the vicinity of the Pionerskoye reservoir also applies to the damage caused to the applicants ’ homes and property by the flood. Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to “interference” but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants ’ rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 136). Since it is clear that no such measures were taken, the Court concludes that the Russian authorities failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicants ’ homes and property."

According to the decision, the preliminary investigation had established that because of exceptionally heavy rains on 7 August 2001 the water level in the Pionerskoye reservoir had been close to critical, with the result that there was a real risk of a dam breaking, which could have claimed numerous lives and caused extensive pecuniary damage, and that in ordering the evacuation of water from the reservoir Mr L. had acted within his competence and in full compliance with the relevant regulations and had thus prevented more extensive damage to the residents of Vladivostok. At the same time, according to an expert report of 24 January 2003 ( see paragraphs 72 - 80 below), the main reason for the flood of 7 August 2001 had been the poor state of the channel of the Pionerskaya river, and in particular the fact that it had been overgrown with trees and bushes and obstructed by various structures.

However, the resulting document had not been duly registered with the competent State authority and had thus remained ineffective and could not be taken into account in elaborating town planning restrictions.

The letter further stated that the work done by the city authorities to clear the river channel had not helped to prevent the houses and other structures from being flooded because the evacuation of water by the Water Company had been sudden and massive, with the result that even special concrete waterfronts of the dam outlet channel had been broken. The letter went on to say that the reservoir was the property of the regional authorities and therefore the Vladivostok city authorities had no power to reprimand staff of the Water Company. However, criminal proceedings had been brought in connection with the pecuniary damage suffered by residents of Vladivostok and the disruption of transport lines during the heavy rains and the evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir which should lead to the punishment of those responsible. Also, the Administration of the Sovetskiy District had filed a civil claim requesting that the actions of the Water Company be found unlawful.

If the Pionerskoye reservoir had not existed, on the date in question the rain flooding to the mouth of the Pionerskaya river would have reached a maximum volume of 440 cubic metres per second. The Government also contended that prior to the heavy rain on 7 August 2001 the Pionerskoye reservoir had had sufficient water storage capacity to hold the rainwater if the amount that fell had corresponded to the amount forecast, and therefore before 7 August 2001 there had been no need to evacuate water in smaller quantities over a longer period in an attempt to avoid the flood.

Indeed, it is clear from the adduced materials that in the years preceding the flood, the authorities knew that it might be necessary urgently to release water from the reservoir. In particular, in his letter of 7 June 1999 the head of the Water Company informed the Vladivostok Administration that it might be necessary to evacuate water urgently from the reservoir in the event of heavy rain ( see paragraph 15 above ); and in a letter of 29 May 2000 the Vladivostok Administration admitted that the water level in the reservoir was close to critical and some of it would have to be evacuated ( see paragraph 19 above ). Against this background, even if it is prepared to accept that the rain on 7 August 2001 was of an exceptional intensity, the Court is not persuaded that the authorities could claim to have been taken unaware by the rain in so far as the operation of the Pionerskoye reservoir was concerned.

The Court is aware that it cannot be excluded that construction has gone on in the area downstream of the reservoir ever since the facility went into operation in 1936. The Court is also mindful of the fact that it has no temporal jurisdiction to assess this situation as it may have existed prior to 5 May 1998, the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia."

In particular, the report reveals that the presence of bridges and service pipelines in some parts of the river had raised the water level by up to 1.5 metres ( see paragraph 77 above ).

In particular, in a letter of 7 June 1999 addressed to the Vladivostok city authorities, the head of the Water Company stated that in view of the adverse weather forecast for the summer / autumn 1999, and in particular in the event of heavy rain, the Water Company might have to evacuate water from the reservoir, which might cause flooding over an extensive area given the poor state of the river channel (see paragraph 15 above)."

In particular, the said decision stated that the question of cleaning up the course of the Pionerskaya river was regularly raised every year, and yet no measures had been taken. The decision attested to the poor condition of the river channel, confirming, in particular, that the river channel as well as its outlet channels were abundantly overgrown with vegetation, cluttered with debris and household waste, and blocked by unauthorised dams and other structures which created a threat of flooding over an area of 15 square kilometres, with a population of over 5,000 people, in the event of the urgent large-scale release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision urged the authorities at the municipal and district levels to take the necessary measures, including cleaning and deepening the river channel to ensure that its throughput capacity was no less than 30-40 cubic metres per second. It was also prescribed that the local population be duly informed that the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river might be inundated in the event of the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision also ordered the restoration of the local early warning system to raise the alarm if there was a threat of flooding (see paragraph 16 above)."

Indeed, a letter from the Vladivostok Administration dated 29 May 2000 made it clear that the river channel remained overgrown with vegetation and cluttered with debris, that the risk of flooding persisted and that urgent steps should be taken in that connection ( see paragraph 19 above). A report by the Vladivostok Administration drawn-up on 4 July 2001, that is shortly before the events under examination, reflected in detail the poor state of the river channel and recommended a number of measures, similar to those already prescribed on several occasions (see paragraph 22 above)."

In any event, informing the public of the inherent risks was one of the essential practical measures needed to ensure effective protection of the citizens concerned (cf. Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 152). In this connection, the Court notes that in a letter of 16 June 2000 the Administration of the Sovetskiy District of Vladivostok stated that the population living in the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river had been told what to do in the event of serious inundation ( see paragraph 20 above). However, the Court is sceptical about that statement, given that the letter provided no further details, for example, as to the form in which the information concerned had been provided to the population, or what the contents of that information were. At the same time, the Court notes that the applicants consistently maintained that, even though by 7 August 2001, when the flood occurred, they had been living near the Pionerskoye reservoir for many years, they had never been warned by the authorities that they lived in a flood -prone area ( see paragraphs 47 - 49 above)."

Moreover, the Government failed to indicate the relevant legislative and administrative framework, merely referring to various legal acts and instruments ( see paragraph 167 above).

Secondly, there was no coherent supervisory system to encourage those responsible to take steps to ensure adequate protection of the population living in the area, and in particular to keep the Pionerskaya river channel clear enough to cope with urgent releases of water from the reservoir, to set in place an emergency warning system there, and to inform the local population of the potential risks linked to the operation of the reservoir. Lastly, it has not been established that there was sufficient coordination and cooperation between the various administrative authorities to ensure that the risks brought to their attention did not become so serious as to endanger human lives.

The Court reiterates at the outset that whilst at times there may be a significant overlap between the concept of “home” under Article 8 of the Convention and that of “property” under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, a home may be found to exist even where the applicant has no right or interest in real property (see, mutatis mutandis, Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, §§ 35-39, 18 November 2004, and Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, § 128, 15 November 2007 ). Conversely, an individual may have a property right in a particular building or land, within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, without having sufficient ties with it for it to constitute a home under Article 8 (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI). In the present case, the applicants ’ complaints concerned damage done by the flood to their homes – of which the first, fourth and fifth applicants were owners and the second and sixth applicants were social tenants, and which the third applicant shared with the fourth applicant, her relative (see paragraphs 10 - 14 above) – and to their possessions in and around those homes. The Court considers it appropriate to examine the applicants ’ relevant complaints under both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "208. The Court further observes that the applicants received certain extra-judicial compensation in respect of pecuniary losses they sustained as a result of the flood of 7 August 2001. In particular, the first applicant received a lump sum of RUB 14,000 ( approximately EUR 350 ) and the remaining applicants each received RUB 1,000 (approximately EUR 25) in financial support. The question therefore arises whether, for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention, the applicants can still claim to be “victims” of the alleged violation of their rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § § 178-93, ECHR 2006 ‑ V )."

                "209. In the present case, there is no evidence that the authorities at any point acknowledged the violations alleged by the applicants. Indeed, it is clear from the Government ’ s submissions on the issue that the compensation in question was accorded to all the victims of the flood of 7 August 2001 as financial aid and not in acknowledgment of the authorities ’ responsibility for the events in question. Moreover, no such acknowledgement was made in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the events of 7 August 2001, or in the civil proceedings which the applicants brought seeking compensation for their pecuniary losses. Also, even if the Court were prepared to regard the compensation in the amount of RUB 14,000 paid to the first applicant as an appropriate and sufficient redress, it clearly could not reach the same conclusion as regards the compensation in the amount of RUB 1,000 paid to the remaining applicants."

Italy ( dec .), no. 36811/97, 4 May 2000, and Öneryıldız, cited above, § 134 ). Allegations of a failure on the part of the State to take positive action in order to protect private property should be examined in the light of the general rule in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which lays down the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Beyeler v.

Nor did they dispute the existence of the applicants ’ “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, or that the above homes and possessions were damaged as a result of the flood of 7 August 2001. The Court will therefore proceed to examine to what extent the authorities were under obligation to take measures to protect the applicants ’ homes and possessions, and whether this obligation was complied with in the present case."

The Court further notes that the Government seem to have argued, with reference to the findings of the domestic courts in the applicants ’ civil cases, that the alleged infringements of their rights under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were the result of a natural disaster, in the form of exceptionally heavy rain, which could not have been foreseen, and could therefore not be imputed to the State. The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, § 108, 21 February 2002 ). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162 - 165 above that the flooding of 7 August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities ’ manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities ’ failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk ( see paragraphs 168 - 180 and 185 above)."
            ],

The Court has no doubt that the causal link established between the negligence attributable to the State and the endangering of the lives of those living in the vicinity of the Pionerskoye reservoir also applies to the damage caused to the applicants ’ homes and property by the flood. Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to “interference” but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants ’ rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 136). Since it is clear that no such measures were taken, the Court concludes that the Russian authorities failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicants ’ homes and property."

Accordingly, as it related to animal and environmental protection, it was undeniably in the public interest (compare Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz, ibid. ). It follows that only weighty reasons can justify the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression in this context. The Court further observes that the domestic courts adjudicating the applicant’s case carefully examined whether the issue of the requested civil injunction would violate the applicant association’s right to freedom of expression. In doing so, the domestic courts applied the standards developed by the Court as set out above. They expressly accepted that the impugned representations constituted expressions of opinion and where thus protected under the right to freedom of expression. They further acknowledged that this right protected expressions even if they were formulated in a polemic or offensive way (compare paragraph 10, above) and that the impugned posters related to questions of public interest, as they were obviously intended to criticise the conditions under which animals were kept (compare paragraph 11, above)."

The intended campaign, which had been carried out in a similar way in the United States of America, consisted of a number of posters, each of which bore a photograph of concentration camp inmates along with a picture of animals kept in mass stocks, accompanied by a short text. One of the posters showed a photograph of emaciated, naked concentration camp inmates alongside a photograph of starving cattle under the heading “walking skeletons”. Other posters showed a photograph of piled up human dead bodies alongside a photograph of a pile of slaughtered pigs under the heading “final humiliation” and of rows of inmates lying on stock beds alongside rows of chicken in laying batteries under the heading “if animals are concerned, everybody becomes a Nazi”. Another poster depicting a starving, naked male inmate alongside a starving cattle bore the title “The Holocaust on your plate” and the text “Between 1938 and 1945, 12 million human beings were killed in the Holocaust. As many animals are killed every hour in Europe for the purpose of human consumption”."

The plaintiffs were at the time the president and the two vice-presidents of the Central Jewish Council in Germany. All of them had survived the Holocaust when they were children; C.K. lost her family through the Holocaust.

This right protected expressions of opinion even if they were formulated in a polemic or offensive way. The depictions were particularly disturbing and drew a high degree of media attention because the pictures combined on the posters showed seemingly similar situations, which could only be discerned by the fact that one side showed coloured photographs of animals and the other black-and-white photos of humans, both alive and dead. Seen from the point of view of an ordinary spectator, the impugned posters had to be interpreted as putting the fate of the depicted animals and of the depicted humans on the same level."

It followed that the expression of opinion related to questions of public interest and would thus generally enjoy a higher degree of protection when weighing the competing interests. However, in the instant case it had to be taken into account that concentration camp inmates and Holocaust victims had been put on the same level as animals. In the light of the image of man conveyed by the Basic Law, which put human dignity in its centre and only marginally referred to the protection of animals, this comparison appeared arbitrary because the Holocaust victims were confronted with their suffering and their fate of persecution in the interest of animal protection. The debasement of concentration camp inmates was thus exploited in order to militate for better accommodation of laying hens and other animals."

However, this did not necessarily imply that the use of these pictures also amounted to a violation of the represented persons’ human dignity. Having regard to the specific circumstances of the instant case, the court considered that the intended campaign did not deny the depicted Holocaust victims their personal value by putting them on a par with animals.

It was, furthermore, acceptable to conclude that this content of the campaign affected the plaintiffs’ personality rights. Referring to its earlier case law, the Federal Constitutional Court considered that it was part of the self-image of the Jews living in Germany that they belonged to a group which had been sampled out by their fate and that a special moral obligation was owed to them by all others, which formed part of their dignity."

When weighing the competing interests, the plaintiffs’ legal position could be granted preference over the applicant association’s right to freedom of expression even without relying on a violation of the plaintiffs’ human dignity. The lower courts had put forward sufficient reasons to allow this conclusion. In particular, the courts had begun to weigh the competing interests. Furthermore, they had based their assumption that the impugned campaign violated the plaintiffs’ human dignity on the fact that they considered the violation of the plaintiff’s personal honour as particularly serious. As these considerations applied in a similar way to a violation of the plaintiffs’ personality rights, it had to be assumed that these principles would also guide the courts in case of a remittal."

Furthermore, it had to be considered that the sanction imposed on the applicant association had not been very severe and that the applicant association had numerous other possibilities to express their protest against mass animal farming.",

Korn in his capacity as a Jew living in Germany and the Jews living in Germany, who were, by a majority, represented by the Central Council of Jews in Germany. They emphasised that it was accepted in the established case-law of the Federal Court of Justice and of the Federal Constitutional Court that the Jews living in Germany regarded themselves as a group singled out by fate, towards whom all others had a particular moral responsibility. Consequently, a denial or trivialisation of the genocide of Jews in the Third Reich violated the right of each member of this group. The direct violation of the rights of all Jews living in Germany was also recognised in simple legal standards and on a European level."

The Court notes that it is common ground between the parties that the impugned measure constituted an “interference by [a] public authority” with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under Article 10 of the Convention. The Court endorses this assessment. Such interference contravenes the Convention if it does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10. It therefore falls to be determined whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, had an aim or aims that is or are legitimate under Article 10 § 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the aforesaid aim or aims."

The Court observes that the applicant association did not contest that these provisions, under the established domestic case-law, grant any person whose personality rights risk being violated by another person a claim to compel that other person to refrain from performing the impugned action. There is no doubt that the relevant texts were accessible to the applicant association. As to the question of whether the domestic courts correctly applied these provisions, the Court reiterates that the application and the interpretation of the domestic law primarily fall within the competency of the domestic authorities which are, in the nature of things, particularly well placed to settle the issues arising in this connection (compare inter alia Barthold v. Germany, 25 March 1985, § 48, Series A no. 90). The Court observes that the applicant association’s argument primarily evince its disagreement with the domestic courts’ decisions. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that the injunction complained of was “prescribed by law”."

                "“68. The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, § 39, ECHR 2003-V, and Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 56, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

The Court’s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 45, ECHR 1999-I). This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the comments held against the applicants and the context in which they made them (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, § 52, ECHR 2000-I).",

France, no. 64915/01, § 70, ECHR 2004-VI). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Zana v. Turkey, judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, pp. 2547-48, § 51).”"

In assessing the proportionality of the measure at issue they have, beyond the complete prohibition or authorisation of the expression of an opinion, in particular the option of setting specific limits to the authorisation or to the prohibition. Moreover, freedom of expression is applicable to not only “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 78, 7 February 2012, with further references). Furthermore, there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on matters of public interest (see, among other authorities, Ceylan v.

Accordingly, as it related to animal and environmental protection, it was undeniably in the public interest (compare Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz, ibid. ). It follows that only weighty reasons can justify the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression in this context. The Court further observes that the domestic courts adjudicating the applicant’s case carefully examined whether the issue of the requested civil injunction would violate the applicant association’s right to freedom of expression. In doing so, the domestic courts applied the standards developed by the Court as set out above. They expressly accepted that the impugned representations constituted expressions of opinion and where thus protected under the right to freedom of expression. They further acknowledged that this right protected expressions even if they were formulated in a polemic or offensive way (compare paragraph 10, above) and that the impugned posters related to questions of public interest, as they were obviously intended to criticise the conditions under which animals were kept (compare paragraph 11, above)."

The Court further observes that the domestic courts considered that the intended poster campaign did not pursue the aim to debase the depicted concentration camp inmates, as the pictures merely implied that the suffering inflicted upon the depicted humans and animals was equal. The domestic courts considered, however, that the applicant association confronted the plaintiffs with their suffering and their fate of persecution in the interest of animal protection. It was this “instrumentalisation” of the plaintiffs’ suffering that violated their personality rights in their capacity as Jews living in Germany and as survivors of the Holocaust. This violation was aggravated by the fact that the depicted Holocaust victims were shown in a most vulnerable state. Having regard to the seriousness of this violation, the courts considered that the applicant association’s interests in publishing the impugned pictures had to cede. While expressing its doubts as to whether the intended campaign violated the human dignity of either the depicted persons or the plaintiffs, the Federal Constitutional Court endorsed the lower courts’ assessment that the campaign banalised the fate of the Holocaust victims and that the violation of the plaintiffs’ personal honour was particularly serious."

It observes that a reference to the Holocaust must also be seen in the specific context of the German past (see Hoffer and Annen, ibid. ) and respects the Government’s stance that they deem themselves under a special obligation towards the Jews living in Germany (compare paragraph 36, above). In the light of this, the Court considers that the domestic courts gave relevant and sufficient reasons for granting the civil injunction against the publication of the posters. This is not called into question by the fact that courts in other jurisdictions might address similar issues in a different way (also compare Müller v.

The Court of Appeal further observed that the film “Poisoning for profit”, through its accompanying commentary and through the way specific scenes were cut together, conveyed the core message that the C. company systematically contravened the law. Similar principles applied to two further short versions already broadcast. The Court of Appeal concluded that the C. company ’ s request was to be granted insofar as it concerned this specific footage. However, the defendant was, in principle, not prevented from using the footage in other ways, as long as he did not convey any misleading message.",

In reaching this conclusion, the Hamm Court of Appeal relied on a number of statements which had been made on the applicant association ’ s website (see paragraphs 15-16, above). Based on these statements, the Court of Appeal considered, for instance, that the applicant associations had approved of a personal attack against one of the C. company ’ s business associates.

The applicants in the present case disputed the aim of the interference with their property rights by arguing that there were no forests on the land which had been given to them, or that those forests were not of national importance (see paragraph 121 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as such errors may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I, and Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, § 32, 4 March 2003).

Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, § 89, ECHR 2007 ‑ I). It therefore considers that in the present case it was primarily the role of the domestic courts to establish whether the applicants ’ land included forests and whether those forests were of national importance, in accordance with domestic law. The Court cannot overlook the fact that in some of the applicants ’ cases different public registers provided inconsistent information about whether their land was forested (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 67 above), or that the various authorities in charge of the protection of forests had not objected to the restoration of that land to the applicants (see paragraphs 16, 43 and 65 above). However, the domestic courts held that the presence of forests on the applicants ’ land had been sufficiently established by the information provided by the State Forest Management Service (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 67 above). The courts also found that those forests were urban forests because the areas in which they were situated had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996, and that they had been officially designated as forests of national importance in 2000 (see paragraphs 19, 26, 46 and 67 above).

The prosecutor submitted that, according to the data provided by the State Forest Management Service ( Valstybinė miškotvarkos tarnyba ), 0.25 hectares of the plot was covered by forest. Since that forest was situated in a city (see paragraph 10 above), it was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). The prosecutor noted that the forest had been included in the plan of forests of national importance adopted by the Government in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above), that is before the VCA had adopted its decision to give that land to I.B.

Accordingly, when the VCA had adopted the decision to give that plot to I.B. (see paragraph 13 above), the forest situated on it had already been recognised as a forest of national importance.

It reiterated that the Constitution and several laws prohibited the transfer of forests of national importance from the State into private ownership on any basis whatsoever, including restoration of property rights (see paragraphs 86 and 88 ‑ 91 below). Accordingly, it was immaterial that, as submitted by the VCA, its decision complied with certain regulations adopted during the restitution process. The Court of Appeal considered that the first-instance court had correctly found that the forest on the plot given to I.B. was urban forest and therefore a forest of national importance, and thus property rights in respect of that part had to be annulled. However, it stated that when determining the area covered by forest the information had to be taken not from the Real Estate Register but from the Register of Forests ( Miškų kadastras ), which was administered by the State Forest Management Service. According to the latter, the plot given to I.B. included 0.25 hectares of forest.

It also noted that that forest was included in the list of forests of national importance created in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above). The court observed that even though restoration of property rights was a continuous process and included the preparation of various documents, the final decision to restore property rights had to comply with the law in force at the time of the adoption of that decision. It concluded that the VCA ’ s decision to give the plot to I.B.

It considered that that court had been correct in finding that the forest in question was a forest of national importance and that the VCA ’ s decision had thus been contrary to mandatory statutory provisions prohibiting the transfer of such forests into the ownership of private individuals. In response to the applicant ’ s argument that she had lost the opportunity to have her property rights restored (see paragraph 47 above), the Vilnius Regional Court stated that Lithuanian law provided for partial restitution, and that where it was impossible to restore property rights in natura, it could be done in other ways, including by monetary compensation (see paragraphs 92 and 97 below).

It accepted the applicant ’ s argument that she might face financial difficulties as a result of having to return money to J.S. because she no longer had the necessary amount.

In its ruling of 12 April 2012 in a civil case no. 3K-7-165/2012, the Supreme Court stated that there was divergent practice among domestic courts with regard to the effects of the annulment of administrative acts on restoration of property rights, in particular when the persons to whom those rights had been restored had later sold that property to third parties. The Supreme Court observed that, in some cases, the courts annulled all subsequent transfers of the property, ordered each party to return to the other what it had received from the transaction, and stated that the process of restoration of property rights with respect to the initial claimant would have to be started afresh. In other cases, courts considered that the process of restoration in respect of the initial claimant had to be considered completed, and that the State had to reclaim the property from the final purchaser, for adequate compensation. An extended panel of the Supreme Court therefore considered it necessary to harmonise the courts ’ practice. It held:",
                "“In the present case, the State lost its ownership of a forest of national importance as a result of administrative acts on restoration of property rights adopted by its authorised institution, the VCA. These decisions have been declared unlawful and have been annulled ... After the annulment of the administrative acts on restoration of property rights, the State should regain its property rights in respect of the plots of land which were unlawfully transferred to [the claimants], and restoration of the property rights of the latter would have to be decided anew. However, in this case, the plots of land have been transferred to third parties for monetary consideration ...",

In this case, one of the circumstances determining the need for restitution is the fact that, in line with Article 47 of the Constitution, forests of national importance belong exclusively to the State, so they must be returned to it. Other specific features of restitution in this case are determined by the nature of the process of restoration of property rights ...",
                "In this case there was no dispute as to [the claimants ’ ] right to restoration of their property rights, but it was found that the property in question could not be returned to them in natura. It has not been determined that [the claimants] exercised any undue influence on the authorities ’ decisions. Accordingly, the transfer of forests of national importance into [the claimants ’ ] ownership occurred because of the authorities ’ actions, whereas [the claimants] trusted the competence of the authorities. The extended judges ’ panel observes that, contrary to the conclusions of the lower courts in this case, [the claimants ’ ] good faith in the process of restoration of property rights has not been denied. Simply because they, as careful and diligent parties to a legal relationship, ought to have known that the law prohibited the restoration of property rights to forests in urban areas, does not constitute grounds to regard them as having acquired the property in bad faith, since they did not have the competence to make any decisions on the limits of the plots of land to be given to them and, as stated before, there are no grounds to find that they exercised any undue influence on the authorities ’ decisions ... In such circumstances, where persons acting in good faith have [acquired] forests of national importance as a result of the improper actions of the authorities, restitution after the annulment of the relevant administrative acts must be applied in a way as not to deny those persons ’ rights to legal certainty and the protection of their legitimate expectations ...",

In cases such as the present, where restitution has to be applied primarily because of the unlawfulness of authorities ’ decisions, the State must assume the negative effects of restitution, while [the individuals concerned] can only be made to suffer minimal negative effects of returning the property to the State, as provided for by law.",

In view of that, as well as all of the above considerations, the extended judges ’ panel holds that restitution shall not be applied to [the claimants] – they shall not be ordered to return the money received from the sale agreement to the other party, and the restoration process in their respect shall be considered complete; otherwise their situation would be unfairly and disproportionately worsened (Article 6.145 § 2 of the Civil Code) ...",

It is of the view that that interference has to be regarded as deprivation of property within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Paplauskienė v. Lithuania, no. 31102/06, §§ 37-38, 14 October 2014, and Romankevič v. Lithuania, no. 25747/07, § 33, 2 December 2014).",

The Court observes that the requirement that forests of national importance can only belong to the State is established in the Constitution (see paragraph 86 above) and the Law on Forests (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above). The Law on Forests also provides that forests situated in cities constitute forests of national importance (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above), and the Law on Restitution similarly provides that urban forests are redeemable by the State (see paragraphs 90 and 91 above). The relevant provisions of that legislation were in force at the time when the applicants ’ property rights were restored (see paragraphs 13, 41 and 62 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the decisions adopted by the VCA to restore the applicants ’ property rights to plots of land including urban forests did not comply with the aforementioned legislation, and the annulment of those decisions was therefore in accordance with the law. It is also satisfied that the requirement for the applicants, after their property rights had been annulled, to return the relevant plots to the State was in accordance with the law (see Article 1.80 of the Civil Code in paragraph 94 above)."

The Court takes note of the particular situation of the fourth applicant, who had sold the plot containing forest to a third party before her rights to that plot were annulled (see paragraph 62 above). It appears from the Supreme Court ’ s ruling of 12 April 2012 (see paragraph 103 above) that, at the time when her property rights were annulled and she was ordered to return the money to the purchaser and return the plot to the State (see paragraphs 67, 68 and 70 - 73 above), the practice of the domestic courts was inconsistent. In some cases, the courts annulled all subsequent transfers of the property and ordered the parties to return to the other what they had received from the transaction (like in the fourth applicant ’ s case), whereas in other cases, the courts held that the State had to reclaim the property from the final purchaser. The Supreme Court decided to harmonise the case-law and adopt the latter position (see paragraph 103 above). The Court takes note of the Supreme Court ’ s decision; it also reiterates that divergence of case-law, in itself, cannot be considered contrary to the Convention (see Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, § 51, 20 October 2011).

It also observes that the Constitution of Lithuania and the case-law of the Constitutional Court establish the obligation of the State to take care of the natural environment, including forests, in the interests of society (see paragraphs 87 and 99 - 101 above). The courts which examined some of the applicants ’ cases also highlighted the importance of forests and the State ’ s obligation to protect them (see paragraphs 18 and 46 above)."

The applicants in the present case disputed the aim of the interference with their property rights by arguing that there were no forests on the land which had been given to them, or that those forests were not of national importance (see paragraph 121 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as such errors may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I, and Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, § 32, 4 March 2003). In other words, the Court cannot question the assessment of the domestic authorities unless there is clear evidence of arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, § 89, ECHR 2007 ‑ I). It therefore considers that in the present case it was primarily the role of the domestic courts to establish whether the applicants ’ land included forests and whether those forests were of national importance, in accordance with domestic law. The Court cannot overlook the fact that in some of the applicants ’ cases different public registers provided inconsistent information about whether their land was forested (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 67 above), or that the various authorities in charge of the protection of forests had not objected to the restoration of that land to the applicants (see paragraphs 16, 43 and 65 above). However, the domestic courts held that the presence of forests on the applicants ’ land had been sufficiently established by the information provided by the State Forest Management Service (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 67 above). The courts also found that those forests were urban forests because the areas in which they were situated had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996, and that they had been officially designated as forests of national importance in 2000 (see paragraphs 19, 26, 46 and 67 above). Having examined the domestic courts ’ reasoning, the Court cannot regard their findings as arbitrary and sees no reason to substitute them with its own assessment."

Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 120, ECHR 2000 ‑ I; Pyrantienė v. Lithuania, no. 45092/07, § 55, 12 November 2013; and Vukušić v. Croatia, no. 69735/11, § 64, 31 May 2016 )."

However, the need to correct an old “wrong” should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority ’ s action in good faith. In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations. The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned. In the context of revoking ownership of a property transferred erroneously, the good governance principle may not only impose on the authorities an obligation to act promptly in correcting their mistake, but may also necessitate the payment of adequate compensation or another type of appropriate reparation to its former bona fide holder (see Lelas v. Croatia, no. 55555/08, § 74, 20 May 2010; Maksymenko and Gerasymenko v. Ukraine, no. 49317/07, § 64, 16 May 2013; and Bogdel v. Lithuania, no. 41248/06, § 66, 26 November 2013 )."

The Court lastly reiterates that the compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. It has held that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference. At the same time, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 95, ECHR 2006 ‑ V; Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 64, 19 February 2009; and Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § § 110 and 112, 25 October 2012). The Court has accepted that the principle of partial restitution to rectify old wrongs conformed to the Convention, and that, consequently, the amount of compensation for long-extinguished property rights could be assessed in accordance with calculation methods established in relevant legislation rather than with the full market value of such property (see Kavaliauskas and Others v. Lithuania, no. 51752/10, § § 53-56, 14 March 2017, and the cases cited therein ). However, the Court has previously found that the requisite fair balance was not struck in cases where the disproportion between the market value of the property and the compensation awarded to the applicants was “extreme” or “too significant” (see Vistiņš and Perepjolkins, cited above, § 119; Noreikienė and Noreika v. Lithuania, no. 17285/08, § 39, 24 November 2015; and Tunaitis v. Lithuania, no. 42927/08, § 42, 24 November 2015).",

In the present case, all the applicants complained that the annulment of their property rights to the plots of land restored to them had been contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The Court has already accepted that the plots had been transferred to the applicants in contravention of domestic law (see paragraph 133 above). In line with the general principles established in its case-law (see the references provided in paragraphs 139 and 140 above), the Court therefore considers that the Lithuanian authorities were entitled to correct their mistakes and annul the restoration of the applicants ’ property rights in order to protect forests classified as being of national importance. Accordingly, it is of the view that the annulment in itself did not constitute a violation of the applicants ’ rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "144. At the same time, the Court underlines that the decisions to restore the applicants ’ property rights were adopted by the authorities, who alone were responsible for making sure that their decisions complied with all relevant legislation. The applicants were ordinary citizens who participated in the restitution process under the same conditions as everyone else; they were not in a privileged position and there are no grounds to find that they acted unlawfully when obtaining their property (see also Pyrantienė, cited above, § 59, and Albergas and Arlauskas v. Lithuania, no. 17978/05, § 68, 27 May 2014 ). The courts which examined the first, second and third applicants ’ cases did not find any indication of bad faith on the part of those applicants either (see paragraphs 18 - 20, 23, 26, 28, 46, 48 and 50 - 51 above). Although the Court of Appeal in the fourth applicant ’ s case held that she could not have been considered a bona fide acquirer of property (see paragraph 71 above), the Court finds this conclusion difficult to accept. It observes that the Court of Appeal did not refer to any actions of the fourth applicant which might have demonstrated her bad faith, nor did it provide any relevant arguments why it had reached that conclusion with regard to the fourth applicant in a situation in which the only unlawful actions had been carried out by the authorities. The Court is not convinced that the fourth applicant (or any other applicants) should have questioned the actions of the relevant authorities instead of expecting the latter to take all measures to avoid mistakes in application of the legislation – especially taking into account the complexity and technical nature of the legal acts governing the process of restoration of land titles (see Misiukonis and Others v. Lithuania, no. 49426/09, § 60, 15 November 2016; see also the position of the Supreme Court of Lithuania in paragraph 103 above ). Therefore, the Court concludes that all the applicants obtained their property in good faith, and thus should not have had to bear the burden of remedying the mistakes for which the authorities were solely responsible (see the references provided in paragraph 140 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that, contrary to the Government ’ s submissions (see paragraph 129 above), it is immaterial for the assessment of the burden borne by the applicants how long they had owned the property in question before it was taken from them, or how much other property had been restored to them and not annulled."

The Court is mindful that it is not its role to determine the best way for States to correct errors made by authorities in the process of restoring property rights (see Misiukonis and Others, cited above, § 63). However, it reiterates that the correction of those errors should not create disproportionate new wrongs (see the references provided in paragraph 140 above). In the present case, the Court agrees with the applicants that expecting them to undergo a lengthy additional process, without having regard to their particular situation and the reasons why they had lost the previously restored property, had been disproportionate (see also the Vilnius Regional Court ’ s decision in the fourth applicant ’ s case in paragraph 68 above )."

The applicants also argued that after their property rights had been annulled, they had lost the opportunity to receive new plots of the same quality because no such plots were available in the relevant areas any more (see paragraph 122 above). The Court observes that Lithuanian law provides several forms of restoration of property rights, including not only restitution in kind but also monetary compensation, compensation in securities and discharging liabilities to the State (see paragraph 92 above). It reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not guarantee the right to acquire property and it cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention; nor does Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 impose any restrictions on the Contracting States ’ freedom to determine the scope of property restitution and to choose the conditions under which they agree to restore property rights of former owners (see Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002-II; Jantner, cited above, § 34; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX).

Accordingly, there was no dispute that she had had such a right (see also the findings of the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal in paragraphs 68 and 72 above). Therefore, after the applicant ’ s property rights to 0.15 hectares of land were annulled by the final court decision of 29 March 2011 (see paragraph 73 above), the authorities were under an obligation to act promptly in order to restore her property rights in one of the forms provided for by law."

In this connection, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s position that the cooperation of applicants with the public authorities in the restitution process is of key importance when determining the proportionality of the interference with their property rights (see paragraph 130 above; see also Paukštis, §§ 85-86, and Valančienė, §§ 71-72, both cited above ). In the present case, not only did the applicant not cooperate with the authorities, but she explicitly refused to participate in the restitution process in accordance with domestic law. In the Court ’ s view, such explicit refusal distinguishes the fourth applicant ’ s situation from that of the third applicant (see paragraphs 157 and 158 above) and other cases in which the applicants had failed to express their intentions but the Court nonetheless considered that the authorities should have proceeded with restitution irrespective of the applicants ’ will ( see Nekvedavičius, § 62, and Valančienė, § 63, both cited above ). It observes that the applicant herself effectively suspended the restitution process and any delays which followed after that cannot be considered the responsibility of the authorities. In this connection, the Court also reiterates that within the scheme of the Convention it is intended to be subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 42, ECHR 2008; Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09 and 2 others, § 61, ECHR 2012; and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 40167/06, §§ 29-32, 12 December 2017 ).

It held a meeting on 7 September 1999 to discuss the relative merits of the two schemes. It noted that both lacked checks on the stability of the pond. However, according to an expert's report, neither of them would impair the pond's stability. Both lacked climatological and hydrological descriptions of the area and data on the expected consolidation of the sludge after the reclamation had ended. The problems relating to the neutralisation of the acid water were partially addressed in ET Marin Blagiev's scheme and not addressed in Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme. According to an expert's report, it was possible to use stabilised waste-water sludge from the Plovdiv treatment plant. The area around the pond did not have enough humus for the biological reclamation envisaged by Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme; it would thus be necessary to enrich the existing soil artificially. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme envisaged finishing the reclamation in eighteen months and resolving the dust-spread problem even before that. Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme also had an eighteen ‑ month timeline, but it was unrealistic. ET Marin Blagiev's scheme provided for the restoration of the productive qualities of 19.2 ha of polluted soil outside the tailings pond and its use for the production of specialised grass. According to accounts submitted by the two firms, ET Marin Blagiev's scheme would cost 5,139,356 Bulgarian levs (BGN) and Panagyurski Mini EAD's scheme BGN 5,878,945. On that basis, the board recommended that the Ministry of Industry's Interdepartmental Expert Council approve ET Marin Blagiev's scheme. Two experts representing Panagyurski Mini EAD disagreed, saying that this scheme did not meet various regulatory requirements. In particular, waste ‑ water sludge was not appropriate for reclamation; humus was much better suited for that task. It was also unclear whether the use of sludge would yield stable and safe results. According to the relevant classifier, the sludge from the Plovdiv plant was hazardous waste, because it came not only from domestic but also from industrial waste water. The documents relating to the scheme did not specify the exact toxic-substance content of the sludge. Lastly, the scheme's scope and potential effects on the environment warranted an EIA. The updated initial scheme suffered from none of these drawbacks, but, on the contrary, would provide a sustainable solution."

He started by contending that he had a sufficient legal interest to contest the decision, because it impacted on his right under Article 55 of the Constitution (see paragraph 47 in limine below) to live in a “ healthy and favourable environment corresponding to the established standards and norms ”. He pointed out that he lived in Elshitsa, close to the place where the licence allowed sludge to be laid, and that the sludge could have adverse effects on the environment and human health.

The decision allowed ET Marin Blagiev to carry and process domestic waste-water sludge. However, this could not be done, because the waste water treated in the Plovdiv plant came from both domestic and industrial sources. It was unfeasible to separate the domestic from the industrial sludge and for this reason it was impossible to carry and process solely domestic sludge. The applicant further argued that the Minister's decision unlawfully classified the sludge as industrial waste, as under the relevant rules it was hazardous waste; this was also evident from various analyses. Furthermore, the Minister had taken the decision in breach of the rules of procedure, as no EIA had been drawn up."

It said that there was a risk of heavy-metal contamination impacting on the population's health within a ten ‑ kilometre perimeter around the pond. The reclamation scheme lacked a suitable system for monitoring the underground water, where the migration of such metals could be expected, as the polymer cover was not stable in the long term. According to an expert in the Centre's toxicology laboratory, the heavy-metal content of the sludge spread on the pond was above the regulatory maximum, as shown by the chemical analysis of samples. The high levels of copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, cobalt and chrome led to a pollution risk and a risk to the population's health. So did the presence in the sludge of lead and manganese. Those metals could have a negative impact on the nerve, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the kidneys, the liver and the production of blood. Some of them were allergens, mutagens and carcinogens. The scheme's implementation would thus lead to a risk of dust from the sludge spreading in the atmosphere. There was also a risk that those metals would migrate through the surface and underground water, because of the acid pH of the water in the pond. The methodology for reclaiming old polluted areas classified the area situated ten to twenty kilometres from the source of the pollution as being at risk."

Furthermore, an expert opinion obtained by the mayor of Elshitsa in 2004 had shown that the scheme had increased the pond's toxicity instead of providing a sustainable solution to the problem through its reclamation."

The applicant further pointed out that, as no studies had been carried out to assess the scheme's effects on the health of the local population, it was extremely hard to prove actual harm to his health. However, such harm was very likely, especially in the long term, in view of the air, plant and water pollution coming from the sludge and the consequent introduction of harmful substances in the food chain. In his view, the existence of such risk, which weighed heavily on his private and family life and the enjoyment of the amenities of his home, was sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8."

Second, since the laying of sludge in fact amounted to a waste ‑ disposal operation, it had been necessary to carry out an EIA under the law, both as it stood at the time of the implementation of the scheme and as amended after the 2002 changes. The discontinuance of the EIA procedure had therefore been unwarranted. Moreover, even if an EIA was not mandatory, it should have been carried out to dispel or confirm the local population's well ‑ founded fears. However, the authorities had chosen to ignore their continued protests, had not completed the EIA and had not made funding available for an assessment of the scheme's effect on the population's health."

When reaching their decision, they had not taken into account the opinion of the local authorities and had not notified those likely to be affected. Later they had ignored the applicant's requests to stay the scheme's implementation, and had not imposed on the contractor any obligations to minimise the impact of its activities on the environment."

In his further observations (see paragraph 6 above) the applicant submitted that under the applicable legislation and regulations, which he described in detail, reclamation schemes such as the one proposed and implemented by ET Marin Blagiev required a prior EIA. However, no such assessment had been carried out before the scheme's implementation and the one commissioned after that had remained unfinished. In the applicant's view, in approving that scheme and in granting ET Marin Blagiev a waste ‑ disposal licence, the authorities had acted in breach of domestic law. As a result of that, and of the authorities'passive attitude, there was no reliable information on the scheme's effects on the environment and the health of those living near the pond. Although the scheme's effects were not as tangible as noise or smell, they were nonetheless extremely harmful to the environment and to human health, as evidenced by the expert opinions of the National Centre for Hygiene, Medical Ecology and Nutrition. The toxic substances contained in the sludge, which exceeded many times the maximum regulatory levels and which migrated through the underground water, the atmosphere and the nutrition chain, had a direct effect on the applicant's home and his private and family life and attained the minimum level of severity required to bring Article 8 into play. It was also significant that the impugned situation had lasted more than ten years. It could not therefore be regarded as trivial or negligible. It was sufficiently serious to prompt the authorities to assess the pollution and find ways to tackle it. However, they had not taken effective steps in that regard, and had not followed appropriate procedures allowing the applicant's views to be heard."

Sweden (no. 1), 18 February 1991, § 48, Series A no. 192, recently cited in Hamer v. Belgium, no. 21861/03, § 79, ECHR 2007 ‑ XIII (extracts); Turgut and Others v. Turkey, no. 1411/03, § 90, 8 July 2008; and Rimer and Others v. Turkey, no. 18257/04, § 38, 10 March 2009 ). However, Article 8 is not engaged every time environmental deterioration occurs: no right to nature preservation is included as such among the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols (see Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI; Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96 in limine, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). Indeed, that has been noted twice by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, which urged the Committee of Ministers to consider the possibility of supplementing the Convention in that respect (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). The State's obligations under Article 8 come into play in that context only if there is a direct and immediate link between the impugned situation and the applicant's home or private or family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Botta v. Italy, 24 February 1998, § 34 in limine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I ).

The issue first came up in a case concerning a plant for the treatment of liquid and solid waste situated twelve metres from the applicant's home. Based on medical reports and expert opinions showing that hydrogen sulphide emissions from the plant exceeded the permitted limit and could endanger the health of those living nearby, and that there could be a causal link between those emissions and health problems suffered by the applicant's daughter, and the acceptance of the domestic courts that, without being a grave health risk, the nuisances in issue impaired the quality of life of those living in the plant's vicinity, the Court was satisfied that Article 8 was engaged (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § § 7, 49 and 50, Series A no. 303 ‑ C ). In that case the Court famously said that “ severe environmental pollution may affect individuals'well ‑ being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health ” (ibid., § 51 in limine )."

In a case concerning a factory producing fertilisers and caprolactam and situated about one kilometre from the town where the applicants lived, in finding that Article 8 was applicable the Court took into consideration that the factory had been classified as high ‑ risk under domestic law, that in the course of its production cycle it released large quantities of inflammable gas and other toxic substances, that an incident had occurred in which several tonnes of toxic gases had escaped, leading to the acute arsenic poisoning of one hundred and fifty persons, and that local experts had said that owing to the factory's geographical position, emissions from it into the atmosphere were often channelled towards the town where the applicants lived (see Guerra and Others v.

The Court noted that the crucial element which must be present in determining whether, in a given case, environmental pollution has adversely affected one of the rights safeguarded by that provision was the existence of a harmful effect on a person's private or family sphere and not simply the general deterioration of the environment (see Kyrtatos, cited above, § § 52 and 53 )."

To reach that conclusion, it had regard to the findings of the domestic courts, based on an environmental impact assessment, that the operation of the mine had caused widespread environmental degradation and had affected the applicants ( see Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14, ECHR 2004 ‑ X ). It reiterated those findings in a follow ‑ up case concerning the same mine (see Öçkan and Others v.

It held that to raise an issue under Article 8, environmental pollution must directly affect the applicant's home, family or private life and that its adverse effects must attain a certain minimum level. It went on to say that the assessment of that minimum was relative and depended on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or mental effects. The general context of the environment should also be taken into account, there being no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in a modern city (see Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 68 ‑ 70, with further references ). In finding Article 8 applicable, the Court took into consideration that the concentration of polluting substances in the air near the applicant's home had continuously exceeded the applicable norms, that the State had recognised that the environmental situation had caused an increase in the morbidity rate for the local residents, that the domestic courts had recognised the applicant's right to be resettled away from the “sanitary security zone” in which she lived, and that there was a “very strong combination of indirect evidence and presumptions ” which made it possible to conclude that the applicant's prolonged exposure to emissions from the plant had caused her health to deteriorate or had at least made her more vulnerable to various illnesses and had adversely affected her quality of life at home (ibid., §§ 80 ‑ 88). The Court made similar findings in a later case concerning the same iron smelter (see Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 53247/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, §§ 96 ‑ 100, 26 October 2006 )."

The above ‑ mentioned cases make it plain that the question whether pollution can be regarded as affecting adversely an applicant's Article 8 rights depends on the particular circumstances and on the available evidence. In that connection, the Court would add that, in assessing evidence, it has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact, and it has been the Court's practice to allow flexibility in that respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved ( see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 79). The salient question is whether the applicant has been able to show to the Court's satisfaction that there has been an actual interference with his private sphere, and, secondly, that a minimum level of severity has been attained (see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 70). The mere allegation that the reclamation scheme did not comply with domestic rules – such as the 1992 Regulations on hygienic requirements for the protection of health in the urban environment (see paragraph 51 above) – is not sufficient to ground the assertion that the applicant's rights under Article 8 have been interfered with (see, mutatis mutandis, Furlepa v.

In the instant case, the Court, while not in doubt that the laying of sludge from the Plovdiv waste ‑ water treatment plant on the tailings pond created an unpleasant situation in the surroundings, is not persuaded that the resulting pollution affected the applicant's private sphere to the extent necessary to trigger the application of Article 8, for several reasons. First, unlike the situation in the majority of the above ‑ mentioned cases, the applicant's home and land are situated at a considerable distance from the pollution's source : his house is about one kilometre from the tailings pond and the land which he cultivates is about four kilometres away (see paragraph 7 above). Secondly – and this point is closely related to the first – the pollution emanating from the pond is not the result of active production processes which can lead to the sudden release of large amounts of toxic gases or substances (contrast López Ostra; Guerra and Others; and Fadeyeva, cited above). This also means that there is less risk of a sudden deterioration of the situation (contrast Tătar, cited above). Thirdly, there is no indication that there have been incidents entailing negative consequences for the health of those living in Elshitsa (contrast Guerra and Others and Tătar, both cited above). Admittedly, various domestic authorities found that the sludge laid on the pond, coming as it does partly from industrial waste water, contains substances – chiefly heavy metals – which are not suited for reclamation purposes and are capable of adversely affecting human health when spreading in the environment (see paragraphs 10, 11, 32, 34, 45 and 46 above). However, there are no materials in the case file to show that the pollution in and around the pond has caused an increase in the morbidity rate of Elshitsa's residents (contrast Fadeyeva, cited above) or has had a sufficiently adverse impact on the applicant's enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life. Indeed, the applicant conceded that he could not show any actual harm to his health or even a short ‑ term health risk, but merely feared negative consequences in the long term (see paragraph 62 above and contrast López Ostra and Fadeyeva, both cited above ). Nor did the applicant provide particulars showing that the degree of disturbance in and around his home had been such as to considerably affect the quality of his private or family life (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 118 )."

However, unlike the Turkish court in Taşkın and Others (cited above, §§ 12 and 111 ‑ 14), it did not base that ruling on findings about the extent to which the applicant had been personally affected by the impugned reclamation scheme. It rather had regard to the general aim of the domestic environmental protection legislation, which are quite different from the aims of Article 8 of the Convention. It should be pointed out in this connection that the conditions governing individual applications under the Convention are not necessarily the same as the national criteria relating to locus standi in domestic proceedings. National rules on that point may serve different purposes and, while those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be. Indeed, the underlying object of the Convention mechanism is to provide a safeguard to those personally affected by violations of fundamental human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts) ).

The adverse effects on their health were thus, unlike the situation in the present case, immediate and certain. Similarly, in Taşkın and Others the Court found that the applicants'right to protection of their physical integrity was directly at stake in the proceedings before the Turkish Supreme Administrative Court, because the scale of the risk had been established by that court (see Taşkın and Others, cited above, § 133, as well as Öçkan and Others, cited above, § 52 ). In Okyay and Others, the Court made similar findings, and regarded the fact that the domestic courts had ruled in the applicants'favour on the merits as decisive (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey, no. 36220/97, §§ 65 ‑ 6 8, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII ). The position in the present case, in which the Supreme Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings and did not make any findings about the reclamation scheme's effect on the applicant's health or well ‑ being (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above), is different."

                "94. Lastly, the Court cannot subscribe to the applicant's argument that Article 6 § 1 applied to the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court because, if that court had decided to annul the licence, the applicant would have been able to apply, in separate proceedings, for compensation under section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 54 above). There is no question that if the applicant had brought such compensation proceedings Article 6 § 1 would have applied to them (see, among other authorities, Editions Périscope v. France, 26 March 1992, § § 37 and 40, Series A no. 234 ‑ B ). However, that does not mean that it is applicable, on that ground alone, to earlier proceedings whose outcome is capable of supplying the cause of action for such compensation proceedings. Proceedings do not become “civil” merely because they have economic implications, and the application for judicial review lodged by the applicant pursued the sole aim of having the licence annulled (see, mutatis mutandis, SARL du Parc d'activités de Blotzheim and SCI Haselaecker v. France (dec.), no. 48897/99, ECHR 2003 ‑ III )."

In sum, the Court finds that the outcome of the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court was decisive for the question whether the licence granted to ET Marin Blagiev was valid, but not for the “determination” of any “civil right” which Bulgarian law conferred on the applicant as a private individual."
