The Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention protects individuals in similar situations from being treated differently without justification in the enjoyment of their Convention rights and freedoms. This provision has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. However, the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions and to this extent it is autonomous. For Article 14 to become applicable, it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, mutatis mutandis, Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, p.17, § 36)."

The Committee notes that the above - established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs, functions or tasks. The Committee is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for under Article 1 (2) of the Convention. The Committee recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under Article 4, they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proved to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the State. Article 4 of the Convention does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community. The Committee also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice.",

According to the Government, the KGB Act constituted no more than a justified security screening measure intended to prevent former employees of a foreign secret service from working not only in State institutions but also in other spheres of activity which were important to the State ’ s national security. The KGB Act itself did not impose collective responsibility on all former KGB officers without exception. It provided for individualised restrictions on employment prospects by way of the list of positions in the former KGB which warranted application of the restrictions under section 2 of the KGB Act (see paragraph 27 above). The fact that the applicants were not entitled to benefit from any of the exceptions provided for in section 3 of the KGB Act showed that there existed a well - founded suspicion that the applicants lacked loyalty to the Lithuanian State.

In particular, the first applicant stressed that he had left the KGB in 1986 and the second applicant that he had left in 1990, thirteen and nine years respectively before the entry into force of the KGB Act. Furthermore, the first applicant contended that thereafter he had been actively involved in various activities promoting Lithuania ’ s independence. For his part, the second applicant submitted that he had been decorated as a prosecutor for his work in investigating various offences, including crimes against the State. However, none of those facts had been examined by the domestic courts, which had imposed restrictions on their future employment solely on the ground of their former employment in the KGB. Finally, the applicants submitted that as a result of the negative publicity caused by the enactment of the KGB Act and its application to them, they had suffered constant embarrassment on account of their past.",

The Court observes that, according to the Government, the fact of the applicants ’ KGB history cannot give rise to a complaint under Article 14 because not all former KGB officers were subjected to restrictions under the KGB Act. The Government stated that the reason for the enactment of the KGB Act and the employment restrictions imposed on the applicants was the lack of loyalty to the State on the part of former KGB officers. The Court observes that the KGB Act did not restrict the employment prospects of all former collaborators of the Soviet Security Service. Firstly, only those persons who had occupied the positions mentioned in the list of 26 January 1999 were considered to have the status of “former KGB officers” (see paragraph 27 above). Secondly, even those persons deemed to have that status could benefit from the amnesty rule mentioned in section 3 of the KGB Act if they had been engaged only in criminal, as opposed to political, investigations during their time at the KGB (see paragraph 24 above). Thirdly, there was the option of applying to the special presidential commission within a three - month period following the KGB Act ’ s entry into force on 1 January 1999, asking the commission, in the exercise of its discretion, to lift any restrictions which may have been applied (see paragraph 24 above). Finally, it also appears from the impugned domestic proceedings in the instant case that the domestic courts took into consideration whether the applicants had been informers for the Lithuanian authorities immediately after the declaration of independence in 1990 as a possible ground for relieving them of the employment restrictions imposed on them (see paragraph 22 above)."

In addition, in view of the Government ’ s argument that the purpose of the KGB Act was to regulate the employment prospects of persons on the basis of their loyalty or lack of loyalty to the State, there has also been a difference of treatment between the applicants and other persons in this respect. For the Court, this is the appropriate comparison in the instant case for the purposes of Article 14.",

This view is supported by the fact that ... it is not always possible to distinguish clearly which of an individual ’ s activities form part of his professional or business life and which do not. Thus, especially in the case of a person exercising a liberal profession, his work in that context may form part and parcel of his life to such a degree that it becomes impossible to know in what capacity he is acting at a given moment of time.”"

The Court ruled that the absence of the passport itself caused a number of everyday inconveniences taken in their entirety, as the applicant needed the passport when performing such mundane tasks as exchanging currency or buying train tickets. It was also noted in particular that the passport was required by that applicant for more crucial needs such as finding employment or receiving medical care.

Admittedly, the ban has not affected the applicants ’ ability to engage in certain types of professional activity. The ban has, however, affected their ability to develop relationships with the outside world to a very significant degree and has created serious difficulties for them in terms of earning their living, with obvious repercussions on the enjoyment of their private lives."

The Court also notes the applicants ’ argument that, as a result of the publicity caused by the adoption of the KGB Act and its application to them, they have suffered constant embarrassment as a result of their past activities. It accepts that the applicants continue to be burdened with the status of “former KGB officers” and that fact may in itself be considered an impediment to the establishment of contacts with the outside world – be they employment-related or other – and that this situation undoubtedly affects more than just their reputation; it also affects the enjoyment of their “private life”. The Court accepts that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one ’ s own actions such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence. Furthermore, during the considerable period which elapsed between the fall of the former Soviet Union (and the ensuing political changes in Lithuania ) and the entry into force of the impugned legislation in 1999, it can reasonably be supposed that the applicants could not have envisaged the consequences their former KGB employment would entail for them. In any event, in the instant case there is more at stake for the applicants than the defence of their good name. They are marked in the eyes of society on account of their past association with an oppressive regime. Hence, and in view of the wide-ranging scope of the employment restrictions the applicants have to endure, the Court considers that the possible impediment to their leading a normal personal life must be taken to be a relevant factor in determining whether the facts complained of fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention."

Lithuania wished to avoid a repetition of its previous experience by founding its State, inter alia, on the belief that it should be a democracy capable of defending itself. It is to be noted also in this context that systems similar to the one under the KGB Act, restricting the employment prospects of former security agents or active collaborators of the former regime, have been established in a number of Contracting States which have successfully emerged from totalitarian rule (see paragraphs 30-32 above)."

They argued that the impugned restrictions were imposed in the abstract and that they were punished solely on the basis of their status as former KGB officers without any account being taken of the special features of their own cases.

The Court reiterates that the requirement of an employee ’ s loyalty to the State is an inherent condition of employment with State authorities responsible for protecting and securing the general interest. However, there is not inevitably such a requirement for employment with private companies. Although the economic activities of private sector players undoubtedly affect and contribute to the functioning of the State, they are not depositaries of the sovereign power vested in the State. Moreover, private companies may legitimately engage in activities, notably financial and economic, which compete with the goals fixed for public authorities or State-run companies."

In particular, section 2 of the KGB Act lists very concisely the private sector activities from which the applicants, as persons deemed to be lacking in loyalty, should be excluded (see paragraphs 24 and 40 above). However, with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, the KGB Act contains no definition of the specific jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants are barred from holding. The result is that it is impossible to ascertain any reasonable link between the positions concerned and the legitimate aims sought by the ban on holding those positions. In the Court ’ s view, such a legislative scheme must be considered as lacking the necessary safeguards for avoiding discrimination and for guaranteeing adequate and appropriate judicial supervision of the imposition of such restrictions (see, inter alia, the conclusions pertaining to access to the public service reached in regard to similar legislation in Latvia by the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, referred to in paragraph 32 above)."

Due to the steady increase in Gypsy enrolment, by 1985/1986 their proportion had reached 17.5%, whereas only 2% of majority Hungarian students studied in special schools and classes. Eight grades finished in special education amounted to six grades in a normal school. Between 1972 and 1975, almost 50% of the lower grade special school students in Budapest were re - tested. The most significant result of the Budapest review was that if the borderline between sound and disabled mental abilities were set at IQ 70, the figure recommended by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ), then only 49.3% of students participating in special education qualified as mentally disabled, whereas 50.7% qualified as normal, of whom 12% had average intellect and 38.7% were borderline cases, that is, on the brink of mental retardation. However, only 7% were qualified as having average mental abilities through a complex evaluation. The complex evaluation qualified children whose test results suggested otherwise as intellectually disabled.

It reasoned that – while the statutory definition of “special needs” had been amended several times in the relevant period – the relevant regulations clearly stipulated that the expert panels should individualise each case, decide on possible special needs in each case according to the needs and circumstances of the individual child, identify the reasons underlying any special needs, and establish specific support services which a child needed according to the extent of disability."

However, it held that the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools and the subsequent placement of the applicants into remedial schools did not have any connection to their ethnic origin, and therefore found no discrimination against the applicants, concluding that their personality rights had not been violated. In its view, the applicants had not suffered any damage as a result of the unlawful conduct of the respondents, since, according to the court-appointed experts ’ opinion, they had been educated in accordance with their mental abilities.

This practice amounted to a violation of section 9 (indirect discrimination) of Act no. CXXV of 2003 on Equal Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities (“the ETA”).

The Advisory Committee stresses that placing children in such special schools should take place only when it is absolutely necessary on the basis of consistent, objective and comprehensive tests, which avoid the pitfalls of culturally biased testing. It considers it a positive step that the existence of and the need to address this unacceptable phenomenon has been recognised by the Ministry of Education. The Advisory Committee considers that the current situation is not compatible with Article 12(3) of the Framework Convention and must be remedied. ”"

[Of ] the three levels of disabilities into which children in special schools may fall (“very serious” (requiring residential care), “medium-severe” or “mild ” disability ), the vast majority of children assessed as having a “mild disability” could, in the view of many NGOs, be integrated relatively easily in the ordinary school system: many children are misdiagnosed due to a failure to take due account of cultural differences or of the impact of socio-economic disadvantage on the child ’ s development, and others suffer from only very minor learning disabilities that do not warrant the child ’ s removal from the mainstream system. ECRI repeatedly heard that investments in teacher training should primarily be directed towards ensuring that teachers in the mainstream school system are equipped to deal with diverse, integrated classes, rather than towards perpetuating a system from which children, once streamed into it, are unlikely to break out, and which overwhelmingly results in low levels of educational achievement and a high risk of unemployment. Some actors have suggested that – bearing in mind that the best way of ensuring that children do not wrongly become trapped in special schools is to ensure that they are never sent down that track in the first place – the category of children with mild disabilities should simply be deleted from the Education Act and all children with mild disabilities integrated in the mainstream school system.",

This notion had been formulated during the first big wave of re-diagnosis of Roma children transferred to special schools in the 1970s. According to contemporary research, familial disability could not amount to any type or form of mental disability, as it was in essence based on the social deprivation and the non-mainstream, minority cultural background of Roma families and children.

The “ review ” had been paper-based, their diagnoses had never been individualised, and their parents ’ rights had not been respected. These failures had been established by the domestic courts. Indeed, it had been a violation to assign them to special schools when their tests had indicated IQ scores higher than WTO standards for mental disability. For the applicants, the issue was why the Government had allowed expert panels across the country and in Nyíregyháza in particular to diagnose mild mental disability contrary to WHO standards. Given that the WHO standards had been applicable at the time, the development of science and the changing terminology could not serve as a reasonable justification for the misdiagnoses of the applicants and the deprivation of their right to access adequate education. Until 2007, special schools had not only educated mentally disabled children, but also educated children with special education needs, including educational challenge and poor socio-economic background. Due to an amendment in 2007, the PEA had prescribed that all children who had been sent to special schools because of “psychological disorders” or “learning difficulties” had to be re - tested in order to establish whether the disorder was the result of organic reasons; if not, those children had to be transferred back to normal schools."

They referred to NERC ’ s expert opinion of 28 June 2007, which stated that the culture-bias of the “Budapest Binet Test ” was less apparent in younger ages ( three to six years of age) because it measured primarily basic practical knowledge. When this test was applied, its cultural bias could be compensated by a pedagogical examination aimed at exploring practical knowledge. Moreover, this one had not been the only test applied; and the applicants had been tested with a complex method.

Therefore, in light of foreign experience gained in this field, it had been decided in the standardisation process not to lay down separate norms specifically applicable to Roma children but to use other means to ensure the fair assessment of all children in the course of the application of standardised tests. Relying on expert opinions, the Government claimed that socio-cultural background had been decisive for the mental development of the child, and when the actual level of a child ’ s mental development (IQ) had been measured, the result had necessarily been influenced by the same socio-cultural effects that had shaped the child ’ s mental development. In sum, the above results of the standardisation proved that IQ tests did not measure any difference between Roma and non-Roma culture or any cultural differences between Roma and non-Roma children. What they did measure was the effect of cultural deprivation or insufficient cultural stimuli in early childhood on the mental development of children, irrespective of their ethnic origin. Disproportionate representation of Roma children in special education was explained by their disproportionate representation in the group deprived of the beneficial effects of modernisation on the mental development of children.

In their submission, all that has to be established is that, without objective and reasonable justification, they were assigned to a school where, because of the limited curriculum, they were treated less favourably than non-Roma children in a comparable situation and that this amounted in their case to indirect discrimination (compare with the above-mentioned D.H. and Others judgment, § 183 )."

The Court notes that Roma children have been overrepresented among the pupils at the Göllesz Viktor Remedial Primary and Vocational School (see paragraph 7 above) and that Roma appear to have been overrepresented in the past in remedial schools due to the systematic misdiagnosis of mental disability (see paragraph 10 above). The underlying figures not having been disputed by the Government – who have not produced any alternative statistical evidence – the Court considers that these figures reveal a dominant trend. It must thus be observed that a general policy or measure exerted a disproportionately prejudicial effect on the Roma, a particularly vulnerable group. For the Court, this disproportionate effect is noticeable even if the policy or the testing in question may have similar effect on other socially disadvantaged groups as well. The Court cannot accept the applicants ’ argument that the different treatment as such resulted from a de facto situation that affected only the Roma. However, it is uncontested – and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise – that the different, and potentially disadvantageous, treatment applied much more often in the case of Roma than for others. The Government could not offer a reasonable justification of such disparity, except that they referred, in general terms, to the high occurrence of disadvantageous social background among the Roma ( see paragraph 96 above )."

Cyprus [GC], no. 29515/95, § 29, ECHR 1999-I; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 51, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI ).

The Court accepts that the Government ’ s position to retain the system of special schools/classes has been motivated by the desire to find a solution for children with special educational needs. However, it shares the disquiet of the other Council of Europe institutions who have expressed concerns about the more basic curriculum followed in these schools and, in particular, the segregation which the system causes (see paragraphs 73 to 75 above) – even if in the present case the applicants were not placed in ethnically segregated classes."

These children are unlikely to break out of this system of inferior education, resulting in their lower educational achievement and poorer prospects of employment.

Moreover, the social services administering the placement had been subject to constant reorganisation. In this regard, the court had found that the conditions necessary for the functioning of the Expert Panel had not been provided. Consequently, the Expert Panel and the County Council could not provide the necessary guarantees against misplacement which was historically more likely to affect Roma. Moreover, after a careful analysis of the applicable law, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court concluded that, as of 2003, children with special educational needs had included students with psychological developmental troubles (learning disabilities). It was not clear whether the applicants had mental (or learning ) disabilities that could not have been taken into consideration within the normal education system by providing additional opportunities to catch up with the normal curriculum.

Furthermore, as a result of the arrangements, the applicants were placed in schools for children with mental disabilities where a more basic curriculum was followed than in ordinary schools and where they were isolated from pupils from the wider population.

In that connection she complained that she had not been informed of the means used to identify the officers in question.

[the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. Such an investigation, as with one under Article 2, should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, regarding Article 2 of the Convention, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 161, Series A no. 324; Kaya v.

The Court reiterates that the assessment of the minimum level of severity is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV). In that connection the Court notes that the presence of injuries was recorded on the applicant’s person.

Those findings are consistent with the allegations made by the applicant to the police in her complaints of 21 and 23 July 2005.

When examining those requests, investigating judges nos. 9 and 11, who had jurisdiction to examine the criminal complaints lodged by the applicant, merely requested incident reports from the police headquarters and based themselves exclusively on the report by the headquarters when issuing a discharge order.

The domestic courts dismissed the applicant’s requests for an identity parade to be held behind a two-way mirror on account of the time that had elapsed since the altercations and the fact that it would be very difficult to recognise the officers because they had been wearing helmets at the time.

The Court acknowledges that in deciding claims related to non-pecuniary damage within the framework of liability proceedings, domestic courts may be called upon to consider the age of claimants, as in the instant case. The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a fifty - year - old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to child-bearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self -fulfilment of women as people. Apart from being, in a way, judgmental, it omitted to take into consideration other dimensions of women ’ s sexuality in the specific case of the applicant. In other words, in the instant case the Supreme Administrative Court made a general assumption without attempting to look at its validity in the specific case of the applicant herself, who was fifty at the time of the operation at issue ( see, mutatis mutandis, Schuler- Zgraggen, cited above, § 67)."

As a consequence, she had difficulty walking, sitting and having sexual relations, which, all together, made her feel diminished as a woman. Consequently, the applicant was also depressed, had suicidal thoughts and avoided contact with members of her family and friends.

In respect of pecuniary damage, the Lisbon Administrative Court awarded her EUR 92,000, of which EUR 16,000 was for the services of a maid the applicant had had to hire to help her with household tasks."

The relevant part of the judgment on those points reads as follows:",

                "Indeed, (1) it has not been established that the plaintiff had lost her capacity to take care of domestic tasks, (2) professional activity outside the home is one thing while domestic work is another, and (3) considering the age of her children, she [the plaintiff] probably only needed to take care of her husband; this leads us to the conclusion that she did not need to hire a full - time maid ...",
                "Lastly, as regards non-pecuniary damage, it is important to set an amount which compensates the plaintiff for her pain and loss of sensation and swelling in the vaginal area, and for the difficulty sitting and walking, which causes her distress and prevents her from going about her everyday life, forcing her to use sanitary towels on a daily basis to conceal urinary and faecal incontinence and which has limited her sexual activity, making her feel diminished as a woman. In addition, there is no medical solution to her condition. All this has caused her severe depression, expressing itself in anxiety and somatic symptoms manifested in the difficulty she has sleeping, deep disgust and frustration with the situation in which she finds herself, which has turned her into a very unhappy person and which inhibits her from establishing relationships with others and has caused her to stop visiting family and friends, from going to the beach and theatre and which has given her suicidal thoughts.",
                "It should be noted, however, that the plaintiff has been suffering from the gynaecological condition for a long time (at least since 1993) and that she had already undergone various kinds of treatment without any acceptable result and that it was that lack of results and the impossibility of curing the condition otherwise that was the motivation for surgery. She had already had unbearable pain and symptoms of depression before [surgery]. This means that the plaintiff ’ s complaints are not new and that the surgical procedure only aggravated an already difficult situation, a fact which cannot be ignored when setting the amount of compensation.",
                "Additionally, it should not be forgotten that at the time of the operation the plaintiff was already 50 years old and had two children, that is, an age when sex is not as important as in younger years, its significance diminishing with age.",

The Special Rapporteur notes that the proper education and awareness-raising of judges and prosecutors are paramount for a better performance of judicial actors in the treatment of all victims of crimes. This is especially needed as a means to avoid the reproduction of prejudices in court rulings or the adoption of contradictory measures, for instance in relation to custody, which could facilitate the access of known aggressors to their victims. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts made by the Centre for Judicial Studies in providing training that pays particular attention to human rights and vulnerable groups.”",

                "29. A report by the Permanent Observatory on Portuguese Justice ( Observatório permanente da justiça portuguesa ), drafted at the request of the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality ( Comissão para a Cidadania e Igualdade de Género ), about how the judicial authorities deal with cases of domestic violence, was published in November 2016 [1]. It pointed out that the approach of magistrates to cases often differed, depending on the economic, cultural and social background of the accused. The report also expressed concerns over prevailing legal and institutional sexism. It referred by way of example to a judgment concerning a man who had physically assaulted his wife and the fact that she was having sexual intercourse with other men was viewed as a mitigating factor (pp. 231-32 of the report).",

An individual ’ s physical and moral integrity fell within the notion of “private life” and was protected by Article 8 of the Convention. In that regard, they noted that the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court had sought, inter alia, to provide the applicant with adequate compensation for the damage caused by the surgical procedure to her physical and psychological integrity, which had had an impact on both her health and her well-being. In addition, the Government observed that the applicant had complained of discriminatory treatment on the grounds of sex and age, elements which formed part of an individual ’ s personality and therefore included the concept of private life. The Government concluded therefore that the circumstances of the case fell within the scope of Article 8."

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention, and to this extent it is autonomous. A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may, however, infringe that Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is discriminatory in nature. Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable, it is enough that the facts of the case fall “within the ambit” of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, among many other authorities, Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v. Russia [GC], nos. 60367/08 and 961/11, § 53, 24 January 2017, and Fabris v. France [GC], no. 16574/08, § 47, ECHR 2013 (extracts) )."

It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual ’ s physical and social identity (see Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 159, 24 January 2017 ). The concept of private life also encompasses the right to “personal development” or the right to self-determination ( ibidem ) and elements such as gender identification, sexual orientation and sex life, which fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see E.B. v.

In fact, her faecal and urinary incontinence, the difficulty in having sex and her depression had been caused exclusively by the medical error which had occurred during the operation."

In the applicant ’ s opinion, by expressly referring to the fact that she was fifty the Supreme Court had implied that if she had been younger and had had no children, she would most certainly have been awarded a higher amount. Moreover, the Supreme Administrative Court had made an assumption which had lacked a scientific basis. By disregarding her right to a sex life, the Supreme Administrative Court had breached one of the most basic principles of human dignity and had violated Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. The applicant contended that the analysis of Portuguese case-law referred to above (see paragraphs 23 and 24 ) led to the conclusion that there was an obvious difference in treatment regarding compensation for men and women in situations involving their sex life. In particular, the amount awarded to men for non-pecuniary damage seemed to be manifestly higher in situations where plaintiffs had similar problems to those the applicant had suffered from following the medical intervention in question."

The Government argued that the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s decision to decrease the amount awarded by the first-instance court in respect of non-pecuniary damage had not been governed by prejudice or an intention to discriminate against the applicant on the grounds of her sex or age. On the contrary, it had been based on the fact that the Supreme Administrative Court had considered that the medical intervention had not been the only cause of the physical and psychological damage which the applicant had complained of. In that regard the Government emphasised that the amount awarded by the Supreme Administrative Court had been attributable to the fact that the applicant ’ s gynaecological problem had developed a long time earlier, that she had already been treated unsuccessfully several times and that she had already been suffering unbearable pain and symptoms of depression before the operation. For the Supreme Administrative Court, therefore, the applicant ’ s complains had not been new and surgery had merely aggravated what had already been a difficult situation. Moreover, the Government pointed out that the Supreme Administrative Court had also taken into account the fact that the applicant had become very unhappy and that she had felt “diminished as a woman” in the wake of the injury she had suffered."

They further acknowledged that there had been an unfortunate use of terms. They observed, however, that the passage should be read on the understanding that the Supreme Administrative Court had also taken the above-mentioned factors into account."

In addition, the Government argued that comparing cases that had come before Portuguese courts was difficult and was liable to lead to errors because the clinical conditions of the plaintiffs seeking compensation were different and, as such, the physical and psychological consequences of the damage involved also differed. They noted that several factors had to be taken into account when assessing appropriate levels of compensation for non-pecuniary damage. These included any life- threatening risks; the number of medical procedures plaintiffs had undergone; the kind of treatment ( the degree of pain) applied; whether the injuries caused by the medical error could be reversed; and the degree of loss of autonomy and subsequent dependence on others in the essential tasks of everyday life. In that regard, the applicant could not be considered as being in the same position as other plaintiffs (including the male plaintiffs referred to in the two Supreme Court of Justice judgments in paragraphs 23 and 24 above). As such, the amount awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage had not amounted to an unjustifiable difference in treatment on account of her sex and age as it had been proportionate to the damage suffered."

            [
                "44. The Court has established in its case-law that in order for an issue to arise under Article 14, there must be a difference in treatment of persons in analogous or relevantly similar situations. Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment (see, inter alia, Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, § § 90 and 93, ECHR 2016, and Sousa Goucha v. Portugal, no. 70434/12, § 58, 22 March 2016). The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v. Russia [GC], nos. 60367/08 and 961/11, § 64, ECHR 2017)."

                "45. Article 14 does not prohibit all differences in treatment, but only those differences based on an identifiable, objective or personal characteristic, or “status”, by which individuals or groups are distinguishable from one another. It lists specific grounds which constitute “status” including, inter alia, sex, race and property. The words “other status” have generally been given a wide meaning, and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, §§ 61 and 70, ECHR 2010, and Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, § § 56-58, 13 July 2010 ). In this regard, the Court has recognised that age might constitute “other status” for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention (see, for example, Schwizgebel v. Switzerland, no. 25762/07, § 85, ECHR 2010 (extracts) ), although it has not, to date, suggested that discrimination on grounds of age should be equated with other “suspect” grounds of discrimination ( British Gurkha Welfare Society and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44818/11, § 88, 15 September 2016)."

The Court further reiterates that the advancement of gender equality is today a major goal for the member States of the Council of Europe and very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before such a difference of treatment could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 127, with further references; see also Schuler- Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 263). In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country are insufficient justification for a difference in treatment on the grounds of sex. For example, in a case concerning the bearing of a woman ’ s maiden name after marriage, it considered that the importance attached to the principle of non-discrimination prevented States from imposing traditions that derive from the man ’ s primordial role and the woman ’ s secondary role in the family (see Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 63, ECHR 2004 ‑ X (extracts) ). The Court has also considered that the issue with stereotyping of a certain group in society lies in the fact that it prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacity and needs (see, mutatis mutandis, Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010, with further references)."

Moreover, the Supreme Administrative Court relied on the fact that the applicant “ [had been] already fifty years old at the time of the surgery and had two children, that is, an age when sexuality [was] not as important as in younger years, its significance diminishing with age ” (see paragraph 16 above)."

The national authorities are thus, in principle, better placed than an international court to evaluate what is adequate compensation for the specific damage suffered by an individual. The issue which has to be determined, however, is whether or not the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s reasoning led to a difference of treatment of the applicant based on her sex and age, amounting to a breach of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8."

The Court acknowledges that in deciding claims related to non-pecuniary damage within the framework of liability proceedings, domestic courts may be called upon to consider the age of claimants, as in the instant case. The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a fifty - year - old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to child-bearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self -fulfilment of women as people. Apart from being, in a way, judgmental, it omitted to take into consideration other dimensions of women ’ s sexuality in the specific case of the applicant. In other words, in the instant case the Supreme Administrative Court made a general assumption without attempting to look at its validity in the specific case of the applicant herself, who was fifty at the time of the operation at issue ( see, mutatis mutandis, Schuler- Zgraggen, cited above, § 67)."

It is true that in lowering the amount the Supreme Administrative Court also took it for granted that the pain suffered by the applicant was not new. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s age and sex appear to have been decisive factors in the final decision, introducing a difference of treatment based on those grounds (see, mutatis mutandis, Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, § 35, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; Schuler- Zgraggen, cited above, § 67; and, conversely, Sousa Goucha, cited above, §§ 64-65).

The Supreme Court of Justice found in those cases that the fact that the men could no longer have normal sexual relations had affected their self-esteem and resulted in a “tremendous blow ” and “ severe mental trauma ” (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In view of its findings, the Supreme Court of Justice awarded EUR 224,459 and EUR 100,000 to the two male plaintiffs respectively. It follows from those cases that the domestic courts took into consideration the fact that the men could not have sexual relations and how that had affected them, regardless of their age. Contrary to the applicant ’ s case, the Supreme Court of Justice did not take account of whether the plaintiffs already had children or not, or look at any other factors.

Firstly, the Court sees no reason to question the difference in treatment of the group of adult offenders to which the applicants belong, who are not exempted from life imprisonment, as compared to that of juvenile offenders who are so exempted. Indeed, the exemption of juvenile offenders from life imprisonment is consonant with the approach that is common to the legal systems of all the Contracting States, without exception, namely the abolition of life imprisonment for offenders considered juveniles under their respective domestic laws (see paragraph 20 above). The said exemption is also consistent with the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons below the age of 18 and with the UN General Assembly’s Resolution inviting the States to consider repealing all forms of life imprisonment for such persons (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Its purpose is evidently to facilitate the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents. The Court considers that when young offenders are held accountable for their deeds, however serious, this must be done with due regard for their presumed immaturity, both mental and emotional, as well as the greater malleability of their personality and their capacity for rehabilitation and reformation."

The applicants pointed out that they were not seeking universal application of life sentences to all offenders, including women, and men aged under 18 or over 65.

As regards the gender-related difference in treatment, the applicants considered that the difference in the sentencing of male and female offenders had no reasonable or objective justification. It was the product of an outdated and traditionalist view of the social role of women and was not founded on any scientific evidence, statistical data or generally accepted legal principles. Women’s allegedly special role in society, which related, above all, to their reproductive function and childrearing, did not amount to a sufficient ground for treating female offenders more favourably than male ones. Irrespective of the biological differences between men and women, both sexes participated in caring for, protecting and supporting their children. National laws did not differentiate between the rights and obligations of a mother and a father in a child’s upbringing. The Court had found that gender stereotypes, such as the perception of women as primary child-carers could not, in themselves, be considered to amount to sufficient justification for a difference in treatment (here the applicants referred to Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 143, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). In any event, the difference in sentencing would not achieve the purported objective of the protection of motherhood because a difference between a thirty-year prison sentence and a life sentence could not be decisive for a woman’s reproductive ability if, in either case, she was bound to spend the childbearing years of her life in prison."

The applicants acknowledged that the physiological characteristics of certain categories of women – and at specific times, for example during pregnancy, breastfeeding or childrearing – could constitute a reasonable and objective justification for a difference of treatment. However, Article 57 of the Criminal Code assumed that there were universal physiological characteristics that differentiated male and female offenders for all purposes and at all times. The excessive breadth of the Government’s differentiation became striking in comparison with generally recognised norms in which only specific factors relating to women were taken into consideration. Thus, Article 6 § 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibited capital punishment of pregnant women because of considerations relating to their unborn child. In the same way, Article 76 § 3 of the First Protocol Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflict) sought to prohibit the pronouncement and execution of the death penalty on women who were pregnant or had dependent infants."

The applicants asserted that Article 57 of the Criminal Code, which laid down a permanent and immutable distinction between offenders on the basis of their sex, even if every other aspect of their circumstances was identical, did not pursue any legitimate aim. By making this distinction as a matter of law, rather than, for example, allowing the judge to take account of gender as an element in exercising sentencing discretion, a relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised was lacking. To the extent that particular circumstances relating to gender could legitimately be taken into account, there was no need for institutionalised gender-based distinctions, since the courts could consider personal circumstances, including family status and child-support needs and obligations, in the framework of the general principles of sentencing policy under Russian law when deciding on the appropriate punishment for both men and women."

Of those, Article 37(a) was the only provision directly applicable to the case in so far as it prohibited sentencing juvenile offenders to life imprisonment without a right to release on parole; however, it was still not relevant in the Russian context where any category of convicted prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, regardless of their age, could be released on parole after twenty-five years."

Age-related differences in sentencing could be necessary if persons aged 65 or over were to be treated as a vulnerable social group who had an underdeveloped or weakened capacity to control their conduct or foresee the consequences of their actions. Yet there were no scientific studies demonstrating diminished responsibility in all persons aged over 65. If all persons over 65 were to be considered irresponsible, the fact that such individuals were eligible under Russian law to hold important public offices, including that of judges of the Constitutional Court up to the age of 75, undermined the validity of the age-related generalisation. Furthermore, taking into account that the average life expectancy was 65 years for Russian men and that those statistics did not reflect the poor conditions of detention in Russian prison facilities which must further reduce life expectancy for inmates, the effect of a life sentence on a forty-year-old offender was hardly any different from that on a sixty-five-year-old: both had illusory chances of early release on parole. Thus, the age-limit established at 65 years was arbitrary, especially taking into account that the retirement age was set at 55 years for women and 60 years for men."

The restrictions concerning those categories of offenders did not affect the sentencing of other offenders, in respect of whom the sentences reflected the nature of the crime and the danger posed to the public by it, the circumstances in which it was committed, and the personality of the offender. In the Government’s view, the case-law of the Constitutional Court reflected the requirements of international law concerning a differentiated approach to punishment according to the offender’s sex and age. They referred, as regards juvenile offenders, to Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the position of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and that of the Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly’s Resolution of 9 November 2012 [1] and other international instruments, as well as to the fact that a vast majority of member States had abolished life imprisonment for children. As to offenders aged 65 or over, the Government pointed out that life imprisonment of 65-year-olds would make them eligible for release on parole only at the age of 90, which was an illusory possibility having regard to life expectancy."

The Government further pointed out that international law provided for a more humane approach towards women, while the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stated that special measures aimed at protecting maternity were not to be considered discriminatory (CEDAW) (Article 4 § 2). They referred to certain scientific studies according to which women constituted a minority of detainees worldwide. Women were often the primary carers of children before incarceration and up to 90 percent of them had a history of domestic abuse which contributed to their criminal conduct and emphasised their vulnerability. According to the Government, Russia was not the only State that did not sentence women to life imprisonment; other States included Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Uzbekistan. The Ukrainian Parliament had adopted, at first reading, a draft law exempting women from life sentences."

                "46. Russian law established as a general rule that a life sentence could be imposed for particularly serious crimes against life and public safety. The prohibition on sentencing female and juvenile offenders and offenders aged 65 or over to life imprisonment was an exception to the rule. This exception did not infringe the rights of the majority of convicted prisoners, but rather established a privileged approach to sentencing for specific groups of individuals. It could be described as “positive inequality” designed to make up, by legal means, for the naturally vulnerable position of those social groups. In the Government’s submission, the concept of discrimination referred only to unjustified restrictions. In that sense, there was no discrimination in the applicants’ case, and their grievances were of an abstract nature because their sentences had been determined in accordance with the gravity of the crimes they had committed and did not put them at any disadvantage vis-à-vis women, juveniles or persons aged 65 or over."

            [
                "47. On the issue of whether a difference in treatment was reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the Government submitted that age-related restrictions were necessary because juveniles and persons aged 65 or over were vulnerable social groups who had an underdeveloped or weakened capacity to understand the implications of their conduct, to control it or to foresee the consequences of their actions. They were prone to impulsive, unconsidered behaviour that could result in criminally reprehensible conduct. As to women, the sentencing exception was justified in view of their special role in society which related, above all, to their reproductive function. The Russian Constitutional Court had previously held that a different retirement age for men and women was justified not only by physiological differences between the sexes but also by the special role of motherhood in society, and did not amount to discrimination but rather served to reinforce effective, rather than formal, equality."

In sum, the Government believed that, given the biological, psychological, sociological and other particular features of female offenders, young offenders and offenders aged 65 or over, sentencing them to life imprisonment and their incarceration in harsh conditions would undermine the penological objective of their rehabilitation. Besides, the exception concerned in reality a small number of convicted persons. In Russia, as of 1 November 2011, only 1,802 offenders had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Of the total number of 533,024 prisoners, only 42,511 were female."

The third party, Equal Rights Trust, submitted that, with the exception of provisions relating to juvenile offenders, blanket rules which exempted particular groups from life imprisonment could not be justified under Article 14.

The third party indicated that references to “positive discrimination” in the context of this case were misplaced and not in accordance with the meaning of this notion in international law. Positive action was a necessary element of the right to equality and it included a range of measures to overcome past disadvantage. The measures taken must be designed to address the disadvantage identified and the State must be able to show on what basis they had concluded that the measures chosen would attain that objective. However, a blanket exemption of women from a certain type of sentence was not temporary and did not pursue any objective linked to the equality of opportunity or treatment. Article 4(2) of the CEDAW was a narrow provision relating to treatment of pregnant women and new mothers and could not be used to justify a difference in treatment of women on the basis of biological difference outside that context or to justify differences in treatment based on a perceived social role of women as mothers. Special measures for pregnant women and new mothers must be limited to what was strictly necessary (reference was made to Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, ECJ, Case C-222/84, 15 May 1986, §§ 44-46). Courts had consistently rejected arguments based on paternalism and perceptions that women were more “vulnerable” than men and in need of “protection” (they referred to Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany, no. 13580/88, 18 July 1994, § 28, Series A no. 291 ‑ B, concerning the exemption of women from service compulsory for men on the basis of women’s “physical and mental characteristics”, and Emel Boyraz v.

Generalisation as to a measure’s ability to achieve a legitimate objective was insufficient ( Age Concern England, ECJ, Case C-388/07, 5 March 2009, § 51). Even if it was shown that a life sentence would more often be considered unduly harsh in the cases of persons aged over 65 than persons under 65, a blanket exemption was not necessarily a proportionate means of achieving the aim of avoiding harsh sentences. Age was not binary and any distinctions on the basis of age, where a cut-off point was identified, could call for a comparative analysis of State practice and scientific evidence when considering whether a measure was justified."

Regarding ways of remedying the existing situation, the third party submitted that if a State, acting at its discretion, decided that a life sentence was “inhumane” if imposed on certain groups, and this was found to be in violation of Article 14, the principle of “no levelling down” would mean that a State could not remedy that discrimination by simply removing the more favourable treatment from the protected groups. In accordance with international legal principles and customary international law, the implementation of decisions of international tribunals should not abolish, restrict, or limit existing rights (reference was made to Article 53 of the Convention). Once the State had reduced the limitations on the right to liberty of a group of persons, it could not justify the reversal of this progress by reference to its obligation under the Convention. Instead, the third party submitted that, in order to comply with Article 14, the State should adopt an individualised approach to sentencing, which took into account, among other things, the offender’s particular characteristics. An individualised approach would allow for a more nuanced calibrating of sentencing to the specific vulnerabilities of narrowly defined categories of individuals, as opposed to the overly broad and therefore arbitrary distinctions on the basis of gender or age.",

However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention, and to this extent it is autonomous. A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe the Article when read in conjunction with Article 14, for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature. Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable, it suffices that the facts of the case fall “within the ambit” of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, § 41, 13 July 2010; Kafkaris v.

Similarly, again in the context of the execution of a criminal sentence, in a case concerning eligibility of a life prisoner for parole, the Court considered that “although Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention does not guarantee a right to automatic parole, an issue may arise under that provision taken together with Article 14 of the Convention if a settled sentencing policy affects individuals in a discriminatory manner” (see Gerger v.

For the same reason, it is not for the Court to determine when that review should take place. This being said, the Court would also observe that the comparative and international law materials before it show clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter ....",

A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.”"

The Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see Klass and Others v.

The applicants were sentenced to life imprisonment following an adversarial trial during which they were able to submit arguments in their defence and to state their view on the appropriate punishment. Although they had initially alleged that the criminal proceedings against them had been marred by procedural deficiencies, the Court, after careful consideration of their complaints, rejected them as unsubstantiated (see the decisions of 27 September 2011 and 13 May 2014 in paragraph 4 above). The outcome of the applicants’ trials was decided on the specific facts of their cases and their sentences were the product of individualised application of criminal law by the trial court whose discretion in the choice of appropriate sentence was not curtailed on account of the requirements prescribed in paragraph 2 of Article 57 of the Criminal Code. In these circumstances, in view of the penological objectives of the protection of society and general and individual deterrence, the life sentences imposed on the applicants do not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. Moreover, the applicants will be eligible for early release after the first twenty-five years provided that they have fully abided by the prison regulations in the previous three years (Article 79 § 5 of the Criminal Code); accordingly, no issues comparable to those in the above-cited judgments of Vinter and Others or, more recently, Murray arise in the instant case."

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background, but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court (see Konstantin Markin v.

On the one hand, the Court has repeatedly held that differences based on sex require particularly serious reasons by way of justification and that references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country cannot, by themselves, be considered to amount to sufficient justification for a difference in treatment, any more than similar stereotypes based on race, origin, colour or sexual orientation (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 127; X and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 19010/07, § 99, ECHR 2013; Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 77; and Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 109, ECHR 2014). On the other hand, as the Court has also stated, it is not its role to decide what is the appropriate term of detention applicable to a particular offence or to pronounce on the appropriate length of detention or other sentence which should be served by a person after conviction by a competent court (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 105; see also T. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 117; V. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 118; and Sawoniuk, cited above)."

An additional factor relevant for determining the extent to which the respondent State should be afforded a margin of appreciation is the existence or non-existence of a European consensus. Since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Schwizgebel, cited above, §§ 79-80; Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 81, ECHR 2007-V; Fretté v.

Firstly, the Court sees no reason to question the difference in treatment of the group of adult offenders to which the applicants belong, who are not exempted from life imprisonment, as compared to that of juvenile offenders who are so exempted. Indeed, the exemption of juvenile offenders from life imprisonment is consonant with the approach that is common to the legal systems of all the Contracting States, without exception, namely the abolition of life imprisonment for offenders considered juveniles under their respective domestic laws (see paragraph 20 above). The said exemption is also consistent with the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons below the age of 18 and with the UN General Assembly’s Resolution inviting the States to consider repealing all forms of life imprisonment for such persons (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Its purpose is evidently to facilitate the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents. The Court considers that when young offenders are held accountable for their deeds, however serious, this must be done with due regard for their presumed immaturity, both mental and emotional, as well as the greater malleability of their personality and their capacity for rehabilitation and reformation."

                "81. Secondly, in so far as the applicants complained of being treated differently from offenders aged 65 or over – the other age group exempted from life imprisonment – it is to be noted that, according to the above-mentioned Vinter principles, a life sentence will be compatible with Article 3 only if there is a prospect of release and a possibility for review (both of which must exist from the time of imposition of the sentence). Against the background of this Convention requirement, the Court sees no grounds for considering that the relevant domestic provision excluding offenders aged 65 or over from life imprisonment had no objective and reasonable justification. As can be seen from the material before the Court, the purpose of that provision in principle coincides with the interests underlying the eligibility for early release after the first twenty-five years for adult male offenders aged under 65, such as the applicants, noted in Vinter as being a common approach in national jurisdictions where life imprisonment can be imposed (see paragraph 74 above). Reducibility of a life sentence carries even greater weight for elderly offenders in order not to become a mere illusory possibility. By limiting the imposition of life sentences through providing for a maximum age limit, the Russian legislature used one among several methods at its disposal for securing a prospect of release for a reasonable number of prisoners and thus acted within its margin of appreciation in line with Convention standards."

            [
                "82. Thirdly, in so far as the applicants felt aggrieved by being treated differently from adult female offenders of the same age group as theirs (18 to 65) and who were exempted from life imprisonment on account of their gender, the Court has taken note of various European and international instruments addressing the needs of women for protection against gender-based violence, abuse and sexual harassment in the prison environment, as well as the needs for protection of pregnancy and motherhood (see paragraphs 27 to 30 above). The Government provided statistical data showing a considerable difference between the total number of male and female prison inmates (see paragraph 48 above). They also pointed to the relatively small number of persons sentenced to life imprisonment (ibid.). It is not for the Court to reassess the evaluation made by the domestic authorities of the data in their possession or of the penological rationale which such data purports to demonstrate. In the particular circumstances of the case, the available data, as well as the above elements, provide a sufficient basis for the Court to conclude that there exists a public interest underlying the exemption of female offenders from life imprisonment by way of a general rule."

            [
                "83. It is further observed that, beyond the consensus not to impose life imprisonment on juvenile offenders and to provide for a subsequent review in those jurisdictions which do so for adult offenders (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 120), there is little common ground between the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States in this area. Whilst life imprisonment does not exist in nine Contracting States, either because no such sentences are available or because they have been abolished at some point in time (see paragraph 19 above), a majority of the Contracting States have opted for retaining the possibility of sentencing offenders for life in cases of particularly serious crimes. Within the latter group, there is no uniformity as to the age up to which the exemption from life imprisonment applies; many States have fixed the age at 18 years, in others it varies between 18 and 21 years (see paragraph 20 above)."
            ],
            [
                "84. The disparity in approach to other groups of offenders which Contracting States have chosen to exempt from life imprisonment is even more salient. Some Contracting States have established a specific sentencing regime for offenders who have reached the age of between 60 and 65 (see paragraph 21 above). Other Contracting States have decided to exempt female offenders who were pregnant at the time of the offence or at the time of sentencing from life sentences. Yet another group of States, including Russia, have extended this approach to all female offenders (see paragraph 22 above)."

The Court considers it quite natural that the national authorities, whose duty it is also to consider, within the limits of their jurisdiction, the interests of society as a whole, should enjoy broad discretion when they are asked to make rulings on sensitive matters such as penal policy. Moreover, the area in question should still be regarded as one of evolving rights, with no established consensus, in which States must also enjoy a margin of appreciation in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes (compare Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, no. 30141/04, § 105, ECHR 2010). Since the delicate issues raised in the present case touch on areas where there is little common ground amongst the member States of the Council of Europe and, generally speaking, the law appears to be in a transitional stage, a wide margin of appreciation must be left to the authorities of each State."

            [
                "86. It therefore appears difficult to criticise the Russian legislature for having established, in a way which reflects the evolution of society in that sphere, the exemption of certain groups of offenders from life imprisonment. Such an exemption represents, all things considered, social progress in penological matters (compare Petrovic, cited above, § 41). The situation obtaining in the instant case is different from that in those cases where the Court was able to note a widespread and consistently developing consensus and associated legal changes to the domestic laws of Contracting States concerning a specific issue (compare Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 140; Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 104, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; and Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 91). The Court is unable to discern an international trend in favour of abolishing life imprisonment or, on the contrary, confirming positive support for it. It notes however that life imprisonment in Europe has become limited in the sense of the requirement of reducibility of the sentence (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 119) which may in future require further positive obligations on the part of the member States (see, for example, Murray, cited above, §§ 124 ‑ 125). In the absence of common ground regarding the imposition of life imprisonment, the Russian authorities have not overstepped their margin of appreciation. Notwithstanding a more favourable position in which the perpetrators of offences comparable to those committed by the applicants have found themselves, the legislation on whose basis the punishments were served on the applicants and which is being challenged by them is not in breach of the applicable international law or markedly at variance with the solutions adopted by other member States of the Council of Europe in this sphere (compare Schwizgebel, cited above, § 92)."

In sum, while it would clearly be possible for the respondent State, in pursuit of its aim of promoting the principles of justice and humanity, to extend the exemption from life imprisonment to all categories of offenders, it is not required to do so under the Convention as currently interpreted by the Court. Moreover, in view of the practical operation of life imprisonment in the Russian Federation, both as to the manner of its imposition and to a possibility of subsequent review, the interests of the society as a whole as far as they are compatible with the Convention and having regard to the wide margin of appreciation which the Court has found that the respondent Government enjoy in this context, the Court is satisfied that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim pursued. It concludes that the impugned exemptions did not constitute a prohibited difference in treatment for the purposes of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5.

A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person ’ s home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference ( see ECtHR judgment Moreno v. Spain, 16 November 2004, ECHR Reports 2004-X p. 307 § 53).",
                "4.2 According to the constant case-law of the ECtHR, Art. 8 ECHR does not give rise to direct entitlement to social insurance benefits. The Court has indeed acknowledged that while the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, there may, in certain circumstances, be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, among other authorities, Botta, § 33). However, it has held that Art. 8 ECHR does not impose on the Contracting States any obligation to provide specific financial assistance or to guarantee a specific standard of living ( see Petrovic v. Austria, 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II p. 579 § 26 et seq., and the inadmissibility decision in Pancenko v. Latvia, 28 October 1999). That provision places no restriction on the Contracting States ’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, 12 April 2006, ECHR Reports 2006-VI p. 159, § 53). The ECtHR has thus considered that a refusal to grant a parental leave allowance cannot amount to a failure to respect family life, since Article 8 of the Convention does not impose any positive obligation on States to provide the financial assistance in question ( see Petrovic, § 26).",
                "Consequently, given that Art. 8 ECHR does not give rise to entitlement to a specific standard of living or to a positive obligation to provide a social insurance benefit, the withdrawal of the benefits in question owing to the insured person ’ s departure from Switzerland does not amount to an interference with private or family life. Nor does this measure impinge on the necessary respect for the home within the meaning of Art. 8 ( 1 ) ECHR and the European Court ’ s case-law, which the appellants have interpreted broadly, as it does not involve any practical infringement of the area in which their private and family life develops. Furthermore, it is plain that the appellants were not impeded by the Swiss authorities in their choice of way of life and the development of their family relations in Switzerland or abroad; in particular, they were not prevented from maintaining family and social relations in this country, from settling in it or leaving it as they wished.",
                "It should be pointed out here that in all cases where the European Court has considered a denial of specific social insurance benefits in the light of the rights secured under the ECHR, it has relied on Protocol No. 1 of 20 March 1952 to the ECHR, as, for example, in Moskal v. Poland, 15 September 2009, § § 93 et seq ., cited by the appellants ( see also Stec and Others, § 53, and Koua Poirrez v France, 30 September 2003, ECHR Reports 2003-X p. 45 § § 43 et seq. ). Since Switzerland has not ratified that protocol, it is not bound by the Court ’ s case-law concerning the non- discriminatory granting of social security benefits based on Article 1 of the protocol.",
                "4.3 Contrary to the appellants ’ subsequent submissions, the withdrawal of the social insurance benefits in question does not, from a thematic perspective, fall within the scope of Art. 8 ECHR, which would enable them to pray in aid Art. 14 ECHR. That provision, which complements the other substantive provisions of the ECHR, can apply in the absence of an infringement of those provisions, provided that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of them (see, among many other authorities, Konstantin Markin v Russia, 22 March 2012, § 129 ...).",
                "Generally speaking, the insurance invalidity benefit provided for in Swiss law is a social insurance benefit designed to offset the loss of earnings sustained by an insured person on account of the effects of a health impairment on his or her ability to work, or to compensate for an inability to perform everyday actions as a result of a health problem. The extraordinary invalidity pension pursues the same aim for individuals who have been disabled since birth ( or have become disabled without having acquired entitlement to an ordinary pension ). As regards the invalidity allowance, it is awarded on the basis of a long-term need for assistance by others or for the personal supervision of the insured person concerned in performing ordinary everyday actions on account of a health impairment.",
                "Those social insurance benefits are paid regardless of the beneficiaries ’ lifestyle, that is, irrespective of whether they live alone, with family or in an institution ( with certain exceptions irrelevant to the present case: see, for example, section 42 ( 5 ) LAI and section 35bis ( 3 ) RAI). From that angle, the benefits are, precisely, intended to enable adult beneficiaries to lead as autonomous a life as possible, without having to depend on help and assistance from members of their families. They are not designed to promote family life or to intervene in personal or family relationships. Contrary to the examples cited by the appellants, and according to a legal opinion to which they refer (Matthias Kradolfer, op. cit., p. 73), to wit a parental leave allowance ( see Petrovic, § 27) and an ‘ assistance pension ’ paid to the parents of a disabled child ( see Moskal v Poland § 93), the Swiss extraordinary invalidity pension and disability allowance are not aimed at enabling one of the parents to remain at home in order to look after their (adult) child. Accordingly, the withdrawal of those benefits on account of the non-fulfilment of the criterion of ordinary residence in Switzerland laid down in domestic law does not fall within the scope of Article 8 ECHR. ”"

Persons who have been disabled since birth or childhood cannot fulfil that condition, given that they were unable to work before the age at which they would have begun to pay contributions.

It was first and foremost a mixed benefit : on the one hand it had specific social- security features in that the persons concerned had a clearly defined right to that benefit and it covered the invalidity risk; on the other hand it was also linked to social assistance in that it was not based on periods of work or contribution and was not aimed at mitigating a situation of need by providing a minimum living wage to a socially underprivileged group ( young persons with disabilities ). The extraordinary pension was also a special benefit, since it was an alternative allowance aimed at persons who did not fulfil the insurance conditions to obtain an ordinary invalidity pension; it was closely linked to the socio- economic situation in Switzerland, since it corresponded to the minimum pension in that State.

In particular, at the time of the 5 th revision of the LAI, whereas an initial draft had included the possibility of exporting the extraordinary pension, the final draft had dropped all mention of it."

That amounted to a disproportionate interference with their family life, because a separation, an emotional abandonment would be required to enable the disabled person to retain the same quality of life, whereas that would not have been the situation if payment of the pensions had continued, as in the case of a person who had become disabled as a result of an accident."

However, should the Court decide the opposite, namely that the first applicant ’ s situation was comparable to that of a person having contributed to the insurance scheme, and even assume that the two types of pension (contributory/non-contributory) were not sufficiently different to justify different types of regulations, the Government considered that the different conditions applicable to the two types of pension were justified on grounds inherent in insurance law."

The preservation of that solidarity mechanism depended on the will and the trust of other people, which required it to be subject to certain limits. Thus the Government considered that the impugned legislation had pursued a legitimate aim, that is, the country ’ s economic well-being. They explained that the social security system was an extremely complex State construction which comprised a balanced and coordinated set of measures to protect the population against the vicissitudes of life. That system operated at considerable cost, which was defrayed by people living in Switzerland.

On the other hand, extraordinary invalidity pensions were, with some reservations, equal to the minimum amount of the corresponding full ordinary pensions, and they did not depend on any loss of earnings or average annual income, but corresponded to a lump sum, that is to say the minimum pension.

Furthermore, extraordinary disability-insurance pensions had been included on the list of that type of benefit (Annex X to Regulation no. 883/224/EC).

It followed that the arrangements for paying the benefits in question, as recognised and accept by the States Parties to the ALCP in the light of the specific features of special non- contributory cash benefits, could not be deemed contrary to the Convention. The Government stated that the same reasoning also applied to the disability allowance (Article 42 ( 1 ) LAI), as the States Parties to the ALCP had recognised the close link with Switzerland on account of the non-contributory nature of that benefit ( see ATF 142 V 2, point 6, and paragraph 42 above )."

Moreover, since her daughter has no capacity of discernment, the second applicant, as her guardian, necessarily originated the domestic proceedings to which both applicants were admitted as parties by the Swiss courts.

In connection with the purpose of the measure, the applicants consider that they have been discriminated against as compared to disable persons who, in particular following an accident or illness, are entitled to export their invalidity pensions. The Government submitted that the situation of a beneficiary of an ordinary invalidity pension differed from that of the first applicant in that only in the former case had the person in question contributed to the Swiss social insurance scheme. The Court considers that the aim of these two types of pension is to guarantee disability income in two different types of situation : in the case of the ordinary invalidity pension for persons having contributed to the invalidity insurance system, and in the case of the disability allowance and the extraordinary invalidity insurance pension for persons who have not contributed to the invalidity insurance system. The Court takes the view that as regards the comparability of these two situations, the mere fact that the applicants have not contributed to the system is not decisive. On the other hand, that fact will be taken into account in the reasons given for the unequal treatment, which will be examined below ( see paragraphs 104-114)."

In that regard, the Court considers that the following conclusions may be drawn from the analysis of comparative law and of European Union law : first of all, it would appear that the distinction between contributory and non- contributory benefits is indeed confirmed in the Council of Europe member States ( see paragraph 31 above ) and represents the general rule in European law ( see paragraphs 32-39 above ). There is, therefore, nothing unusual or arbitrary about it. Secondly, the classification as “non- contributory benefits” of the two benefits in issue in the present case, to wit, an extraordinary invalidity pension and a disability allowance, is in conformity with the practice of Council of Europe member States and with EU law. Thirdly, it cannot be overlooked that the fact of making entitlement to non-contributory benefits subject to a condition of residence in the paying country is the general rule in almost all the member countries of the Council of Europe and in all three Council of Europe non-member States compared (see paragraph 31 above).

In that regard, the Court considers particularly relevant the Government ’ s argument to the effect that a non-contributory benefit is supposed to guarantee that disabled persons who did not satisfy the conditions for obtaining an ordinary pension could benefit from the solidarity of others and have the requisite means of subsistence to live in Switzerland. However, it is not contrary to the Convention to hold that the preservation of that solidarity mechanism depends on the will and the trust of other people, which requires the grant of benefits to be subject to certain conditions, for example requiring beneficiaries to have their ordinary residence in Switzerland. It is reasonable for a State granting non-contributory benefits not to wish to pay them abroad, particularly if the cost of living in the foreign country in question is considerably lower."

He observed, in particular, that the French authorities had never demonstrated that the organisation of hunting through ACCAs resulted in better game management or improved safety. While small landowners currently had the option of banding together to create a plot of land with a surface area above the threshold and thus avoid having to join an ACCA, this had not been possible at the time the Louin ACCA had been set up, and the law did not allow landowners to remove their land from the ACCA’s hunting grounds ex post facto, not even with a view to transferring it to a private entity that was coherent for hunting purposes. The principle of collective management of hunting grounds – which the applicant favoured, as the sole means of ensuring rational management of game stocks – did not necessitate a system of compulsory transfer of the kind provided for by the Loi Verdeille. That system resulted in the creation of collective hunting grounds on which third parties had the right to hunt against the wishes of the landowners, to the detriment of small landowners alone and on a “very small part of the country’s hunting land”. While he was not opposed to the creation of collective hunting grounds, the criteria applied for that purpose had to be rational. However, that was not the case with the surface area criterion employed by the Loi Verdeille, particularly since it applied to only a “very small part of the country’s hunting land”, was the sole criterion, was applied automatically and resulted in an irreversible situation."

This was a purely subjective view which was contradicted by the fact that the members of the ACCA did not necessarily share the same ideas regarding hunting or even the same hunting practices. It was also mistaken in so far as persons with automatic membership had to pay the annual subscription if they wished to hunt and small landowners whose land had been subjected to compulsory transfer of the hunting rights before they acquired it did not obtain automatic membership of the ACCA."

This not only deprived them of income but also affected the market value of the property. Furthermore, the ACCA was only required to make good any damage to their land caused by game within the limits of its liability for negligence under ordinary law.",

The legislature had drawn the necessary inferences from that judgment: since the entry into force of Law no. 2000-698 of 26 July 2000, landowners who did not hunt could object to the inclusion of their land if they were “opposed to hunting as a matter of personal conviction”, irrespective of the surface area of the land."

In this connection the Court points out that it was called upon in that case to deal specifically with the situation of landowners who were opposed to hunting for ethical reasons and who, prior to the entry into force of the Law of 26 July 2000, had no means of preventing hunting on their land unless the surface area exceeded a certain threshold beyond which objections could be raised."

The Court further stresses that, in the conclusion of its reasoning leading to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14, the Chassagnou and Others judgment stated that the difference in treatment between large and small landowners constituted discrimination on the ground of property within the meaning of Article 14 “since the result ... [was] to give only the former the right to use their land in accordance with their conscience” (§ 95).",
                "As regards the correct reading of this part of the Chassagnou and Others judgment, it is true that, in paragraphs 92-94, the Court expressed doubts as to the aim relied on by the Government (promoting the rational management of game stocks by pooling small hunting grounds) as justification for the difference in treatment between small and large landowners arising out of the French hunting legislation. However, that was not the basis on which the Court ultimately found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 read in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. It is clear from paragraph 95 that this finding was based on the fact that, within the category of landowners opposed to hunting for ethical reasons, only small landowners were obliged to tolerate the use of their property against their conscience. It was this fact that made the obligation on small landowners alone to participate in the system of ACCAs, giving rise to the impugned difference in treatment between large and small landowners, disproportionate to the aim pursued. In other words, it was the failure to respect the convictions of the landowners concerned which, in the end, led the Court to conclude that there had been no “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised” and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention."

The Court’s reasoning concerning the other complaints confirms that the fact that the applicants were obliged to participate in a system which went against their convictions was decisive. The Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on the ground that compelling small landowners to transfer hunting rights over their land so that others could “make use of them in a way which [was] totally incompatible with their beliefs” imposed a disproportionate burden which was not justified under the second paragraph of that provision (§ 85). It went on to find a violation of Article 11 of the Convention on the ground that to compel a person by law to “join an association such that it [was] fundamentally contrary to his own convictions to be a member of it”, and to oblige him, on account of his membership of that association, to transfer his rights over the land he owned so that the association in question could attain “objectives of which he disapprove[d]” went beyond what was necessary to ensure that a fair balance was struck between conflicting interests and could not be considered proportionate to the aim pursued (§ 117)."

The Committee of Ministers considered the judgment to have thereby been executed (see paragraph 24 above), and the Court held, in view of these new domestic-law provisions, that persons opposed to hunting on ethical grounds could no longer allege a violation of Article 11 of the Convention or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see A.S.P.A.S. and Lasgrezas v.

The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment. The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background (see, among many other authorities, Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 91, and, for a recent reference, Konstantin Markin v.

Secondly, whilst the criterion for making a distinction – “on the ground of property” – may in some circumstances give rise to discrimination prohibited by the Convention, it does not feature among the criteria regarded by the Court either as unacceptable as a matter of principle (as is the case with racial or ethnic origin; see, for instance, D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 176, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV, and Sejdić and Finci v.

                "The Conseil d’Etat went on to note that small landowners had a choice between relinquishing their hunting rights on the grounds that they were opposed to hunting as a matter of personal conviction, or transferring the hunting rights over their land to the ACCA. In view of the fact that landowners who hunted and who transferred their rights to an ACCA were entitled, by way of compensation, to automatic membership and had the right to hunt throughout the association’s hunting grounds, the Conseil d’Etat held that this system did not amount to disproportionate interference with the right to property. It also stressed that the difference in treatment between small and large landowners of which the applicant complained was based on “objective and reasonable” grounds since it had been introduced in the interests of hunters who owned small plots of land, who could thus join together to obtain larger hunting grounds. It added that the system was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since the owners of small plots of land remained free to use their land for a purpose in keeping with their conscience (see paragraph 17 above)."

This status was also held by \"citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies\".

To some extent the courts must have regard to them because there are provisions in the Act itself, particularly in section 19, which show that in appeals to an adjudicator, if the immigration rules have not been complied with, then the appeal is to be allowed. In addition the courts always have regard to those rules, not only in matters where there is a right of appeal; but also in cases under prerogative writs where there is a question whether officers have acted fairly.

It is true that ... the rules are given legal effect in the field of the appellate process to the adjudicator or the tribunal .... But the legal effect that the rules have in that limited field flows not from the fact that they have been published by the Minister and laid before Parliament, but because by section 19(2) of the [1971 Act] the rules are given an effect which is in a certain field clearly legally enforceable, and that is a quite different matter.\""

Where the applicant is a husband seeking to join or remain with his wife settled in the United Kingdom, factors which the Home Secretary will consider include the extent of her ties with that country and of the hardship she might suffer by going to live abroad, and any recommendations by the immigration appellate authorities (see paragraphs 34-37 below).",

The rules in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case were contained in the \"Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules\" (HC 394), laid before Parliament on 20 February 1980 (\"the 1980 Rules\"); they applied to all decisions taken on or after 1 March 1980, except those relating to applications made on or before 14 November 1979. A draft of the rules had previously been included in a White Paper published in November 1979.",
                "The 1980 Rules, which in paragraph 2 instructed immigration officers to carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of the intending entrant, detailed firstly the controls to be exercised on the entry into the United Kingdom of \"non-patrials\" and then those to be exercised after entry. The former depended on whether the individual concerned was coming for temporary purposes (for example, visitors or students), for employment or business or as a person of independent means, or for settlement. As under the rules previously in force, visitors were normally to be prohibited from taking employment and persons wishing to come for employment were subject to strict regulations as to work permits. The work-permit requirements, however, did not apply to nationals of other member States of the European Economic Community nor to persons covered by the \"United Kingdom ancestry rule\"; under the latter rule, which had been in force since the 1971 Act came into operation, a Commonwealth citizen having a grandparent born in the British Islands and wishing to take or seek employment in the United Kingdom could obtain indefinite leave to enter even without a work permit. A further exception was to be found in the \"working holiday rule\", whereby young Commonwealth citizens could, without a permit, take employment incidental to an extended holiday being spent in the United Kingdom; however, the period of their stay could, under the 1980 Rules, not exceed two years. All these exceptions have been maintained in subsequent immigration rules."

A particular feature of the changes introduced by the 1980 Rules was the inclusion of a number of provisions directed towards implementing a policy of protecting the domestic labour market at a time of high unemployment by curtailing \"primary immigration\", that is immigration by someone who could be expected to seek full-time work in order to support a family. In taking these measures, the Government were concerned also to advance public tranquillity and, by exercising firm and fair immigration control, to assist in securing good community relations.",
                "To these ends, among the changes effected was the introduction of stricter conditions for the grant of leave to a \"non-patrial\" husband or fiancé seeking to join or remain with his wife or fiancée settled in the United Kingdom. Previously, any such husband or fiancé would normally have been allowed to settle after a qualifying period, provided that the primary purpose of the marriage was not to obtain settlement in that country. These new measures were not extended to the wives and fiancées of settled men, a fact attributed by the Government to long-standing commitments (based allegedly on humanitarian, social and ethical reasons) to the reunification of the families of male immigrants. Nor did the new measures apply to nationals of other member States of the European Economic Community."

The Cabales marriage contract recited that the ceremony the couple went through in 1980 had been performed, without a licence, under Article 76.

However, this does not mean that all intended family life falls entirely outside its ambit.

Neither was it established that race relations or immigration controls were enhanced by the rules: they might create resentment in part of the immigrant population and it had not been shown that it was more difficult to limit abuses by non-national husbands than by other immigrant groups. The Commission unanimously concluded that there had been discrimination on the ground of sex, contrary to Article 14 (art. 14), in securing the applicants'right to respect for family life, the application of the relevant rules being disproportionate to the purported aims.",

Neither does the Court perceive any conclusive evidence to contradict it in the Parliamentary debates, on which the applicants also relied.

In this connection, other factors must also be taken into account. Being \"economically active\" does not always mean that one is seeking to be employed by someone else. Moreover, although a greater number of men than of women may be inclined to seek employment, immigrant husbands were already by far outnumbered, before the introduction of the 1980 Rules, by immigrant wives (see paragraph 38 (e) above), many of whom were also \"economically active\".

However, if the applicant did not wait in the queue for his turn and left of his own will, then the failure to produce documents could not be held against him. Alternatively, if the police asked for his documents, that suggests, by converse implication, that it was his turn in the queue or else that he was granted priority treatment.

This rule therefore could not avail by analogy a husband in a family known by the wife ’ s surname.

It is expressly forbidden to suspend the effects of any such laws which might prove to be incompatible with the Constitution. This prohibition seems to have been extended by current case-law to cases in which there is a conflict between such a law and a treaty. That being so, the applicants cannot be blamed for having founded their appeal solely on domestic law - Articles 30 and 160 of the Civil Code, 8a of the final section of that code and 4 para. 2 of the Constitution - seeing that their arguments were identical in substance with those they submitted to the Commission.

Secondly, award of the pension depended exclusively on the degree of incapacity, no account being taken either of the insured ’ s income or wealth or of the payment of contributions.

                "46. The Court is here once again confronted with the issue of the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) to social-security disputes. The question arose earlier in the cases of Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands and Deumeland v. Germany, in which it gave judgment on 29 May 1986 (Series A nos. 99 and 100). At that time the Court noted that there was great diversity in the legislation and practice of the member States of the Council of Europe as regards the nature of the entitlement to insurance benefits under social-security schemes. Nevertheless, the development in the law that was initiated by those judgments and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance (see the Salesi v. Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-E, pp. 59-60, para. 19).",
                "As in the two cases decided in 1986, State intervention is not sufficient to establish that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is inapplicable; other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in the instant case. The most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public-law features pointed out by the Government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence; she was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a federal statute (see paragraph 35 above).",

They emphasised a number of aspects. Firstly, the traditional characteristics of social-security disputes made oral presentation of arguments in which technical points and numerous figures were adduced difficult. Secondly, in the cases brought before it the Federal Insurance Court was free to review the facts and the law, and this made it more akin to an ordinary court of appeal. This was particularly so in administrative-law appeals, as here the Federal Court could rule on the appropriateness of the impugned decision and was not bound either by the cantonal authority ’ s findings of fact or by the submissions of the parties. Thirdly, the number of judgments - approximately 1,200 a year - would drop dramatically if public, oral proceedings were to be the rule; in such an event, the lengthening of the proceedings would seriously jeopardise access to the supreme court."

The survey revealed that psychological violence, followed by physical violence, is the most widely reported form of abuse in the family. Almost a third of the women interviewed indicated having been subjected to multiple forms of violence. The study notes that domestic violence runs across lines of class and education; however, women with a higher level of education or economic status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence. Sexual violence remains the least reported form of violence. This may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts.",

The Government submitted that A. had returned to the family home in December 2010 and stayed until 16 January 2011 because the first applicant had allowed him to do so. While the Government did not wish to suggest that the first applicant was responsible for the assault on her that had taken place on 13 January 2011, the fact that she had allowed him to stay in the house made the recurrence of violence possible and meant that the authorities were unable to protect her from harm."

However, following A.’s admission of guilt and sincere apologies for his behaviour, the prosecutor had decided to suspend the investigation on condition that A. committed no further offences for one year. Such a suspension had not resulted in impunity for A., but rather it was seen as being the best way of protecting the applicants against the recurrence of A.’s acts of domestic violence, given the potential punishment he now faced (see paragraph 28 above). In this connection, the extension of the protection order on 14 March 2011 (see paragraph 19 above) had not been prompted by any new incident, but by A.’s visit to the family home to wish his daughter a happy birthday, which the Government alleged had only taken place with the first applicant’s permission."

The authorities never considered the impact of such a failure to enforce a court order by a police officer on the public order and never initiated criminal proceedings under Article 320 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 29 above).

Discrimination is treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in relevantly similar situations (see Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, § 48, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV ). Racial violence is a particular affront to human dignity and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment.

                "“ ... States have a general obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation in cases of deprivation of life.",
                "That obligation must be discharged without discrimination, as required by Article 14 of the Convention ... [W] here there is suspicion that racial attitudes induced a violent act it is particularly important that the official investigation is pursued with vigour and impartiality, having regard to the need to reassert continuously society's condemnation of racism and ethnic hatred and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence. Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",
                "... [W] hen investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV). In order to maintain public confidence in their law enforcement machinery, Contracting States must ensure that in the investigation of incidents involving the use of force a distinction is made both in their legal systems and in practice between cases of excessive use of force and of racist killing.",
                "Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute (see, mutatis mutandis, Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, § 90, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, setting out the same standard with regard to the general obligation to investigate). The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of a racially induced violence .”"

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties'submissions.

Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",

No attempt was made to verify Major G.'s record and to ascertain, for example, whether he had previously been involved in similar incidents or whether he had ever been accused in the past of displaying anti-Roma sentiment.

The Court reiterates that sexual orientation is a profound part of a person ’ s identity and that gender and sexual orientation are two distinctive and intimate characteristics. It notes, in this regard, cases which have been brought before the Court concerning gender identity revealing the intimate importance that one gives to it (see, among many other authorities, Grant v. the United Kingdom, no. 32570/03, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; L. v.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State ’ s positive and negative obligations under this provision does not lend itself to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Von Hannover v.

Thus, the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures cannot in any way, even in the case of persons exercising official functions, authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions, or legitimize intrusions into private life (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2), cited above, § 97, and more recently, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 122, 10 November 2015 )."

Germany, cited above, § 58). Thus, in such cases the Court will need to balance the applicant ’ s right to “respect for his private life” against the public interest in protecting freedom of expression, bearing in mind that no hierarchical relationship exists between the rights guaranteed by the two Articles (see Timciuc v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society (see, amongst many authorities, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Reinboth and Others v. Finland, no. 30865/08, § 74, 25 January 2011). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2 which must, however, be strictly construed.

In the case of Welsh and Silva Canha, it took into account the content of the article written by the journalists – the misuse of public money  in a satirist newspaper. In this regard, the instant case is distinguishable from previous cases where the right to respect for private life had to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression, as the joke was not made in the context of a debate of public interest and, as such, no matters of public interest were at stake (see, for example, Axel Springer AG v.

In so far as the relationship with the other parent remains intact subsequently (that is, after the adoption), the court declares it to have been severed in respect of the parent concerned, subject to his or her consent.",

I § 182, point 3). Only in this scenario does the law allow the courts to declare the latter relationship – which is unaffected by the adoption per se – to have been severed.",

It should be noted, however, that the European Court has also consistently ruled that the Council of Europe member States are to be allowed a margin of appreciation in this regard, which is correspondingly broader the less common ground there is amongst member States’ legal orders. In paragraph 41 of its judgment in Fretté v. France (no. 36515/97, ECHR 2002-I), the European Court expressly stated that, in the sphere of the right of homosexuals to adopt, member States had to be afforded a wide margin of appreciation as the issues concerned were subject to societal change and in a state of transition; however, this margin of appreciation was not to be interpreted as giving States carte blanche to exercise arbitrary power.",

Only a few European States allowed second-parent adoption in same-sex couples; the majority of States reserved second-parent adoption to married couples, and there was a consensus that unmarried different-sex couples and same-sex couples should not be treated differently. The difference complained of did not serve a legitimate aim: in particular, it was not necessary in order to protect the child’s interests. There was research to show that children developed just as well in families with homosexual parents as in families with heterosexual parents. What was important was not the parents’ sexual orientation but their ability to provide a stable and caring family. The applicants requested the appellate court to quash the District Court’s decision and to grant their request of 26 September 2005 or, alternatively, to refer the case back to the District Court for a fresh decision."

In its decision it described a number of related sets of proceedings (concerning visiting rights for the second applicant’s father as well as his maintenance obligations, and the proceedings in which the first and third applicants had tried unsuccessfully to obtain joint custody of the second applicant). The Regional Court observed that it had doubts as to whether the third applicant could represent her son in the proceedings, as there was a potential conflict of interests. It went on to state as follows:",
                "“Further examination of this issue is, however, objectively unnecessary, as, in the view of this court – as set out below – approval of the adoption agreement should in any event be refused in this case without the need for further investigation, and was indeed refused by the first-instance court, with the result that the effective representation of the child in the proceedings is not at issue.",
                "As far back as the decision on the application for a partial transfer of custody of [the child] to [the mother’s partner], the courts reviewing the case observed that, while Austrian family law contained no legal definition of the term ‘parents’, it was nevertheless abundantly clear from the provisions of Austrian family law as a whole that the legislature intended that a parental couple should consist, as a matter of principle, of two persons of opposite sex. The legislation therefore provided first and foremost for the biological parents to have custody, or the biological mother in the case of a child born outside marriage. Only where this was not possible did the law provide for other persons to be awarded custody of a child. If the biological parents (father and mother) were present, it was unnecessary to award custody to another person, even if, from a purely factual viewpoint, that person had a close relationship with the child (compare OGH, 7 Ob 144/02 f). The courts stressed that no discrimination against persons in same-sex partnerships could be inferred from this legal stance, but that the provisions of family law were based, in line with the biological reality, on the presence of a couple made up of parents of opposite gender.",
                "In this court’s view, these considerations also apply to the issue under examination here, namely the approval of the adoption of a minor child by the same-sex partner of one of the child’s parents. Here also, it is unnecessary to create an additional ‘legal parent’ where both the child’s opposite-sex parents are present. The aim is in no sense to discriminate against the same-sex partnership of the child’s mother; however, where both the opposite-sex parents are present, there is simply no need for a provision enabling one of the parents to be replaced by the same-sex partner of the other.",
                "The adoption of a minor child is fundamentally designed to create a relationship akin to that which exists between biological parents and their children. The file in the present case shows that the biological father has regular contact with his child, with the result that the child maintains a meaningful relationship with both his opposite-sex parents. In these circumstances, however, there is no need to replace either of the biological parents with the same-sex partner of the other parent by authorising the child’s adoption.",
                "The case-law concerning contact rights for parents also generally and indisputably recognises that, according to the available psychological and sociological findings, it is of particular importance for the child’s subsequent development that adequate personal contact be maintained with the parent with whom he or she is not living (see, inter alia, EFSlg 100.205). Accordingly, the legislation goes so far as to confer a right on the child to have personal contact with the parent not living in the same household (see, inter alia, OGH, 3 Ob 254/03 z). It is likewise beyond dispute that, for a minor child to thrive, it is highly desirable that he or she should have a personal relationship with both – opposite-sex – parents, in other words, with both a female (mother) and a male (father) caregiver, and that efforts should be made to that end (compare, inter alia, EFSlg 89.668). At least a minimum degree of personal contact between the child and both parents is therefore greatly to be desired and is generally made a requirement in the interests of the child’s healthy development (compare OGH, 7 Ob 234/99 h). These considerations also clearly militate against authorising the adoption of a child by the same-sex partner of one of the parents if that has the effect of severing the family-law relationship with the other parent.",
                "As stated above, this legal position in no sense amounts to discrimination against people in same-sex partnerships. On this point the first-instance court, in the reasoning of the impugned decision, correctly pointed to the settled case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, according to which sexual orientation falls within the scope of protection of private and family life (Article 8 of the Convention), with the result that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is fundamentally incompatible with Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court also correctly pointed out that national legal systems must be afforded a margin of appreciation in enacting legislation, a margin which is correspondingly broader where there is no clear consensus between member States’ legal systems in the sphere in question. While noting that the margin of appreciation must not be interpreted as giving States carte blanche to make arbitrary decisions, the first-instance court observed that it must be construed very generously in the sphere of the right of homosexuals to adopt, as these were issues which were subject to societal change. In the context of this assessment, the Austrian legal system made no provision for the adoption of a child by the same-sex partner of one of the parents.",
                "The appellants have adduced no convincing arguments to indicate that the provisions in force amount to discrimination against same-sex partners. Even in the case of heterosexual couples, the only legal relationship that may be severed when a partner’s child is adopted is the relationship between the child and the parent of the same sex as the adoptive parent. In such cases the child therefore continues to have two opposite-sex parents and caregivers. This state of affairs, which is important for the child’s development, does not however apply in the event of his or her adoption by the same-sex partner of one of the parents; there is therefore no evidence of an unjustified difference in treatment in this regard. Furthermore, in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights cited by the appellants (see Karner v. Austria, [cited above]), the Court reiterated that a difference in treatment of people living in a same-sex relationship was to be considered discriminatory only if it had no objective and reasonable justification, that is if it did not pursue a legitimate aim, or if there was not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Court would thus regard a difference in treatment as compatible with the Convention only where very weighty reasons had been put forward. Particularly compelling reasons therefore had to be advanced to justify any difference in treatment based on sexual orientation. However, the Court also explicitly acknowledged in this regard that protection of the ‘traditional family’ was, in principle, a weighty and legitimate reason which might justify a difference in treatment by the national legislature. At the same time, it found that the aim of protecting the family in the traditional sense was rather abstract and that a broad variety of concrete measures could be used to implement it. Compelling reasons had to be given for excluding people living in homosexual relationships from the scope of application of certain legal provisions. In the case in question, which concerned the right of a deceased person’s same-sex partner to succeed to a tenancy, the Court found that no such reasons had been given.",
                "Nevertheless, the judgment in question does not lend any support to the appellants’ arguments in the present case. On the basis of the right – recognised by the Court – to include measures in the national legal system to protect the ‘traditional family’, the stance taken in the Austrian legal system whereby, as a matter of principle and in accordance with biological reality, a minor child should have an opposite-sex couple as parents, has to be respected. Hence, in the view of this court, the decision by the legislature not to provide for a child to be adopted by the same-sex partner of one of the parents, with the result that the relationship with the opposite-sex parent is severed, unquestionably pursues a ‘legitimate aim’. Likewise, it cannot be said that ‘no reasonable relationship of proportionality’ exists between this aim and the means employed. This legal situation is not based – contrary to the appellants’ assertions – on ‘the prejudice of the heterosexual majority towards the homosexual minority’, but is merely designed to ensure that minor children have regular contact with both a female and a male parent while they are growing up. This aim must be respected in just the same way as the decision of the child’s mother to live in a same-sex partnership. Thus, there is no apparent justification for depriving the child of his family-law relationship with his parent of the other sex. However, that is precisely what the child’s mother and her partner sought in the present case and have continued to seek since the lodging of the appeal.",
                "Accordingly, in view of these overall considerations, the present appeal should be dismissed.",
                "The ruling on the admissibility of an appeal on points of law is based on sections 59(1)(2) and 62(1) of the Non-contentious Proceedings Act. While it is true that the Supreme Court already issued one decision in the instant case, that decision concerned the lawfulness of the (partial) transfer of custody of the child to the mother’s same-sex partner. As regards the issue now to be determined, however, namely whether the adoption of a child by the same-sex partner of one of the parents is lawful, no specific and express Supreme Court rulings exist on the subject to date, to the best of this court’s knowledge. For that reason the present decision is of considerable importance in terms of the unity of the law, legal certainty and development of the law.”"

                "19. The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court. They submitted that Article 182 § 2 of the Civil Code as applied by the courts led to a difference in treatment between different-sex and same-sex couples in cases where one partner wished to adopt the other partner’s biological child. While heterosexual couples (including unmarried ones) could establish an additional parent-child relationship between the child and its parent’s partner, this was impossible for same-sex couples, as the same-sex partner would replace the biological parent. Thus, any meaningful kind of second-parent adoption was excluded. The Regional Court had sought to justify this difference in treatment by referring to the aims of protecting the family in the traditional sense and allowing the child to grow up with both a male and a female caregiver. However, the Regional Court had not shown that the exclusion of same-sex families from second-parent adoption was necessary to achieve that aim. Recent studies showed that same-sex couples were just as capable of raising children as different-sex couples. Moreover, the present case did not concern the question whether the second applicant should or should not grow up in a same-sex family. He was already part of a de facto same-sex family. The question therefore was whether it was justified to deny legal recognition to the relationship between him and the first applicant. It had not been shown to be necessary to distinguish between unmarried heterosexual and same-sex couples. Finally, the applicants maintained that in many European States second-parent adoption was reserved to married couples. They asserted that where a State chose, as Austria had, to allow second-parent adoption in unmarried couples, it was not free to make a distinction on the basis of sexual orientation."

However, the agreement provided for the first applicant to take the place not of the child’s mother but of his biological father. The applicants sought court approval of the adoption such that the relationship with the biological father and his relatives under family law would cease to exist while the relationship with the child’s biological mother would remain fully intact. They requested the courts to override the refusal of consent by the child’s father.",
                "The first-instance court refused the application, taking the view that Article 182 of the Civil Code reflected the legislature’s clear intention that, in the case of adoption by one person, the legal relationship with the parent of the same sex as the adoptive parent should cease to exist and the relationship with the opposite-sex parent should be preserved. Only in this scenario, according to the first-instance court, did the law allow the courts to also declare the latter relationship, which was not affected by the adoption per se, to have been severed. In the view of the first-instance court, the arrangement sought by the applicants, whereby [the child] would be adopted by a woman and the legal relationship with his biological father but not with his biological mother would cease, was incompatible with the law. This interpretation was in conformity with the Constitution and in particular with Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, member States had a particularly wide margin of appreciation in the sphere of adoption by homosexuals, as these issues were subject to societal change and were in a state of transition. The question whether a member State provided the possibility for two persons of the same sex to create a legal relationship with a child on an equal footing was therefore a matter for the State itself to decide, subject to the limits laid down in Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. The arrangement sought by the applicants was not possible under Austrian law.",
                "The appellate court upheld the decision of the first-instance court, taking the view that the law was clearly based on the premise that the term ‘parents’ necessarily referred to two persons of opposite sex. This was reflected in the law on custody, which as a matter of principle gave priority to the biological parents over other persons. The same considerations applied in the sphere of adoption law. Here too the legislative provisions were based, in line with the biological reality, on the presence of a couple made up of parents of opposite gender. Where both the opposite-sex parents were present, there was no need for a provision enabling one of the parents to be replaced by the same-sex partner of the other; this did not reflect any wish to discriminate against same-sex partners. In the sphere of contact rights it was also recognised beyond dispute that, for a minor child to thrive, it was highly desirable that he or she should have a personal relationship with both – opposite-sex – parents, in other words with both a female (mother) and a male (father) caregiver. At least a minimum degree of personal contact between the child and both (biological) parents was to be desired and was generally made a requirement in the interests of the child’s healthy development. These considerations too could be applied in relation to adoption. The appellate court also endorsed the first-instance court’s view that there was no discrimination against same-sex partners from the standpoint of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. A difference in the treatment of persons living in a same-sex relationship was to be regarded as discriminatory only if it had no objective and reasonable justification, in other words, if the rule in question did not pursue a legitimate aim or if there was no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Differences in treatment were found to be compatible with the Convention where weighty reasons had been put forward. The Austrian legislature pursued one such legitimate aim in seeking to ensure that children, as they were growing up, had the regular contact with both a male and a female parent which their development required. That aim was to be accorded the same respect as the mother’s decision to live in a same-sex partnership. There was no justification, however, for depriving a child of the relationship under family law with his or her parent of the other sex.",

It is quite clear from the materials (ErlBem RV 107 BlgNR IX. GP, 21) that this provision should be construed to mean that the non-proprietary legal ties are severed only with the biological parent who is being replaced by an adoptive parent of the same gender. In explicit terms, this means that the child cannot, for instance, be deprived of his or her biological father if he or she is being adopted just by a woman (see also: Schwimann in Schwimann, op. cit., § 182, sub-paragraph 3; Stabentheiner in Rummel I § 182, sub-paragraph 2).",
                "Contrary to the applicants’ assertion, this provision is not to be construed extensively in the way that they argue, nor does there exist an unintended legislative gap which therefore needs to be filled by analogy. According to the materials (op. cit., 11), the chief aim of adoption is to promote the well-being of the minor child (the protective principle). Adoption should constitute an appropriate means of entrusting to suitable and responsible individuals the care and upbringing of children who have no parents, those who come from broken homes or those whose parents, for whatever reason, are unable to provide their children with a proper upbringing or may not even want their children. However, this aim can be achieved only when the adoption allows the situation in a biological family to be recreated as far as possible.",
                "The case-law (6 Ob 179/05z) also makes clear that the tie between the child and the adoptive parent is to be understood as a social and psychological relationship, akin to that between biological parents and their children. The model for the child-parent relationship in the context of adoption of minors is informed by the specific social and psychological ties that exist between parents and young people approaching adulthood. In addition to the socially typical ties of physical and personal proximity (shared household, care for the child’s physical and psychological needs by its parents), these encompass emotional ties comparable to the love between parents and their children, and a specific role for the parents as mentors and role models.",
                "Article 182 § 2 of the Civil Code imposes a general prohibition (that is, not just in the case of same-sex partners) on adoption by a man as long as the ties of kinship with the child’s biological father still exist, and by a woman where such ties still exist with the biological mother. Under Article 182 § 2, therefore, a person who adopts a child on his or her own does not take the place of either parent at will, but only the place of the parent of the same sex. The adoption of the child by the female partner of the biological mother is therefore not legally possible.",
                "Contrary to the applicants’ view, this provision also survives the test of compatibility with the Constitution (fundamental rights perspective). In the case of Fretté [cited above], the European Court of Human Rights was called upon to examine whether the authorities’ refusal to authorise the adoption of a child by a homosexual man amounted to discrimination. In its judgment of 26 February 2002, the Court found that adoption meant ‘providing a child with a family, not a family with a child’. According to the Court, it was the State’s task to ensure that the persons chosen to adopt were those who could offer the child the most suitable home in every respect. Not least in view of the wide differences in national and international opinion concerning the possible consequences of a child being adopted by one or more homosexual parents, and bearing in mind the fact that there were not enough children to adopt to satisfy demand, States had to be allowed a broad margin of appreciation in this sphere. A refusal to authorise adoption by a homosexual would not be in breach of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 8 if it pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the child’s best interests, and did not infringe the principle of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.",
                "The applicants have not demonstrated, nor is there any other evidence to suggest, that the provisions of Article 182 § 2 of the Austrian Civil Code overstep the margin of appreciation accorded by the European Court, or that they infringe the proportionality principle. The Supreme Court is therefore in no doubt as to the compatibility of this provision with the Constitution, which is called into question by the applicants.",
                "In view of the legal impossibility of the adoption it is also not necessary to further examine whether the conditions for overriding the father’s refusal to consent, as an exceptional measure under Article 181 § 3 of the Civil Code, have been met.”",
                "The judgment was served on the applicants’ counsel on 24 October 2006.",

                "“LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] persons can adopt a child by one of three procedures. A single lesbian woman or gay man may apply to become an adoptive parent (single-parent adoption). Alternatively, a same-sex couple can adopt their partner’s biological or adopted children without terminating the first parent’s legal rights. These are so called ‘second-parent adoptions’ and give the child two legal guardians. Second-parent adoptions also protect the parents by giving both of them legally recognised parental status. The lack of second-parent adoption deprives the child and the non-biological parent of rights if the biological parent dies or in the case of divorce, separation, or other circumstances that would bar the parent from carrying out parental responsibilities. The child also has no right to inherit from the non-biological parent. Moreover, at an everyday level, the lack of second-parent adoption rules out parental leave, which can be harmful financially for LGBT families. The third procedure is joint adoption of a child by a same sex couple.",

Apart from Finland and Germany these member states also give access to joint adoptions for same-sex couples. In Austria and France there is no access to second-parent adoption but same-sex couples in registered partnerships are allowed some parental authority or responsibilities. No access to joint adoption or second-parent adoption is a reality in 35 member states: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, ‘the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’, Turkey and Ukraine. ...”",

Consequently, the legal impossibility for a homosexual to adopt his or her partner’s child, resulting from Article 182 § 2 of the Civil Code, had not come into play.

The applicants pointed out that this was a crucial difference compared with Gas and Dubois v. France (no. 25951/07, ECHR 2012), as under French law second-parent adoption was reserved to married couples. The present case therefore raised an issue similar to that in Karner v. Austria (no. 40016/98, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX), in that a right which was open to unmarried heterosexual couples was refused to same-sex couples. Furthermore they pointed out that only four Council of Europe member States adopted the same position as Austria, that is to say, allowing second-parent adoption in unmarried opposite-sex couples while prohibiting it in same-sex couples.

Before the domestic courts, they had argued that the refusal by the second applicant’s father to consent to the adoption was not justified as he had been acting against the interests of the child. Consequently, the second applicant’s interest in the adoption outweighed his father’s interest in objecting to it. Thus, they argued that the court should have overridden the father’s refusal in accordance with Article 181 § 3 of the Civil Code. In the case of an opposite-sex couple, the District Court would have carried out a detailed examination and would have had to deliver a separate decision on this issue. However, in the applicants’ case it had denied them any inquiry of the facts on the ground that the adoption requested by them was in any case not possible under Austrian law.

According to the Court’s case-law, it was for the Government to show that the exclusion of same-sex couples from second-parent adoption was necessary to achieve that aim. There was a far-reaching scientific consensus that same-sex couples were as capable as different-sex couples of ensuring the positive development of children. From among the studies they submitted, the applicants referred at the hearing to a large-scale study entitled “The life of children in same-sex civil partnerships” commissioned by the German Ministry of Justice (Marina Rupp (ed.), Die Lebenssituation von Kindern in gleich ­ geschlechtlichen Lebenspartnerschaften, Cologne, 2009)."

Furthermore, they submitted that under Austrian law an adopted child often had two mothers or two fathers. Under Article 182 § 2 of the Civil Code, the adoption severed the family-law relationship between the adopted child and the biological parent or parents.

In all these texts the key notion in respect of adoption was the best interests of the child and not the gender or the sexual orientation of the parents.

Austrian adoption law gave priority to the biological parents when it came to the care of their child. Since adoption resulted in the loss of parental rights, it was only to be authorised if it was clearly in the child’s interests. The consent of the replaced parent, whose relationship with the child was also protected by Article 8, was therefore a prerequisite for adoption. Austrian law struck a reasonable balance between all the interests involved."

On the facts of the case, the Government argued that it did not raise a discrimination issue as there had been no difference in treatment between the first and third applicants’ case and the case of an unmarried different-sex couple. They asserted that the domestic courts, in particular the Regional Court, had thoroughly assessed the question of the second applicant’s interest in the adoption and had come to the conclusion that he had a relationship with his father and that there was thus no need to replace the latter by an adoptive parent. The Government stressed in particular that the consent of both biological parents was an essential precondition for any adoption. As the second applicant’s father did not consent in the present case, the courts would have been similarly prevented from agreeing to the adoption if the request had been made by the unmarried different-sex partner of the third applicant. The Government further argued that the applicants had not substantiated their allegations that there were grounds for overriding the father’s refusal to consent to the adoption, nor had they requested a formal decision on that point."

The impossibility for a woman to adopt another woman’s child would also apply if an aunt wished to adopt her nephew while his relationship with his mother was still intact. The explicit exclusion of second-parent adoption in same-sex couples had only been introduced by the Registered Partnership Act in 2010.

Should the Court consider that there had been a difference in treatment and enter into the question of justification for the prohibition of second-parent adoption in same-sex couples, the Government argued that recreating the biological family and securing the child’s well-being were legitimate aims. Austrian adoption law did not aim to exclude same-sex couples but sought, as a general rule, to avoid a situation where a child had two mothers or two fathers for legal purposes. The law pursued these aims using appropriate means, as it also had to take the interests of other persons involved into account, and secured the interests of the partner of the child’s parent by other means."

The Court, examining the case under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, noted that French law authorised any unmarried person, man or woman, to apply to adopt, and that the French authorities had refused the applicant’s request for prior authorisation on the ground – albeit implicit ­ – of his sexual orientation. Thus there had been a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation (see Fretté, cited above, § 32). The Court found that the domestic authorities’ decisions had pursued a legitimate aim, namely to protect the health and rights of children who could be involved in an adoption procedure. With regard to whether a difference in treatment was justified, the Court noted in particular that there was little common ground between member States of the Council of Europe, where the law appeared to be going through a transitional phase, and that national authorities should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when ruling on such matters. In respect of the competing interests of the applicant and children eligible for adoption, the Court noted that the scientific community was divided over the possible consequences of children being brought up by one or more homosexual parents, regard being had in particular to the limited number of scientific studies on the subject published at the material time. In conclusion, the Court considered that the refusal to authorise the adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and that, accordingly, the difference in treatment complained of was not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 37-43)."

It analysed in detail the reasons given by the French authorities for refusing the applicant, who was living with another woman in a stable same-sex relationship, authorisation to adopt. The Court noted that the domestic authorities had based their decisions on two main grounds, the lack of a “paternal referent” in the applicant’s household or immediate circle of family and friends, and the lack of commitment on the part of her partner. It added that the two grounds formed part of an overall assessment of the applicant’s situation, with the result that the illegitimacy of one ground contaminated the entire decision. While the second ground was not unreasonable, the first ground was implicitly linked to the applicant’s homosexuality and the authorities’ reference to it was excessive in the context of a single person’s request for authorisation to adopt. In sum, the applicant’s sexual orientation had been consistently at the centre of deliberations in her regard and had been decisive for the decision to refuse her authorisation to adopt (see E.B. v. France, cited above, §§ 72-89). The Court went on to say that if the reasons advanced for a difference in treatment were based solely on considerations regarding the applicant’s sexual orientation, this would amount to discrimination under the Convention (ibid., § 93). It observed that, under French law, a single person was allowed to adopt and that it was undisputed that this opened up the possibility of adoption by a single homosexual. Having regard to its analysis of the reasons advanced by the French authorities, it concluded that in refusing the applicant authorisation to adopt, they had made a distinction on the basis of her sexual orientation which was not acceptable under the Convention.

The case of Gas and Dubois (cited above) concerned two women forming a same-sex couple who had concluded a civil partnership ( pacte civil de solidarité – PACS) under French law. One of them was the mother of a child conceived by means of assisted reproduction. Under French law she was the sole parent of the child. The applicants complained under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 that one partner could not adopt the other’s child. More specifically, they wished to obtain a simple adoption order ( adoption simple ) under French law in order to create a parent-child relationship between the child and her mother’s partner with the possibility of sharing parental responsibility. The domestic courts had refused the adoption request on the ground that it would transfer parental rights from the child’s mother to her partner, which was not in the child’s interests (see Gas and Dubois, cited above, § 62). The Court examined the applicants’ situation in comparison with that of a married couple. It noted that, in cases of adoption simple, French law allowed only married couples to share parental rights. As Contracting States were not obliged to grant access to marriage to same-sex couples, and having regard to the special status conferred by marriage, the applicants’ legal situation was not comparable to that of a married couple (ibid., § 68). As to the situation of unmarried different-sex couples living together – like the applicants – in a civil partnership, the Court noted that second-parent adoption was not open to them either (ibid., § 69).

It reiterates in the first place that Article 12 of the Convention does not impose an obligation on the Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to marriage (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, §§ 54-64). Nor can a right to same-sex marriage be derived from Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (ibid., § 101). Where a State chooses to provide same-sex couples with an alternative means of legal recognition, it enjoys a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred (ibid., § 108; see also Gas and Dubois, cited above, § 66). Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly held that marriage confers a special status on those who enter into it. The exercise of the right to marry is protected by Article 12 of the Convention and gives rise to social, personal and legal consequences (see, among other authorities, Gas and Dubois, cited above, § 68, and Burden, cited above, § 63)."

In contrast, second-parent adoption in a same-sex couple is legally impossible. This follows from Article 182 § 2 of the Civil Code, according to which any person who adopts effectively replaces the biological parent of the same sex. In the present case, as the first applicant is a woman, the second applicant’s adoption by her could only sever the relationship with his mother, who is her same-sex partner. Adoption can therefore not serve to create a parent-child relationship between the first and second applicants in addition to the relationship with his mother, the third applicant.

Secondly, any adoption required the consent of the child’s biological parents. As the second applicant’s father did not consent, the courts had been obliged to refuse the adoption request. They would have had to decide in exactly the same way had the first applicant been the male partner of the third applicant.

Although the present case may be seen against the background of the wider debate on same-sex couples’ parental rights, the Court is not called upon to rule on the issue of second-parent adoption by same-sex couples as such, let alone on the question of adoption by same-sex couples in general. What it has to decide is a narrowly defined issue of alleged discrimination between unmarried different-sex couples and same-sex couples in respect of second-parent adoption."

It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. While Article 8 does not guarantee a right to adopt, the Court has already held, in respect of adoption by a single homosexual, that a State which creates a right going beyond its obligations under Article 8 of the Convention may not apply that right in a manner which is discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 (see E.B. v.

As the Regional Court observed in its judgment of 21 February 2006, the provisions in issue aimed to protect the “traditional family”. Austrian law was based on the principle that, in accordance with biological reality, a minor child should have two persons of opposite sex as parents. Thus the decision not to provide for a child to be adopted by the same-sex partner of one of the parents, with the result of severing the relationship with the opposite-sex parent, served a legitimate aim. Similarly, the Supreme Court, in its judgment of 27 September 2006, noted that the primary aim of adoption was to provide children who had no parents or whose parents were not able to care for them with responsible caregivers. That aim could only be achieved by recreating the situation of a biological family as far as possible. In short, the domestic courts and the Government relied on the protection of the traditional family, based on the tacit assumption that only a family with parents of different sex could adequately provide for a child’s needs."

It goes without saying that the protection of the interests of the child is also a legitimate aim. It remains to be ascertained whether, in the circumstances of the case, the principle of proportionality was adhered to."

The aim of protecting the family in the traditional sense is rather abstract and a broad variety of concrete measures may be used to implement it (see Karner, § 41, and Kozak, § 98, both cited above). Also, given that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in present-day conditions, the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family and secure respect for family life as required by Article 8, must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil-status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice when it comes to leading one’s family or private life (see Kozak, cited above, § 98)."

It must also be shown that it was necessary, in order to achieve that aim, to exclude certain categories of people, in this instance persons living in a homosexual relationship, from the scope of application of the provisions in issue (see Karner, § 41, and Kozak, § 99, both cited above)."

The Government did not adduce any specific argument, any scientific studies or any other item of evidence to show that a family with two parents of the same sex could in no circumstances adequately provide for a child’s needs. On the contrary, they conceded that, in personal terms, same-sex couples could be as suitable or unsuitable as different-sex couples when it came to adopting children. Furthermore, the Government stated that the Civil Code was not aimed at excluding same-sex partners from second-parent adoption. Nonetheless, they stressed that the legislature had wished to avoid a situation in which a child had two mothers or two fathers for legal purposes. The explicit exclusion of second-parent adoption in same-sex couples had only been introduced by the Registered Partnership Act in 2010, which had not been in force when the present case was determined by the domestic courts and was therefore not relevant in the present case."

Regarding the Registered Partnership Act, the Court agrees that it is not directly in issue in the present case. It may nevertheless be of relevance in so far as it may shed light on the reasons underlying the prohibition of second-parent adoption in same-sex couples. However, the explanatory report on the draft law (see paragraph 42 above) only states that section 8(4) of the Act was included as a result of repeated requests made during the consultation procedure. In other words, it merely reflects the position of those sectors of society which are opposed to the idea of opening up second-parent adoption to same-sex couples."

If he or she has a registered partner, the latter has to consent, in accordance with the amendment to Article 181 § 1, sub-paragraph 2, of the Civil Code, which was introduced together with the Registered Partnership Act (see paragraph 40 above). The legislature therefore accepts that a child may grow up in a family based on a same-sex couple, thus accepting that this is not detrimental to the child. Nevertheless, Austrian law insists that a child should not have two mothers or two fathers (see, mutatis mutandis, Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 78, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI, where the Court also took into consideration the lack of coherence of the domestic legal system)."

The Court observes that in contrast to individual adoption or joint adoption, which are usually aimed at creating a relationship with a child previously unrelated to the adopter, second-parent adoption serves to confer rights vis-à-vis the child on the partner of one of the child’s parents. The Court itself has often stressed the importance of granting legal recognition to de facto family life (see Wagner and J.M.W.L. v. Luxembourg, no. 76240/01, § 119, 28 June 2007; see also, in the context of second-parent adoption, Eski, cited above, § 39, and Emonet and Others, cited above, §§ 63-64)."

Unless any other particularly convincing and weighty reasons militate in favour of such an absolute prohibition, the considerations adduced so far would seem rather to weigh in favour of allowing the courts to carry out an examination of each individual case. This would also appear to be more in keeping with the best interests of the child, which is a key notion in the relevant international instruments (see, in particular, paragraph 49 above, and E.B. v. France, cited above, § 95)."

Relying on Article 8 of the Convention, they asserted that the margin of appreciation was a wide one in the sphere of adoption law, which had to strike a careful balance between the interests of all the persons involved. In the present context it was even wider, as there was no European consensus on the issue of second-parent adoption by same-sex couples."

Where a particularly important facet of an individual’s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will normally be restricted. Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see, as recent examples, S.H. and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 94, and A, B and C v. Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, § 232, ECHR 2010). However, the Court reaffirms that when it comes to issues of discrimination on the grounds of sex or sexual orientation to be examined under Article 14, the State’s margin of appreciation is narrow (see paragraph 99 above)."

Furthermore, and solely in order to respond to the Government’s assertion that no European consensus exists, it has to be borne in mind that the issue before the Court is not the general question of same-sex couples’ access to second-parent adoption, but the difference in treatment between unmarried different-sex couples and same-sex couples in respect of this type of adoption (see paragraph 134 above). Consequently, only those ten Council of Europe member States which allow second-parent adoption in unmarried couples may be regarded as a basis for comparison. Within that group, six States treat heterosexual couples and same-sex couples in the same manner, while four adopt the same position as Austria (see the comparative-law information at paragraph 57 above). The Court considers that the narrowness of this sample is such that no conclusions can be drawn as to the existence of a possible consensus among Council of Europe member States."

Secondly, given the low number of ratifications so far, it may be open to doubt whether the Convention reflects common ground among European States at present. In any event, the Court notes that Article 7 § 1 of the 2008 Convention on the Adoption of Children provides that States are to permit adoption by two persons of different sex (who are married or, where that institution exists, are registered partners) or by one person. Under Article 7 § 2, States are free to extend the scope of the Convention to same-sex couples who are married or have entered into a registered partnership, as well as “to different-sex couples and same-sex couples who are living together in a stable relationship”. This indicates that Article 7 § 2 does not mean that States are free to treat heterosexual and same-sex couples who live in a stable relationship differently. The Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation of 31 March 2010 (CM/Rec (2010)5) appears to point in the same direction: paragraph 23 calls on member States to ensure that the rights and obligations conferred on unmarried couples apply in a non-discriminatory way to both same-sex and different-sex couples. In any event, even if the interpretation of Article 7 § 2 of the 2008 Convention were to lead to another result, the Court reiterates that States retain Convention liability in respect of treaty commitments subsequent to the entry into force of the Convention (see Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, no. 61498/08, § 128, ECHR 2010)."

However, having regard to the considerations set out above, the Court finds that the Government have failed to adduce particularly weighty and convincing reasons to show that excluding second-parent adoption in a same-sex couple, while allowing that possibility in an unmarried different-sex couple, was necessary for the protection of the family in the traditional sense or for the protection of the interests of the child.

It creates a legal parent-child relationship which takes the place of the original relationship (if such existed). The child takes on the adoptive parent’s surname. A new birth certificate is drawn up and the adoption is irrevocable (Articles 355 et seq. of the Civil Code)."

The order can be made irrespective of the age of the person being adopted, including when he or she has reached the age of majority. The adoptive parent’s surname is added to that of the adoptee. The latter retains some inheritance rights in his or her family of origin and acquires rights vis-à-vis the adoptive parent. Simple adoption gives rise to reciprocal obligations between adopter and adoptee, in particular a maintenance requirement. The biological parents are required to support the adopted person financially only if the adoptive parent is unable to do so.",

In principle, once parentage has been established, the parents of a minor child automatically have parental responsibility, which can only be withdrawn on serious grounds. Parental responsibility ends when the child reaches the age of majority, normally at 18. A distinction is made between parental responsibility and the exercise of parental responsibility; the latter may be entrusted to just one parent for reasons relating to the child’s best interests.

The order delegating parental responsibility may stipulate, “in the interests of the child’s upbringing”, that one or both parents are to share the exercise of their parental responsibility in whole or in part with the third party, thus retaining shared responsibility. This measure makes it possible to regulate the relationship between the child, the separated couple and the third parties, whether they be grandparents, step-parents or live-in partners.

Some effects deriving from marriage remain inapplicable to civil partnerships. Among other things, the legislation does not give rise to any kinship or inheritance ties between the partners.

Hence, whether in relation to everyday life (school enrolment and monitoring of the child’s progress in school) or more serious circumstances (a road traffic accident), A. could be accompanied only by her mother, whereas A.D. could be taken care of by Mr D. Moreover, in the event of the death of the child’s birth mother, A. would become an orphan and could be placed in the care of a guardian or a foster family, whereas custody of A.D. would be entrusted to her legal father. The applicants inferred from this that the French legislation concerning simple adoption and anonymous donor insemination prevented the creation of a legal adoptive relationship between A. and the first applicant, which would have been possible had the latter been a man. While the applicants stressed that they did not wish to call into question the provisions of French law concerning access to anonymous donor insemination, they maintained that there was a difference in treatment under the law depending on whether a couple raising children was made up of two women cohabiting or in a civil partnership or of a woman and a man in the same situation."

Furthermore, according to the applicants, the delegation of parental responsibility on a shared basis (which they had not requested before the domestic courts) would not suffice. This related only to parental responsibility, was temporary and, as from 8 July 2010, had not been readily granted by the national courts (see paragraph 29 above).

Next, the Government submitted that Article 365 of the Civil Code did not give rise to any objective discrimination, since it applied in identical fashion to all unmarried couples, regardless of the composition of the couple. The sole exception provided for by the Article in question, applicable to an individual’s spouse, had been introduced by the legislature with a view to safeguarding the child’s interests. In the Government’s submission, marriage remained an institution which ensured greater stability within couples than other types of union. Moreover, in the case of the break ‑ up of a marriage, the family judge automatically became involved. Civil partnerships, on the other hand, afforded greater leeway with regard to entering into them and terminating them, and did not have any implications in terms of family law or the legal relationship between parents and children. In view of these considerations, the legislature had therefore sought to restrict the possibility of obtaining a simple-adoption order, in order to provide a stable framework for children’s care and upbringing."

The latter concerned the handling of an application for authorisation to adopt made by a single homosexual person. In that case, the Court pointed out that French law allowed single persons to adopt a child, thereby opening up the possibility of adoption by a single homosexual. Against the background of the domestic legal provisions, it considered that the reasons put forward by the Government could not be regarded as particularly convincing and weighty such as to justify refusing to grant the applicant authorisation. The reasons for rejecting her application had therefore related to her personal situation and were found by the Court to be discriminatory (ibid., § 94)."

In giving reasons for their decision, the national courts found that, since a simple-adoption order would result in the rights associated with parental responsibility being transferred to the adoptive parent, it was not in the child’s best interests, given that the birth mother intended to continue raising the child. In so ruling, the courts applied the provisions of Article 365 of the Civil Code governing the exercise of parental responsibility in the event of simple adoption. As the applicants were not married, they were not covered by the sole exception provided for by that provision."

With regard to anonymous donor insemination as provided for in French law, the Court notes that the applicants, without wishing to call into question the conditions in which this is made available, criticised the legal consequences and alleged an unjustified difference in treatment (see paragraph 43 in fine above). The Court observes at the outset that the applicants did not challenge the legislation in question before the national courts. Above all, it notes that while French law provides that anonymous donor insemination is available only to heterosexual couples it also states that it is to be made available for therapeutic purposes only, with a view in particular to remedying clinically diagnosed infertility or preventing the transmission of a particularly serious disease (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Hence, broadly speaking, anonymous donor insemination in France is confined to infertile heterosexual couples, a situation which is not comparable to that of the applicants. In the Court’s view, therefore, the applicants cannot be said to be the victims of a difference in treatment arising out of the French legislation in this regard. The Court further notes that the legislation in question does not allow the creation of the legal adoptive relationship sought by the applicants."

Nor can a right to same-sex marriage be derived from Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (ibid., § 101).

In essence, the Court notes that any couple in a comparable legal situation by virtue of having entered into a civil partnership would likewise have their application for a simple-adoption order refused (see paragraphs 19, 24 and 31 above).

Switzerland, no. 39051/03, § 80, 13 December 2007). It considers that, in view of the background to and purpose of Article 365 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 19 above), which governs the exercise of parental responsibility in the event of simple adoption, there is no justification, on the sole basis of a challenge to the application of that provision, for authorising the creation of a dual legal parent-child relationship with A."

It considered that in adopting the criteria set out in section 4 ( 1 ) (a) of the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act of 12 June 1959 (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, paragraph 30 below ) Parliament ’ s intention had not been to generally exempt all people with disabilities from the obligation to pay the tax in question. In the applicant ’ s case the medical examination of 14 May 2002 had shown that his disability was not a major one and that his condition was highly unlikely to be an obstacle in his future career. Thanks to medical progress, patients with the applicant ’ s type of diabetes could live quite normal lives these days and practise almost any line of work. That being so, the people concerned were not considered to have disabilities for the purposes of section 4 ( 1 ) (a) of the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act. The Board further found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that his condition, and in particular the need to administer himself four insulin injections a day, prevented him from working. Lastly, the Board did not consider that the distinction between major disabilities and other types of disability amounted, as the applicant alleged, to discrimination."

Furthermore, the Government were convinced that the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act pursued a legitimate aim, which was to restore a degree of equality between those who actually did military or civilian service and those who, for whatever reason, were exempt. The tax was meant to make up for the efforts and obligations which those exempt from serving were spared."

In so far as the applicant argued that the distinction made between people with different degrees of disability was discriminatory, the Government pointed out that the legislation was framed so as to avoid exonerating everyone unfit for military service because of a disability from paying the tax, and to limit such exoneration to those persons mentioned in section 4 of the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act. Paragraph 1 ( a) of section 4 laid down three conditions for a person unfit for military service as a result of a disability to be exonerated from the tax: a “major” disability; income that did not exceed the minimum subsistence income; and a causal link between that income and the disability. The provision thus took into account the degree of physical or mental disability of the person concerned as well as their financial situation. A general exemption from the tax for all people with disabilities, of the type referred to by the applicant, would deny the very nature of the tax and would be incompatible with the principle of equal treatment."

With regard to physical disabilities, the Federal Court found, in keeping with legal opinion in Switzerland, that the prohibition of discrimination should be limited to people with disabilities of a certain gravity. The deciding factor was the risk of stigmatisation, denigration and social exclusion because of the disability. According to the Government the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act made distinctions based on these principles. The obligation to pay the exemption tax did not apply to people with major disabilities, that is, precisely those people who ran a risk of stigmatisation. In the Government ’ s opinion the applicant ran no such risk as he was only slightly inconvenienced in his everyday life. In the normal course of things his disability was not even noticeable and there was no reason why anyone but a limited circle of people should have known about it. The exemption tax did not change that, as no-one but the person concerned knew about it. For people with more severe disabilities, on the other hand, especially clearly visible disabilities, special arrangements were justified, and exonerating them from paying the tax was a means of not adding to the exclusion they suffered."

The table used by the Swiss National Insurance Fund in the event of an accident did not settle the question of whether this disease should be considered as a major disability within the meaning of section 4 ( 1 ) ( a) of the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act. Based on the medical certificate drawn up by a diabetes specialist from Zürich University Hospital on 14 May 2002, the federal tax authorities rated the applicant ’ s disability at less than 40%. This meant that it could not be considered as a major disability for the purposes of the Act in question in so far as, although it made him unfit for military service, it did not prevent him from working in various other capacities."

The distinctions made in the law were based on objective and reasonable considerations. In this particular case the Swiss authorities had correctly applied the law and could not, in the Government ’ s submission, be considered to have violated Article 14 of the Convention. On the contrary, they argued, discrimination much more serious than that which the applicant complained of would have resulted had he been exempted from paying the tax. It was true that a possible discrimination between people based on the seriousness of their disability would be eliminated, but the result would be that whatever the reason for exempting people from military service, and in particular where they were found to be unfit, they would be under no obligation to pay the exemption tax. This in turn would amount to discrimination against all those people who did do their compulsory military service."

It was discriminatory, he alleged, to allow conscientious objectors to do substitute service but not people declared unfit for military service because of a disability. In the circumstances, the applicant considered that he had in fact been penalised – as he had suffered a financial loss – when in fact he had been prevented against his will from doing his military service and had not been allowed to do civilian service instead. In his opinion there was no valid justification for such discrimination against people suffering from minor disabilities compared with people who were allowed to freely choose, such as conscientious objectors."

The applicant considered that neither the law nor the case-law provided clear guidance. The decision not to exonerate him from paying the exemption tax was based on the fact that his disability was less than 40%. That percentage was based on a single previous case concerning a person who had lost a leg – hardly a situation comparable to his own. It was therefore a discriminatory decision."

Clearly it does not serve to ensure that a sufficient number of people do their military service, as at the material time there were plenty of people ready and able to do military service. The Court also observes the recent tendency for European States to do away with conscription altogether in favour of regular armies ( for example, Spain (2002), Portugal (2004), Hungary and the Czech Republic (2005), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovakia (2006), and Romania, Italy and Latvia (2007) ).

In calculating the tax to be paid, Swiss law takes into account the degree of disability, exempting those persons who suffer from major disabilities. The Federal Court has defined the meaning of a “major” disability. In a 1998 judgment it ruled that it should be understood in the medical sense, not the disability insurance sense. It held that the disability caused by amputation of the leg at the knee was a “major” disability, corresponding to 40% on the disability scale ( see paragraph 33 above ). In a judgment of 2000, the Federal Court decided that what should be taken into consideration were the tables used by the Swiss National Insurance Fund, in the event of an accident, to calculate compensation for bodily harm in accordance with the federal law on accident insurance. According to the Government, the intention behind section 4 ( 1 ) (a) of the Federal Military - Service Exemption Tax Act was apparently not to generally exempt people with minor disabilities – and therefore capable of working and earning a normal salary – from the obligation to pay the tax."

It nevertheless considers that the manner in which the relevant domestic authorities proceeded in the present case was questionable. First of all they simply compared the applicant ’ s illness – which did not prevent him from working – with the case of a person whose leg had been amputated following an accident, and concluded that his disability was a minor one because it did not attain the 40% threshold.

According to the Government, that finding was based on the fact that he had to give himself an insulin injection four times a day. The Court is fully aware that where the organisation and operational effectiveness of the armed forces are concerned the States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 89, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI). It nevertheless wonders what prevented the authorities from setting in place special forms of service for people in a situation comparable to that of the applicant. For example, activities which, although carried out within the armed forces, required less physical effort and could therefore be performed by people like the applicant. In certain States the law provides for alternative forms of military service, in the armed forces, for people with partial disabilities.

It is true that in a large majority of the States substitute service is open only to conscientious objectors, as it is in Switzerland ( for the Swedish approach, which appears to be an exception, see paragraph 34 of the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe entitled “ Exercise of the right of conscientious objection to military service in Council of Europe member States ”, 4 May 2001, Doc. 8809 revised, available on the Internet).

It takes into account the particular circumstances of the case, including : the amount payable – which was not a negligible sum for the applicant – and the number of years over which it was charged; the fact that the applicant was willing to do military or civilian service; the lack of provision under Swiss law for forms of service suitable for people in the applicant ’ s situation, and the minor role the tax plays nowadays in terms of preventing or compensating for the avoidance of compulsory national service."

Essentially, the administrative judges, while vaguely acknowledging that the authorities ought to have applied the guidelines on persons with disabilities, quite simply exempted the respondent faculty from its duty to cater for the applicant, on the sole grounds that its building had been erected in 1988, before the guidelines had come into force.",

In so doing the court also refrained ( see paragraph 71 in fine above ) from seeking to identify the applicant ’ s real needs and the ways and means of meeting them, with a view to enabling Mr Enver Şahin to resume his studies under conditions as similar as possible to those provided for able-bodied students, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden on the authorities.",

In 2005, while he was a first-year mechanics student in the technical faculty of Fırat University ( “ the faculty” ), the applicant was seriously injured in an accident which left his lower limbs paralysed. He had to suspend his studies until he had recovered sufficiently to return to university.",

                "2. The faculty replied to that request by letter of 25 May 2007. It pointed out that the faculty building had been designed and built with several floors in order to accommodate 3, 000 students and that its architecture could not be adapted. It stated that the administration had been asked for leave to conduct redevelopment work on the doors to the building, but that that work could not be carried out in the short term. It added that the mechanics course required the applicant to participate in practical workshops, considering that as things stood such participation would cause problems. The faculty concluded that if the applicant wished to continue his studies it would help him as far as possible.",
                "3. On 16 August 2007 the applicant sent, through a notary, formal notice to the administration of Fırat University and the faculty dean inviting them to carry out the redevelopment work requested. Relying on Article 42 of the Constitution, section 15 of Law no. 5378 on persons with disabilities and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, he affirmed that it was the State ’ s duty to guarantee the citizens ’ right to education, in line with the principle of equal opportunities. He further alleged that the faculty ’ s reply to his request ( see paragraph 8 above ) had been intended solely to induce him to abandon his studies.",
                "4. The administration replied to that formal notice by letter of 10 September 2007. The latter stated that the redevelopment works mentioned should be considered in the light of compliance with the regulations on public property, which could take some time. Furthermore, any problems encountered by the applicant in attending the theoretical classes administered in a three-storey building could be resolved with the help of a companion.",
                "The Administration pointed out that the practical workshops were held on the ground floor of the building and posed no problems with regard to access, and that the applicant would consequently have no difficulty in attending the courses administered in the framework of those workshops. It explained that the only reason why the applicant ’ s participation in the practical workshops had previously been described as problematic ( see paragraph 8 above ) was that such workshops necessitated a considerable physical effort and that his particular situation required some thought regarding the type of assistance with which he could be provided. Furthermore, all the parties involved were anxious to help students in difficulty, and there was no question of deterring the applicant from continuing his studies. Finally, the Administration pointed out that since, in its view, the budget allocated by the State was limited, the redevelopment work necessitated by the applicant ’ s situation was subject to unavoidable budgetary and time constraints.",

On 15 November 2007 the applicant filed with the Elazığ Administrative Court an action for annulment of the university ’ s replies of 25 May and 10 September 2007 and to provide compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage which he claimed he had sustained. He complained that the authorities had not removed the physical obstacles preventing him from exercising his right to education. He claimed 25, 000 Turkish liras (TRY) in respect of non- pecuniary damage and TRY 30, 000 in respect of pecuniary damage.",

That document stated that the university had not been responsible for the applicant ’ s accident. It criticised the applicant for having opted for judicial channels, and alleged that he was acting in bad faith, adding, in that connection, that he had been informed that he would be provided with support should he decide to return to university. Furthermore, the relevant agencies had been contacted with a view to redeveloping the faculty building and a proposal had been made to include the works in an investment programme complying with the relevant regulations governing public property. The Administration further argued that it had offered the applicant the services of an assistant, but that he had not submitted any request for such help. The office added that access to the workshops posed no problems for persons with disabilities, but that the courses administered at the workshops demanded a physical effort from participants. Lastly, it pointed out that the applicant had never been barred from any course."

He submitted that his right to education was guaranteed by domestic law and by Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, and that it was incumbent on the domestic authorities to take steps to enable him to exercise that right, with respect for the principle of equal opportunities. Moreover, he argued that the redevelopment work requested was such as should already have been conducted in any case, in line with the requirements of section 1 bis of Law no. 3194 on urban planning ( see paragraph 23 above ). Furthermore, he considered that the authorities ’ offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. He added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy. He also pointed out that the fact of being carried upstairs by another individual comprised a definite risk of his falling."

In other words, access to any institution of higher education existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right set out in the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 ( see, inter alia, Mürsel Eren v. Turkey, no. 60856/00, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ II, and İrfan Temel and Others v. Turkey, no. 36458/02, § 39, 3 March 2009).",

The Government pointed out that Law no. 5378 had imposed an eight-year time-limit ( see paragraph 22 above ) on rendering public buildings, roads, pavements, pedestrian crossings, open spaces and parks, sports areas and other similar social and cultural infrastructures, as well as all buildings providing public services, accessible to persons with disabilities. They explained that during this procedure the authorities in charge of the university in question had stated that the applicant could continue his studies. Ever since 2010 the buildings of the faculty of technology set up under Legislative Decree no. 2009/15546 of 2 November 2009 ( see paragraph 15 above ), in which the engineering classes were now being held, had been in conformity with the provisions on access for students with disabilities."

The Government added that the applicant had neither reregistered at the faculty nor had recourse to the Student Amnesty Law ( see paragraph 24 above ) in order to return to the university and resume his studies. They affirmed that he could have continued his studies if he had taken up the opportunities offered to reregister. The regulations set out in Law no. 6353 (ibid. ) did not lay down any time-limit, and there was currently no obstacle to the resumption of his studies, provided that he submitted the relevant request. In that regard the Government submitted that the requisite redevelopment work had already been carried out in the new faculty buildings."

The applicant replied that the university authorities ’ dismissal of his request for measures geared to enabling him, as a person with a disability, to continue his studies had amounted to a violation of his right to education, as well as of his right to personal autonomy and self-fulfilment – which he described as aspects of his private life. He submitted that that violation had, furthermore, persisted until the authorities had taken the requisite action in the institution in question to remove the obstacles to his access to education, that is to say, as contended by the Government, until 2010-2011. The applicant considered, in that connection, that from the 2007-2008 academic year until the 2010 ‑ 2011 academic year he had found it physically impossible to resume his studies because he had had no means of accessing the rooms in which the classes were being held."

In the applicant ’ s view, even though he could have had recourse to the Student Amnesty Law in order to reregister with the faculty as from the 2010 ‑ 2011 academic year – when the physical accessibility of the classrooms would have been guaranteed – the damage which he claimed to have suffered during the period when, in his view, he had been deprived of education had not been redressed, and indeed the respondent Government had made no effort to redress it. The applicant added that the dismissal of his appeals by the administrative courts was a fact which could not be overlooked. He took the view that, in the final analysis, the national authorities had neither acknowledged nor provided redress for the violations of which he was complaining."

In the instant case, the Court observes that on 17 March 2007 the applicant lodged with the relevant university authorities a request for redevelopment work on their premises in order to ensure his access to them ( see paragraph 7 above ). When the authorities replied that such work could not be carried out in the short term, the applicant applied, in vain, to the administrative courts ( see paragraphs 11 to 20 above ).",

Moreover, according to the Government, the applicant is eligible for the provisions of the Student Amnesty Law enabling him to request reregistration at the university at any time ( see paragraphs 34 and 35 above ), which is not disputed by the applicant ( see paragraph 37 above )."

Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 105, ECHR 2010). In the present case, the redevelopment work carried out to accommodate persons with disabilities, as mentioned by the Government, is surely relevant here. However, the fact is that those improvements were not made until 2010 ( see paragraph 33 above ), apparently owing to budgetary and / or administrative constraints which had prevailed up to that date ( see paragraphs 8 and 10 above ).",

Germany, 15 July 1982, §§ 69 et seq., Series A no. 51; Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 44, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; and Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, §§ 115 and 116, ECHR 2010 ).",

Lastly, in 2014, following a further legislative amendment, an additional two-year period was granted for institutions which had not yet carried out the requisite work.

The applicant estimated the cost of that redevelopment work at some TRY 60,000 ( approximately 14, 620 euros (EUR)), which sum he considered eminently affordable for the authorities.

In that way any disabled student who was registered for a given course could now attend classes on the ground floor and, where necessary, in the classrooms of the different departments, which were readily accessible to persons with disabilities.

Serco would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party, which confined its membership to black people. The dividing line of colour or race was not made by Serco, but by the BNP which defines its own composition by colour or race. Mr Redfearn cannot credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people. The BNP cannot make a non-racial criterion (party membership) a racial one by the terms of its constitution limiting membership to white people.

A provision of ‘membership of the BNP’ could not be applied to a person who was not of the same colour as Mr Redfearn, because only persons of the same colour as him (white) are eligible to be members of the BNP. A more general and meaningful provision along similar lines would be one applying to membership of a political organisation like the BNP, which existed to promote views hostile to members of a different colour than those that belonged to the organisation. If such a provision were applied, however, it would not put persons of the same race as Mr Redfearn ‘at a particular disadvantage’ when compared with other persons within section 1(1A) of the 1976 Act.

They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State’s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the “very substance” of the right or freedom concerned ( Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 55, Series A no. 44, Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State’s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected “to have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers”."

The Government submitted that in the United Kingdom, where the qualifying period of one year’s service has been accrued, the 1996 Act would generally afford protection against dismissal on the grounds of political involvement, unless the employer could demonstrate that the involvement related to the capacity of the employee for performing the work in question or constituted “some other substantial reason” for the dismissal (see section 98(2) of the 1996 Act). If an employer was able to identify one of these two criteria, a fact-sensitive balancing exercise would have to be carried out. However, there was nothing to suggest that such a balancing exercise would be incompatible with the qualified rights under Article 11."

Finally, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period which an employee must serve before statutory protection is obtained in relation to dismissal pursued a legitimate aim, namely the creation of greater employment opportunities by encouraging companies to recruit. Indeed, in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith and Another [2000] UKHL 12 the House of Lords held that it was reasonable of the Secretary of State to consider that the risks of unjustified involvement with tribunals in unfair dismissal cases and the cost of such involvement could deter employers from giving more people jobs. Consequently, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period could not be said to fall outside the State’s margin of appreciation.",

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) submitted that even if the applicant had been employed in the public sector, his dismissal would have been justified as it was clear that a State could lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it was necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants ( Van der Heijden v. the Netherlands, app. no. 11002/84, 8 March 1985 and Kern v. Germany, app. no. 26870/04, 29 May 2007). The question whether a dismissal would breach Article 11 turned on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, the degree of contact he or she had with the public and whether or not it involved public trust and confidence, whether the employee had direct contact with or provided services to individuals against which the relevant group or party had expressed hostility, the extent of his involvement with the party or group, the effect his continued employment would have on the employer’s reputation, and the employee’s conduct during the period of employment."

The fact that the applicant was in direct contact with services users, a significant proportion of whom were of an ethnic or religious group towards which the BNP had expressed hostility, would render any interference with his rights under Article 11 proportionate."

Austria, 21 June 1988, §§ 32 ‑ 34, Series A no. 139, Gustafsson v. Sweden, 25 April 1996, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II, and Fuentes Bobo v.

Therefore, although the matters about which the applicant complained did not involve direct intervention or interference by the State, the United Kingdom’s responsibility will be engaged if these matters resulted from a failure on its part to secure to the applicant under domestic law his right to freedom of association. In other words there is also a positive obligation on the authorities to provide protection against dismissal by private employers where the dismissal is motivated solely by the fact that an employee belongs to a particular political party (or at least to provide the means whereby there can be an independent evaluation of the proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all the circumstances of a given case)."

In view of the nature of the BNP’s policies (see paragraph 9, above), the Court recognises the difficult position that Serco may have found itself in when the applicant’s candidature became public knowledge. In particular, it accepts that even in the absence of specific complaints from service users, the applicant’s membership of the BNP could have impacted upon Serco’s provision of services to Bradford City Council, especially as the majority of service users were vulnerable persons of Asian origin."

However, regard must also be had to the fact that the applicant was a “first-class employee” (see paragraph 7, above) and, prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues. Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role. In this regard, the Court considers that the case can readily be distinguished from that of Stedman v. the United Kingdom (cited above), in which the applicant was dismissed because she refused to work the hours required by the post. In particular, the Court is struck by the fact that these complaints, as summarised in paragraph 10, were in respect of prospective problems and not in respect of anything that the applicant had done or had failed to do in the actual exercise of his employment."

Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and Pay v. the United Kingdom, no. 32792/05, 16 September 2008), at the date of his dismissal he was fifty-six years old and it is therefore likely that he would have experienced considerable difficulty finding alternative employment."

The Court must therefore determine whether in the circumstances of the applicant’s case a fair balance was struck between the competing interests involved, namely the applicant’s Article 11 right and the risk, if any, that his continued employment posed for fellow employees and service users. It is also to be borne in mind that what the Court is called upon to do in this case is not to pass judgment on the policies or aims, obnoxious or otherwise, of the BNP at the relevant time (the BNP is, in any case, not a party to these proceedings), but solely to determine whether the applicant’s rights under Article 11 were breached in the particular circumstances of the instant case. In this connection it is also worth bearing in mind that, like the Front National-Nationaal Front in Féret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009) the BNP was not an illegal party under domestic law nor were its activities illegal (see, by way of contrast, Hizb Ut-Tahrir and Others v.

Once such a claim is lodged with the Employment Tribunal, it falls to the employer to demonstrate that there was a “substantial reason” for the dismissal.

The Court observes that the 1976 Act is concerned only with direct and indirect race discrimination. Although it would not go so far as to state that it amounted to a wholly ineffective remedy – indeed, it recalls that the applicant’s claim succeeded before the Employment Appeal Tribunal – the Court considers that the 1976 Act was not primarily intended to cover a situation such as the present one and a liberal interpretation of the relevant provisions was required in order for the domestic courts to find in the applicant’s favour.

Thus, the purpose of the one-year qualifying period was to benefit the domestic economy by increasing labour demand. The Court has received no submissions on the length of the qualifying period but it accepts that one year would normally be a sufficient period for an employer to assess the suitability of an employee before he or she became well-established in a post. Consequently, in view of the margin of appreciation afforded to Contracting States in formulating and implementing social and economic policies, the Court considers that it was in principle both reasonable and appropriate for the respondent State to bolster the domestic labour market by preventing new employees from bringing unfair dismissal claims."

Even if the Court were to acknowledge the legitimacy of Serco’s interest in dismissing the applicant from its workforce having regard to the nature of his political beliefs, the policies pursued by the BNP and his public identification with those policies through his election as a councillor, the fact remains that Article 11 is applicable not only to persons or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those whose views offend, shock or disturb (see, mutatis mutandis, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v.

For the Court, what is decisive in such cases is that the domestic courts or tribunals be allowed to pronounce on whether or not, in the circumstances of a particular case, the interests of the employer should prevail over the Article 11 rights asserted by the employee, regardless of the length of the latter’s period of employment."

She considered that there had been no grounds for a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation and that the relevant law should not be construed in a manner that allowed for such a possibility. She relied, inter alia, on the Constitution and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, arguing that even if she was not to be considered as D.B. ’ s “immediate family member”, within the meaning of the Aliens Act, she should in any case be considered as her “ other relative ” within the meaning of that Act."

It should also be taken into account that the provisions of the Aliens Act concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [the existence of] a same-sex union, nor does such a union fall within the scope of [the term] ‘ immediate family member ’ incorporated in that Act, which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant.",

It should be noted that section 56 of the [Aliens] Act explicitly enumerates persons who are to be considered immediate family members or who are to be exceptionally considered [so], which leads to a conclusion that it cannot be extended to cover persons living in a same-sex union.",

In the case at issue the plaintiff is neither married nor in an extramarital relationship with the Croatian national D.B., which is not in dispute between the parties. It therefore follows that the plaintiff cannot be considered an immediate family member within the meaning of section 56 § 1(1) and (2) of the [Aliens] Act and thus she did not justify the purpose (in the concrete case: family reunification) for which a temporary residence of an alien in Croatia can be granted ...",

In addition, the Government referred to the fact that the Prevention of Discrimination Act also provided an alternative avenue under section 16, allowing an individual to raise his or her discrimination complaint as a preliminary issue in the main proceedings, but they considered that the applicant had failed to raise that matter properly in the administrative proceedings concerning her request for family reunification."

Any possible argument concerning the protection of family in the traditional sense was inapplicable in this context since there had been various other less restrictive means for achieving that aim. The applicant also stressed that her request for a residence permit on the ground of family reunification with her partner had been dismissed at the outset since the relevant domestic law per se excluded the possibility of family reunification of same-sex couples.

In the Government ’ s view, in the case at issue the applicant had failed to demonstrate that she had had family life with D.B. In particular, she had not lived with D.B. or otherwise demonstrated their mutual commitment to a family life. The fact that she wanted to move and live with D.B. and to start their common business could not amount to the recognition of a de facto family life. Moreover, the Government did not wish to speculate as to whether the matter concerned the applicant ’ s private life, since the right to a residence permit in Croatia could not be considered under the applicant ’ s right to respect for her private life.

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 71, Series A no. 94; and E.B. v.

Austria, no. 30141/04, § 91, ECHR 2010). In contrast, the Court ’ s case-law has for a long time only accepted that the emotional and sexual relationship of a same-sex couple constitutes “private life” but has not found that it constitutes “family life”, even where a long - term relationship of cohabiting partners was at stake. In coming to that conclusion, the Court observed that despite the growing tendency in a number of European States towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto same-sex partnerships, given the existence of little common ground between the Contracting States, this was an area in which they still enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation (see Mata Estevez, cited above, with further references)."

Since then, a considerable number of member States have afforded legal recognition to same-sex couples. Certain provisions of European Union law also reflect a growing tendency to include same-sex couples in the notion of “family” (see paragraphs 36-37 above). In view of this evolution, the Court considered it artificial to maintain the view that, in contrast to a different-sex couple, a same-sex couple could not enjoy “family life” for the purposes of Article 8. It therefore held that the relationship of a cohabiting same-sex couple living in a stable de facto partnership fell within the notion of “family life”, just as the relationship of a different-sex couple in the same situation would (see P.B. and J.S. v.

The Court observes that in the Croatian legal system an extramarital relationship is defined as an union between an unmarried woman and man which has lasted for at least three years, or less if a child was born of the union. At the relevant time this definition was provided under the Family Act whereas the applicable Aliens Act, in defining the scope of the term “family” under section 56, only made reference to an “ extramarital relationship” (see paragraphs 19-20 above). At the same time, same-sex union was defined as a union between two persons of the same sex who are not married, or in an extramarital relationship or other same-sex union, which has lasted for at least three years and which is based on the principles of equality of partners, mutual respect and assistance as well as the emotional bonds of partners (see paragraph 22 above). The Aliens Act made no reference to a same-sex union with regard to the possibility of obtaining a residence permit for family reunification (see paragraph 19 above)."

It follows from the above that by recognising both extramarital relationships of different-sex couples and same-sex couples the Croatian legal system recognised in general the possibility that both categories of couples are capable of forming stable committed relationships (see, in this respect, Schalk and Kopf, cited above, 99; and Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 78). In any case, a partner in a same-sex relationship, as the applicant, who applied for a residence permit for family reunification so he or she could pursue the intended family life in Croatia is in a comparable situation to a partner in a different-sex extramarital relationship as regards the same intended manner of making his or her family life possible."

The Court notes, however, that the relevant provisions of the Aliens Act expressly reserved the possibility of applying for a residence permit for family reunification to different-sex couples, married or living in an extramarital relationship (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Accordingly, by tacitly excluding same-sex couples from its scope, the Aliens Act in question introduced a difference in treatment based on the sexual orientation of the persons concerned (compare Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 79; and paragraph 23 above, concerning the subsequent changes in the relevant legislation)."

With regard to the Government ’ s argument that the applicant was not in a comparable situation to different-sex couples living in an extramarital relationship given that she had not been in a relationship with D.B. for a period of three years, the Court firstly notes that when dismissing the applicant ’ s action the Administrative Court did not carry out any investigation into the circumstances of the case nor did it deal with the question of the relevance of the period in which the applicant was in a relationship with D.B. for its decision concerning her request for family reunification. Instead, it relied on the legal impossibility argument alone, finding that it was not possible under the limitations imposed by the Aliens Act to grant the applicant ’ s request (see paragraph 14 above). It also follows from the decision of the Ministry that the legal impossibility of obtaining a residence permit for family reunification by a partner in a same-sex relationship was at the centre of the domestic authorities ’ considerations (see paragraph 12 above; and compare X and Others v. Austria, cited above, §§ 118-119 and 123)."

Nevertheless, as already noted above, the Administrative Court did not consider it pertinent to examine the relevant factual aspects of the applicant ’ s case as it relied on the legal impossibility of obtaining a residence permit for family reunification by a partner in a same-sex relationship. This accordingly prevents the Court from speculating what would be the possible Administrative Court ’ s decision if it had considered that the family reunification of same-sex couples was possible under the relevant domestic law."

Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 or any other Convention provision cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to, for instance, authorise family reunion in its territory (see Jeunesse, cited above, § 107; and Gül v. Switzerland, 19 February 1996, § 38, Reports 1996 ‑ I; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 38, ECHR 2011).

Indeed, it is the Court ’ s well-established case-law that although Article 8 does not include a right to settle in a particular country or a right to obtain a residence permit, the State must nevertheless exercise its immigration policies in a manner which is compatible with a foreign national ’ s human rights, in particular the right to respect for his or her private or family life and the right not to be subject to discrimination (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, §§ 59-60; Kiyutin, cited above, § 53). Even in cases in which the State that has gone beyond its obligations under Article 8 in creating a right – a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention – it cannot, in the application of that right, take discriminatory measures within the meaning of Article 14 (see, for instance, E.B. v.

Such justification must be objective and reasonable or, in other words, it must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see paragraph 55 above )."

In cases in which the margin of appreciation afforded to States is narrow, as is the position where there is a difference in treatment based on sex or sexual orientation (see paragraph 59 above), the principle of proportionality does not merely require the measure chosen to be suitable in principle for achievement of the aim sought. It must also be shown that it was necessary, in order to achieve that aim, to exclude certain categories of people – in this instance persons in a same-sex relationship – from the scope of application of the relevant domestic provisions at issue (see Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 85). This equality requirement holds true in the immigration cases as well where States are otherwise allowed a wide margin of appreciation (see paragraph 58 above)."

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State’s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest. Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of the alien concerned and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Butt v.

It is of importance at the outset that there has been no appearance of any objective obstacle to the enjoyment of family life outside the Netherlands. Taking into account the young age of the appellant’s children, it can also reasonably be expected that they would follow the appellant to Suriname for the duration of the proceedings relating to the provisional residence visa. This is not altered by the fact that both children are Netherlands nationals. The fact that the appellant’s husband is currently being detained gives no cause for finding that ... there is an objective obstacle.",

This cannot succeed, for the following reasons. The case of Rodrigues da Silva did not concern a temporary separation in connection with maintaining the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, so the case cannot be said to be comparable. In the cases of Said Botan and Ibrahim Mohamed the European Court found that the reasons for lodging the complaints had been removed, because a residence permit had been granted to the complainants in those cases. For that reason, their complaints were not considered further. The Regional Court fails to see in what manner the European Court’s findings in those two cases could be of relevance to the appellant’s case.",

In the decision of 11 March 2009, the situation of the appellant’s two minor children was explicitly taken into account in the assessment.

While accepting that there was family life within the meaning of Article 8 between the applicant, her husband and their children, the Minister found that there was no interference with the right to respect for family life as the refusal to grant the applicant’s request for exemption did not deprive her of a residence permit which enabled her to exercise her family life in the Netherlands."

As to the question whether the applicant’s rights under Article 8 entailed a positive obligation for the Netherlands to grant her a residence permit, the Minister found that the interests of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicant’s personal interest in exercising her right to family life in the Netherlands. In balancing these competing interests, the Minister took into account the following: already in Suriname and before her arrival in the Netherlands the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse; she had entered the Netherlands without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules; and she had created her family in the Netherlands without holding a residence permit. When it transpired in the course of the proceedings that the applicant was pregnant, the Minister further held that it had not been established, nor did it appear that the applicant would be unable – should hospitalisation be necessary – to give birth in a hospital in Suriname or that there would be any insurmountable objective obstacles to the exercise of family life in Suriname. On this point, the Minister noted that Dutch was spoken in Suriname and that the transition would not therefore be particularly difficult for the applicant’s children, who could continue their education in Suriname in a normal manner."

The Netherlands authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant’s personal choice to come to, settle and create a family in the Netherlands without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence. In the balancing exercise, the Minister attributed decisive weight to the fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the Netherlands and that there was no indication whatsoever that it would be impossible to exercise family life in Suriname."

She had met with several refusals of her applications for a Netherlands residence permit but had nevertheless opted each time to file a fresh request, thus accepting the risk that, at some point in time, she would have to leave the Netherlands, at least, temporarily. The Minister further considered that the applicant had been born and raised in Suriname where she had resided most of her life and, given her age, she should be regarded as capable of returning to and fending for herself in Suriname, if need be with financial and/or material support from the Netherlands, pending the determination of an application for a provisional residence visa to be filed by her in Suriname. The Minister concluded on this point that the case disclosed no circumstances warranting a finding that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted exceptional hardship within the meaning of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree 2000."

                "“2.4.1. It must be examined whether the defendant could have refused to exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa, as required under section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, on the ground that removal is not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.",
                "2.4.2. It is not in dispute between the parties that there is family life between the appellant and her husband and their three minor children. Refusing the application [for a residence permit] does not constitute interference within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. No residence permit which actually enabled the appellant to enjoy family life in the Netherlands has been taken away from her. The subsequent question arises whether there exist such facts and circumstances that the right to respect for family life may be said to entail a positive obligation for the defendant to allow the applicant to reside [in the Netherlands]. In making this assessment, a ‘fair balance’ must be found between, on the one hand, the interests of the alien concerned in enjoying family life in the Netherlands and, on the other, the general interest of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy. In this balancing exercise, the defendant has a certain margin of appreciation.",
                "2.4.3. It was reasonable for the defendant to attach more weight to the general interest of the Netherlands State than to the personal interests of the appellant and her family members. The defendant did not have to accept an obligation to grant the appellant residence in the Netherlands on the basis of Article 8 of the Convention. In this balancing exercise, the defendant was entitled to weigh heavily to the appellant’s disadvantage the fact that she had started family life in the Netherlands when she had not been granted a residence permit for this purpose, and that she had further intensified her family life despite the refusal of her requests for residence. This is not altered by the fact that for a certain period the appellant was lawfully resident while awaiting the outcome of proceedings concerning a request for a residence permit.",
                "2.4.4. The defendant was entitled to take the position that the consequences of the appellant’s choices were at her own risk. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights ( Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands [no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I]), where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted, removal will lead to a violation of Article 8 only in the most exceptional circumstances. The appellant has not established that, as regards her and her family, there are such exceptional circumstances. Her reliance on the judgments in Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer and Nunez v. Norway (no. 55597/09, 28 June 2011) fails, as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva and Nunez. In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin. With the removal of the mother, contact with the children would become impossible. However, in the appellant’s case, it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there. The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering Suriname. The consequence of her husband’s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the Netherlands to the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and Venezuela during the period between 2 August 2009 and 2 August 2012. This does not mean that it is self-evident that the husband will not be admitted to Suriname. The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to Suriname in another manner. In addition, it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature.",
                "2.4.5. No other circumstances have appeared on the basis of which the existence of an objective obstacle to continued family life in Suriname must be accepted. There is also no question of excessive formalism. The appellant’s situation is not comparable to the one in the case of Rodrigues da Silva. The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise. The children were all born in the Netherlands and hold Netherlands nationality. At the time the impugned decision was taken, they were respectively eleven, six and one year old. The children have always lived in the Netherlands. Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the Netherlands, the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in Suriname. In this connection it is also relevant that Dutch is spoken in Suriname and that both parents hail from Suriname.",
                "2.4.6. This is not altered by the fact that the appellant’s husband and children hold Netherlands nationality and, on the basis of Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘TFEU’), can derive rights from their EU citizenship. It can be deduced from the considerations of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ‘ECJ’) in the Dereci et al. judgment of 15 November 2011 (C-256/11), in which a further explanation is given of the Ruiz Zambrano judgment of 8 March 2011 (C-34/09), that in answering the question whether a citizen of the EU who enjoys family life with a third-country national will be denied the right to reside in EU territory flowing directly from Article 20 of the TFEU, only a limited importance is given to the right to respect for family life. As follows from paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Dereci judgment, this right is not, as such, protected by Article 20 of the TFEU but by other international, EU and domestic rules and regulations, such as Article 8 of the Convention, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, EU Directives and section 15 of the Aliens Act 2000. In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the Netherlands or the European Union is, inter alia, also of limited importance.",

The situation of an EU citizen being denied the right to reside in EU territory arises only when the EU citizen is so dependent on the third-country national that, as a consequence of the decision by the defendant, he has no other choice than to stay with that national outside EU territory. In the appellant’s case, that has not occurred. The appellant’s children can be cared for by their father. The father also has Netherlands nationality. The appellant’s husband and children are not obliged or actually compelled to go with her to Suriname in connection with the application for a provisional residence visa. Their rights as EU citizens are thus not breached.",

                "65 Indeed, in the case leading to that judgment, the question arose as to whether a refusal to grant a right of residence to a third country national with dependent minor children in the Member State where those children are nationals and reside and a refusal to grant such a person a work permit would have such an effect. The Court considered in particular that such a refusal would lead to a situation where those children, who are citizens of the Union, would have to leave the territory of the Union in order to accompany their parents. In those circumstances, those citizens of the Union would, in fact, be unable to exercise the substance of the rights conferred on them by virtue of their status as citizens of the Union (see Ruiz Zambrano, paragraphs 43 and 44).",
                "66 It follows that the criterion relating to the denial of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of European Union citizen status refers to situations in which the Union citizen has, in fact, to leave not only the territory of the Member State of which he is a national but also the territory of the Union as a whole.",
                "67 That criterion is specific in character inasmuch as it relates to situations in which, although subordinate legislation on the right of residence of third country nationals is not applicable, a right of residence may not, exceptionally, be refused to a third country national, who is a family member of a Member State national, as the effectiveness of Union citizenship enjoyed by that national would otherwise be undermined.",

As to the question of compliance with this provision, the Court reiterates that a State is entitled, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, to control the entry of aliens into its territory and their residence there. The Convention does not guarantee the right of a foreign national to enter or to reside in a particular country (see, for instance, Nunez, cited above, § 66).

Where a Contracting State tolerates the presence of an alien in its territory thereby allowing him or her to await a decision on an application for a residence permit, an appeal against such a decision or a fresh application for a residence permit, such a Contracting State enables the alien to take part in the host country’s society, to form relationships and to create a family there. However, this does not automatically entail that the authorities of the Contracting State concerned are, as a result, under an obligation pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention to allow him or her to settle in their country. In a similar vein, confronting the authorities of the host country with family life as a fait accompli does not entail that those authorities are, as a result, under an obligation pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention to allow the applicant to settle in the country.

In such cases, the Court will examine whether the interference is justified under the second paragraph of Article 8. In this connection, it will have regard to the various criteria which it has identified in its case-law in order to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the grounds underlying the authorities’ decision to withdraw the right of residence and the Article 8 rights of the individual concerned (see, for instance, Boultif v.

Rather, the question to be examined in the present case is whether, having regard to the circumstances as a whole, the Netherlands authorities were under a duty pursuant to Article 8 to grant her a residence permit, thus enabling her to exercise family life on their territory. The instant case thus concerns not only family life but also immigration. For this reason, the case at hand is to be seen as one involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (see Ahmut v. the Netherlands, 28 November 1996, § 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI).

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State’s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest. Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of the alien concerned and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Butt v.

The central issue in this case is whether, bearing in mind the margin of appreciation afforded to States in immigration matters, a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests at stake, namely the personal interests of the applicant, her husband and their children in maintaining their family life in the Netherlands on the one hand and, on the other, the public order interests of the respondent Government in controlling immigration. In view of the particular circumstances of the case, it is questionable whether general immigration policy considerations of themselves can be regarded as sufficient justification for refusing the applicant residence in the Netherlands."

The Court considers that when investigating violent incidents State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any political motive and to establish whether or not intolerance towards a dissenting political opinion may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating politically induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no political overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v.

After waiting for a moment next to his office, he took me to the Head of the Criminal Investigation Unit [H.M.]. There [H.M.] started talking and said “Grisha, what is this all about the demonstrations you are holding and the government you are changing? You are upsetting the stability of the country” and things like that[. H]e also said that I had taken people to the demonstrations and added that I had taken with me, for instance, [G.A.]. I asked whether [G.A.] could come and prove that I had taken him to the demonstrations and added that he had his own brain to decide what to do. [H.M.] left the office telling me that he would be back soon. A little while later I was invited to go to the office of the deputy chief of police [G.]. When I entered [G.’s] office he asked me why I was talking loudly in the hallway and why I was organising a demonstration in the building [of the police station]. I answered that I had not been in the hallway and had not organised any demonstration. [G.] said that I was using foul language to him there and then and ordered that a case be prepared on account of my committing an administrative offence. I and [R.S.] came back to his office where he, in the presence of [another police officer, A.M.], said that he would not prepare materials against me and left the room. A little while later [A.M.] was called[. H]e went away, then returned and started preparing some documents. He inquired about my personal details but I refused to say anything and only said that I had higher education. A little while later [H.M.] came. [A.M.] told him that I refused to provide any information about myself. He ordered [A.M.] to go and bring form no. 1. [A.M.] left and came back with a piece of paper on which I could see my photo. [A.M.] filled in some documents and asked me to sign them[. I] answered that I would not sign any documents. At that moment a girl came to [A.M.’s office]. He told the girl to type a court document. [A.M.], apparently having finished filling in the documents, was about to go, probably to fetch the court document. I understood by now that I was going to be taken to a court and sentenced to an “overnight”. Besides, [A.M.] also said that they were about to take me to a court and left the office. At that moment [H.M.] entered the office. I was sitting in front of one of the desks. Upon entering the office he immediately started swearing at me, also saying that it was their country and that they could do anything they wanted to and that what we were trying to do, meaning the change of the government, was all in vain. I answered: “You do what you think is right and we will do what we consider to be right”[. A]t that moment [H.M.] kicked me. The blow fell on the left side of my chest. He kicked me with the sharp tip of his shoe. I felt sharp pain in the area of my ribs. He immediately punched me twice in the face with his left fist. At that moment I lost my temper and to defend myself picked up the mobile phone charger from the desk and hit him with it. The cable stayed in my hand while the charger broke off and hit [H.M.’s] face. I saw him holding his eye and screaming. At that moment [A.M.] entered the office and, seeing the chaotic situation, took me to the nearby office. [H.M. and another police officer, A.A.,] followed me there and started beating me. I fell down but they went on beating me. They were kicking and punching me. Then other officers came and took [H.M. and A.A.] out. I would like to indicate that at the very beginning both [H.M. and A.A.] kicked me on my testicles. Some while after [H.M. and A.A.] had been taken away from the office, [another police officer A.K.] came to the office [(I learned his name and position from other officers after the incident)] and started swearing at me, trying to humiliate me, twice spat on me and punched my testicles[. Then] he kicked my feet several times and left. Before leaving he hit me again on my testicles with his keys. [A.K.], before beating me in the office, ordered everybody to leave, saying that he was going to abuse me. After he left [A.A.] entered the office and started beating me again, demanding that I stand upright. He was hitting and saying “Hit back! Why don’t you hit back now?” Some time later an ambulance doctor came to check whether I was drunk. I told her that I was not drunk. They contacted the chief of traffic inspection and asked for an “ampoule”. [Another police officer, A.H.,] brought the ampoule. The doctor broke the edge of the ampoule and I blew in it. At that time I was asserting again that I was not drunk. [A.H.] hit me on my forehead. He hit me twice on my forehead. It seemed like he wanted to show deliberately that he was defending the honour of the uniform. I was in a terrible condition[. I] asked [another police officer, M.B.,] and he gave me some water, then poured it on my head, back and face for me to regain consciousness. [Another police officer, R.H.,] also helped me; he removed my handcuffs, realising of course that I was in a bad condition...”"

The testimonies of police officers A.A., R.S., H.M. and A.K. were false and lacked any probative value, since these persons were the perpetrators of his brutal beating. Furthermore, the police officers of the Artashat Police Department had been persecuting him since March 2004 and the anonymous phone call of 23 April 2004 was a mere set-up. Because of a slow and biased investigation the above-mentioned persons had managed to avoid criminal responsibility. In particular, the investigating authority had failed to arrange immediate confrontations and did so only in July 2004, thereby allowing the police officers to coordinate their testimonies, while the conclusions of the forensic medical expert were not impartial. No criminal proceedings had been instituted, while the perpetrators were questioned only two months after the incident, which suggested that the case was of a political nature and enjoyed a high-ranking patronage. The fact of his systematic ill-treatment on the night of 23 April 2004 was confirmed by the relevant hospital papers and there were sufficient grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers as required by Articles 175 and 176 of the CCP (see paragraph 105 and 106 below).

Further, no police officer had been punished for inflicting such injury upon Virabyan.",

The person’s behaviour in the institution may not serve as a justification for injuring him, and the staff have the duty to be tolerant.",

The circumstances of the case were discussed, and it was assumed that an impartial investigation of the case would be ensured. However, no progress was reported. With this background, the Prosecutor General was requested to assign another investigative authority to investigate the case; this request was granted, and [the Erebuni District Prosecutor’s Office] was instructed to investigate the case. However, there was still no progress, and Virabyan was still the only one being charged. By that time his indictment was ready to be sent to court. The Prosecutor General ordered that the charges be dropped only after the Defender intervened.”"

At that time, the international community warned the Armenian government that its intimidation of the opposition through the use of arrests and administrative detentions must stop.

More precisely, the applicant was entitled under Article 290 of the CCP (see paragraph 114 above) to contest the decisions of the investigating authority before the domestic courts. The applicant successfully exercised this right by instituting two sets of proceedings: the first one contesting the investigator’s decision of 7 June 2004 rejecting his allegations of ill-treatment and the second one contesting the prosecutor’s decision of 30 August 2004 terminating the criminal proceedings against him. The six months period must be calculated from the date of the final decision in the first set of proceedings, which was taken by the Court of Cassation on 24 September 2004. The application, which had been lodged with the Court only on 10 November 2005, was therefore out of time. The Government argued that the applicant’s submission that the six months period must be calculated from the date of the final decision in the second set of proceedings, namely 13 May 2005, was ill-founded, since those proceedings concerned a different issue, namely the termination of the criminal proceedings, and none of the court decisions taken in those proceedings concerned the applicant’s request to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of ill-treatment or contained any ruling on the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment."

More precisely, the prosecutor dismissed his complaint just five days later, namely on 7 June 2004, without carrying out any official and independent investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment and basing his findings solely on the results of the preliminary investigation carried out in the context of the criminal case against him. His appeals lodged with the courts against the decision of 7 June 2004 were also ineffective because the courts refused to examine them in substance on the ground that the impugned decision was a procedural decision and they lacked jurisdiction to do so. In such circumstances, both the prosecutor’s decision of 7 June 2004 and the Court of Cassation’s decision of 24 September 2004 could not be considered as a “final decision” within the meaning of Article 35 § 1."

Had he succeeded in this appeal, he would have been afforded an effective remedy, such as an official recognition of the fact that he had struck the police officer in self-defence which would necessarily have implied a finding that he had been ill-treated in detention.

The Government disputed that argument, claiming that the applicant’s appeals lodged with the courts against the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the trial were not effective remedies to be exhausted. In this respect, the Court observes that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute not capable of being applied automatically; it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see Akulinin and Babich v.

In the present case, as already indicated above, the applicant’s complaint seeking to have criminal proceedings instituted against the perpetrators of the alleged ill-treatment was examined in substance in the context of the criminal proceedings against him rather than as a separate issue and resulted in the investigator’s decision of 7 June 2004 taken in the context of those proceedings. Even the Court of Cassation, in refusing to examine the merits of the applicant’s appeal against that decision, stated that there was no need to institute a separate set of proceedings because the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment were closely linked to the subject matter of the criminal case against him and were to be examined in its context (see paragraph 84 above). Furthermore, as already indicated above, such treatment of the applicant’s complaint prevented him from putting the matter before the courts through the appeal procedure envisaged for cases in which a decision to reject the institution of criminal proceedings is taken pursuant to Article 181 of the CCP. Thus, the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, having been deprived of any other form of judicial review, the applicant cannot be blamed for trying to avail himself of judicial protection in respect of his allegations of ill-treatment by raising them in the course of the trial against him (see, mutatis mutandis, Akulinin and Babich, cited above, §§ 25-34, and Vladimir Fedorov, cited above, §§ 41-50)."

Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion that such avenue of exhaustion pursued by the applicant was not, in principle, a prima facie futile attempt incapable of providing redress. In particular, since the trial against the applicant was discontinued by a prosecutor’s decision, his criminal case was put before the courts for the first time following his appeal against that decision. In his appeal to the courts the applicant complained inter alia about his alleged ill-treatment and the inadequacy of the investigation and requested that criminal proceedings be instituted (see paragraph 86 above). Even if the courts were primarily called upon to determine the question of whether the termination of the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the grounds provided in the prosecutor’s decision was lawful, nevertheless, in reviewing that decision, they were required under Article 17 § 4 of the CCP to examine any complaints alleging a violation of lawfulness in the course of the proceedings, including the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. Furthermore, even if the courts were not vested with power to institute criminal proceedings, they were entitled to apply with such a request to a prosecutor under Articles 41 § 2(4) and 184 § 1 of the CCP. Lastly, the courts were entitled under Article 264 of the CCP to quash the prosecutor’s decision discontinuing the trial and to order a further investigation into the circumstances of the charge against the applicant which were closely linked to his allegations of ill-treatment."

It is true that both the District Court and the Court of Appeal failed to address any of the allegations raised in the applicant’s appeal (see paragraphs 87 and 89 above). However, this became the reason why the Court of Cassation decided to quash the decision of the Court of Appeal and to remit the case for a fresh examination. In doing so, the Court of Cassation took cognisance of the applicant’s allegations, including his allegations of ill-treatment and inadequate investigation, and ordered, with reference to Article 17 § 4 of the CCP, that they be duly addressed in a reasoned decision (see paragraphs 91 and 92 above). Furthermore, during the subsequent fresh examination of the case, both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation examined and dismissed the applicant’s claims of self-defence which were closely linked to and could not be separated from his allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraphs 93 and 95 above).

Accordingly, the six months period provided for in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention should be considered to have started running from the date of the final decision in those proceedings, namely 13 May 2005.

The applicant was the first to assault a police officer by hitting him with a mobile phone charger and was prevented from continuing his assault by other police officers, as a result of which he – together with the injured police officer – fell on a chair and then on the floor, sustaining the injuries in question. The Government claimed that the materials of the applicant’s criminal case contained sufficient evidence supporting this account of events, including the forensic medical expert reports which stated that the applicant’s injuries could have been caused as a result of the said incident.

In contrast, the testimonies of the police officers provided during the investigation contained numerous inconsistencies. The circumstances of his police custody, namely his being interviewed without a lawyer and the interview not being recorded, reveal a disregard for safeguards against abuse. Furthermore, according to the official account of events, he had been examined by a doctor for alcohol intoxication following the alleged incident.

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Salman, cited above, § 114)."

These injuries had lasting consequences for his health, as his left testicle was so badly smashed that it had to be removed. He was further beaten up with his hands handcuffed behind his back and received blows to his chest and ribs. Strong inferences can be drawn from the circumstances of the case that the ill-treatment was inflicted on the applicant intentionally in order either to punish or to intimidate him or both.

Furthermore, the preliminary investigation had been carried out by the same investigator who had instituted criminal proceedings and brought charges against him and collected evidence in support of that charge, which was based entirely on the statements made by the alleged perpetrators. The investigator, when interviewing the police officers, had not asked any questions, nor had he considered any of the inconsistencies in the police evidence or taken evidence from other witness, including his State-appointed lawyer. The initial forensic medical examination had been flawed, incomplete and not prompt, while the second one had been conducted with a significant delay and was incapable of producing credible findings.

The applicant alleged that forensic expert G. started his examination only on 5 May 2004. It is not entirely clear from the expert’s report whether this was the case, but it can be safely assumed that the expert did not commence the examination at least three days after the investigator’s decision (see paragraphs 40 and 52 above).

Secondly, the report failed to give any answer to one of the key questions posed by the investigator, namely whether the injury to the applicant’s testicle was caused by one or several blows, which, given the circumstances of the case and the conflicting versions of events, was crucial for the investigation. Thirdly, the expert’s initial conclusion contained a phrase – “The injury to the left testicle has a traumatic origin and could have been caused by any type of blow ” (emphasis added, see paragraph 52 above) which could be seen as suggesting a broad spectrum of possible causes for the applicant’s injuries but which, for unexplained reasons, was deleted from the updated version of the same conclusion (see paragraph 56 above).

However, this happened after a significant lapse of time, which was mainly due to the fact that a copy of that report was presented to the applicant only about one and a half months after it had been produced (see paragraphs 68 above). As a result, the new forensic medical examination was not initiated until almost three months after the incident. The Court is convinced that such a delayed examination was not capable of providing an accurate record of the applicant’s injuries and consequently leading to credible findings.

The Court is further struck by the fact that the investigating authorities failed to make any assessment of other medical evidence in the case, namely the records of Artashat Hospital which, as already indicated above, revealed injuries to the applicant’s chest and ribs in addition to those to his testicles (see paragraph 66 above), which were missing from the forensic expert’s findings. It appears that no account was taken of this obviously important evidence at any stage of the investigation. Despite the seriousness of the applicant’s injuries, the investigating authorities did not examine the hospital records or question the relevant doctors until almost two and a half months after the incident (see paragraphs 71 and 73 above) and, even then, it appears that no importance was given to this evidence and no conclusions were drawn. No attempts were made to resolve the discrepancy between this evidence and the findings of the forensic expert, including by questioning the latter, and no answer was given to the question of whether the applicant’s injuries in their entirety could have been caused in the circumstances alleged by the police officers."

                "175. The Court further points out the failure of the investigating authority immediately to isolate and question the police officers involved in the incident, thereby failing to prevent a possible collusion. In this respect, the Court notes that the very first police reports on the incident did not mention anything about the applicant falling face-down on a chair (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above), an explanation which was later relied on to justify his injuries. Such explanation, nevertheless, started to appear consistently in almost all the statements taken by the investigator during the subsequent interviews with the police officers (see, for example, paragraphs 23, 24 and 35 above). Furthermore, having regard to the manner in which those interviews were conducted, the Court observes that on several such occasions the police officers were simply asked to provide their account of events and no questions whatsoever were put to them (see paragraphs 25, 35 and 39 above). Even on those few occasions when the investigator did ask questions, there were never more than one or two questions and in most cases the questions asked were of a standard nature and lacked specificity (see paragraphs 23, 24, 44, 47 and 50 above). The interviews in question therefore appear to have been a pure formality and the Court cannot regard them as a serious and timely attempt to establish the circumstances in which the applicant suffered his injuries."

                "176. It must also be noted in this respect that the interviews in question were conducted in the above-mentioned non-inquisitive manner despite a number of worrying discrepancies and ambiguities apparent in the case. In particular, it is not clear why the hospital records indicated that the doctor’s first visit to the police station, whose purpose was to determine the applicant’s level of intoxication, was made at around 3.05 p.m. on 23 April 2004 (see paragraph 66 above), while according to the police records the applicant was arrested not before 5.40 p.m. On the other hand, the record of the applicant’s intoxication examination indicates that the first visit took place at around 7 p.m. (see paragraph 18 above), which suggests that there may have been a mistake in the hospital records. However, even assuming that this was the case, it is highly surprising that the applicant, who had already suffered – allegedly at 6.30 p.m. (see paragraphs 27 and 48 above) – injuries to his chest and a very serious injury to his testicle, did not report any of this to the doctor examining him for alcohol intoxication. Moreover, assuming that the applicant had been in such an emergency condition since 6.30 p.m., it is not clear why an ambulance was called to provide first aid only at 11.20 p.m. (see paragraph 29 above). As already indicated above, no efforts were made to clarify these important circumstances when taking statements from the police officers. Nor were any relevant questions put to doctor A.G. who had made both visits to the police station on the day of the incident (see paragraph 71 above)."

Firstly, no attempt was ever made to question the applicant’s state-appointed lawyer, who was apparently present at his questioning on the night of the incident (see paragraph 28 above), or police officer O.B., who had drawn up the record indicating that the applicant felt unwell and required medical assistance (see paragraph 29 above). Secondly, confrontations between the applicant and the police officers were held with delays of about one and a half up to three and a half months (see paragraphs 63, 64, 67 and 78 above), thereby significantly minimising the effectiveness of these measures, while no confrontation was held between the applicant and deputy chief of police G. Thirdly, it is not clear on what grounds the prosecutor’s decision terminating the criminal proceedings stated that police officer H.M. in self-defence had kicked the applicant’s testicles (see paragraph 82 above) when none of the evidence in the case appears to have contained such an allegation. Lastly, the domestic courts failed to address thoroughly any of the above-mentioned shortcomings in the investigation during what appears to have been a cursory examination of the applicant’s allegations (see paragraphs 93 and 95 above)."

While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was politically motivated (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others [GC], cited above, § 147, and Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, § 63)."

                "213. In the present case, the applicant alleged that the violent behaviour towards him in police custody was motivated by the fact that he was a member of the political opposition. The police officers repeatedly made remarks of a political nature when taking him to the police station, at the police station and while ill-treating him. Notably, police officer H.M. before assaulting the applicant by kicking and punching him said that “it was their country and that they could do anything they wanted to and that what [the applicant and other supporters of the political opposition] were trying to do, meaning the change of the government, was all in vain” (see paragraph 36 above). Furthermore, police officer A.K., while beating him, was asking him “which of the opposition leaders was encouraging his activity” (see paragraph 38 above)."

                "214. The Court notes that there is no objective way to verify the applicant’s allegations. It is true that the circumstances of the applicant’s politically motivated arrest call for strong criticism and raise serious concerns. However, this in itself is not sufficient to conclude that the ill-treatment per se was similarly inflicted for political motives. Judging by the circumstances of the case, it cannot be ruled out that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment as a revenge for the injury that he had inflicted on police officer H.M. Nor can it be ruled out that the violent behaviour of the police officers was triggered by the confrontation between them and the applicant or for reasons of police brutality which are beyond any explanation. While such actions must receive the utmost condemnation and may not be justified or condoned under any circumstances, the Court cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant’s ill-treatment was motivated by his political opinion."

The question of the authorities’ compliance with their procedural obligation is a separate issue, to which the Court will revert below (see Nachova and Others [GC], cited above, § 157, and Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, § 66)."

The Court considers that when investigating violent incidents State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any political motive and to establish whether or not intolerance towards a dissenting political opinion may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating politically induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no political overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 158, 26 February 2004, and Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, § 69)."

The respondent State’s obligation to investigate possible political overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute. The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of politically induced violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others, cited above, § 159, and Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, § 69)."

The Court further considers that the authorities’ duty to investigate the existence of a possible link between political attitudes and an act of violence is an aspect of their procedural obligations arising under Article 3 of the Convention, but may also be seen as implicit in their responsibilities under Article 14 of the Convention to secure the fundamental value enshrined in Article 3 without discrimination. Owing to the interplay of the two provisions, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the two provisions only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both Articles. This is a question to be decided in each case on its facts and depending on the nature of the allegations made (see Nachova and Others [GC], cited above, § 161, and Bekos and Koutropoulos, cited above, § 70)."

Only two police officers, A.M. and R.S., were apparently asked if they were aware of the applicant’s political affiliation, which can hardly be considered to be a real attempt to investigate such a serious allegation and appears to have been a mere formality (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). No further questions were asked, while the remaining police officers, including H.M. and A.K. whom the applicant directly implicated in making politically intolerant statements before and during his ill-treatment, were not even questioned regarding this allegation. No attempts were made to investigate the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest, including the numerous inconsistencies and other elements pointing at the possible politically motivated nature of that measure, and no conclusions were drawn from the available materials. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities failed in their duty under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3 to take all possible steps to investigate whether or not discrimination may have played a role in the applicant’s ill-treatment."
