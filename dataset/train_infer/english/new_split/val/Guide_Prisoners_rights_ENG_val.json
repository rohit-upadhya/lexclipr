                "92. The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. On the other hand, the Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tyrer v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 15, § 30; the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 39, § 100; and V. v. the United Kingdom cited above, § 71)."

Not only had the trial court failed to ensure continuous supervision of his health and of the conditions of his detention but it had taken no notice of the doctors ’ reports on his state either. In particular, he had been held in prison from 11 June to 29 October 1996 even though on the first of those dates the psychiatric expert had assessed his state as very serious and stated that his continued detention had been putting his life at risk. In sum, keeping him in detention regardless of the fact that it could have endangered his life and failing to give him adequate medical assistance amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention."

They had frequently asked the prison services about the applicant ’ s health and, where necessary, inspected the findings of psychiatric examinations or even intervened with a view to improving the situation. For instance, the trial court had immediately reacted to the applicant ’ s complaint about the psychiatric treatment received in prison (which he had made on 7 December 1994 ) and had asked the relevant prison services for an explanation. In addition, the court had on several occasions asked psychiatrists to prepare reports on the applicant ’ s health."

In order to lessen the risk of his absconding again, it had set bail at 10,000 zlotys (PLN), a sum which had been appropriate for the damage caused by the commission of the offences in question but which the applicant had regarded as excessive and had not secured for several months. The delay in his release had therefore been due to the late payment of the required security and had been caused by the applicant himself. The authorities, the Government considered, had displayed due diligence in handling his case and there had been no periods of inertia attributable to their conduct.

From this perspective, the right of an individual to trial within a reasonable time will be less effective if there exists no opportunity to submit the Convention claim first to a national authority; and the requirements of Article 13 are to be seen as reinforcing those of Article 6 § 1, rather than being absorbed by the general obligation imposed by that Article not to subject individuals to inordinate delays in legal proceedings."

He argued in particular that his right to liberty, the deprivation of which was only constitutional if it was in accordance with the law, had been breached by his illegal detention on the basis of a void detention order. The complete refusal to allow his defence counsel access to the case file pursuant to Article 147 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had violated his right to be heard in court, as guaranteed by Article 103 § 1 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 53 below), and his right to liberty under Article 104 § 3 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 54 below). The impugned decisions disregarded both the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Court's case-law as laid down in its judgments of 13 February 2001 in the cases of Garcia Alva, Lietzow v. Germany and Schöps v. Germany. The Court of Appeal's refusal to quash the detention order and its decision to remit the case to the District Court instead had also breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time."

                "48. The consequences of a court's finding in the course of judicial review proceedings that a detention order is flawed will depend on the nature of the defect found. Certain formal defects, in particular a failure to set out in sufficient detail in the order the facts establishing the grounds for strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest, as required by Article 114 § 2 no. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, will make the order defective in law ( rechtsfehlerhaft ), but not void ( unwirksam / nichtig ) (see, inter alia, Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 252/85, decision of 28 November 1985, Neue Zeitschrift für Strafrecht (NStZ) 1986, pp. 134-35; and Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, p. 318 ). Such defects may therefore be remedied by the appeal courts in the course of the judicial review proceedings by either quashing the defective order or replacing it with a fresh, duly reasoned order (compare, inter alia, Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 252/85, decision of 28 November 1985, NStZ 1986, pp. 134-35 with further references; Hamburg Court of Appeal, no. 2 Ws 124/92, decision of 23 March 1992, Monatsschrift für Deutsches Recht ( MDR ) 1992, p. 694; Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, pp. 318-319; and Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 196/00, decision of 26 September 2000, StV 2001, p. 118 ). A defective detention order thus remains a valid basis for detention until the defect is remedied. On the contrary, detention on the basis of a detention order which is void owing to a serious and obvious defect is unlawful (see paragraph 49)."

This is a consequence of the requirements of legal certainty and its corollary, the authority of court decisions, as well as of the overall structure of criminal proceedings with its system of legal remedies designed to correct defective decisions. Considering a court decision ... as legally irrelevant means that anyone may claim that it is null and void at any stage of the proceedings, even after it has become final ... In the case of decisions which can be challenged by an appeal, the statutory rules – formalities and time-limits – become inoperative if the decisions are deemed legally irrelevant. Such consequences, which run counter to the overall order of the law of criminal procedure, may be drawn from the defectiveness of a court decision only, if at all, where it would be unthinkable for the legal community to recognise (at least provisionally ) its validity. This will occur if the extent and gravity of the defect are such that the decision blatantly contradicts the spirit of the Code of Criminal Procedure and key principles of our legal order (see ... ). From the perspective of legal certainty, the assumption that a decision is null and void presupposes, in addition, that the serious defect is obvious” (see Federal Court of Justice, no. 1 BJs 80/78, decision of 16 October 1980, Neue Juristische Wochenschrift ( NJW ) 1981, p. 133 with further references; compare also Federal Court of Justice, no. 1 StR 874/83, decision of 24 January 1984, NStZ 1984, p. 279 )",

As regards the consequences of a finding by a court of appeal, on a further appeal by the detainee, that a detention order is flawed, Article 309 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that if the appeal court considers the appeal against the (continued) detention well-founded, it must take the necessary decision in the case at the same time. The court of appeal thus decides the merits of the case in the lower courts'stead ( see, for instance, Düsseldorf Court of Appeal, no. 4 Ws 222/02, decision of 18 June 2002, NJW 2002, p. 2964 )."

In certain limited circumstances, a case may exceptionally be remitted to the court of first instance if there has been a procedural defect which the court of appeal cannot properly remedy itself (see Brandenburg Court of Appeal, no. 2 Ws 50/96, decision of 17 April 1996, NStZ 1996, pp. 406 - 07; and Düsseldorf Court of Appeal, no. 4 Ws 222/02, decision of 18 June 2002, NJW 2002, pp. 2964 - 65 ). In particular, a court of appeal may remit the case to the district court instead of taking its own decision on the merits if a detention order does not comply with the duty to set out the grounds for suspecting the accused of an offence and if, in addition, the prosecution refused access to the case file. The explanation for this is that, in such cases, the defective reasoning effectively amounts to a breach of the duty to hear representations from the defendant. It was the district court which had jurisdiction to inform the accused for the first time of the grounds for suspecting him of an offence and to hear representations from him (see Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, pp. 318-19). The duty to expedite proceedings in which the suspect is in detention does not warrant a different conclusion as only a remittal of the case will enable him to avail himself effectively of his right to be heard ( see Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, StV 1994, p. 319)."

Poland, no. 28358/95, §§ 51-52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III; Ječius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX; and Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 71, 11 October 2007).",

A period of detention is, in principle, “lawful” if it is based on a court order. A subsequent finding of a superior domestic court that a lower court erred under domestic law in making the order will not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention (see, inter alia, Benham, cited above, § 42; Douiyeb v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 31464/96, § 45, 4 August 1999; Minjat v.

Italy, no. 63154/00, § 78, 4 March 2008 ) or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing ( see Khudoyorov, cited above, § 129; and Liu v. Russia, no. 42086/05, § 79, 6 December 2007 ) – and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court ( ibid. ). A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a “gross and obvious irregularity” in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court's case-law (compare Liu, cited above, § 81; Garabayev v. Russia, no. 38 411/02, § 89, 7 June 2007, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts); and Marturana, cited above, § 79).

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be “lawful” and be effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions “in accordance with the law” and “prescribed by law” in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the “quality of the law”, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. “Quality of the law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996 ‑ III; and Nasrulloyev, cited above, § 71 ).",

                "77. No detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1, the notion of “arbitrariness” in this context extending beyond the lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. It is moreover clear from the case-law that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Saadi, cited above, § § 67- 68 )."
            ],
            [
                "78. One general principle established in the case-law is that detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities ( compare Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, § 59, Series A no. 111; and Saadi, cited above, § 69) or where the domestic authorities neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Benham, cited above, § 47; Liu, cited above, § 82; and Marturana, cited above, § 80)."

                "79. Furthermore, in the context of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1, the reasoning of the decision ordering detention is a relevant factor in determining whether a person's detention must be considered as arbitrary. The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Stašaitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, § 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, § 70, 2 March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § 91, 1 March 2007 ). Conversely, it has found that an applicant's detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 131), unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant's detention (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 157)."

Moreover, the Court has acknowledged notably in the context of sub-paragraphs (c) and (e) of Article 5 § 1 that the speed with which the domestic courts replaced a detention order which had either expired or had been found to be defective is a further relevant element in assessing whether a person's detention must be considered arbitrary. Thus, the Court considered in the context of sub-paragraph (c) that a period of less than a month between the expiry of the initial detention order and the issuing of a fresh, reasoned detention order following a remittal of the case from the appeal court to a lower court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Minjat, cited above, §§ 46 and 48 ). In contrast, a period of more than a year following a remittal from a court of appeal to a court of lower instance, in which the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention on remand, combined with the lack of a time-limit for the lower court to re-examine his detention, was found to render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Khudoyorov, cited above, §§ 136-37 )."

In contrast, a delay of eighty-two days between the expiry of the initial order of detention in a psychiatric institution and its renewal and the lack of adequate safeguards to ensure that the applicant's detention would not be unreasonably delayed was found to be inconsistent with the purpose of Article 5 § 1 to protect individuals from arbitrary detention (see Erkalo, cited above, §§ 57-60 in respect of both sub - paragraphs (a) and (e) of Article 5 § 1 ).",

That order remained in force even after it was found to be flawed on formal grounds on 14 October 2002 as, in the judicial review proceedings, the Court of Appeal only quashed the decisions taken on 16 August 2002 and on 9 September 2002, not the detention order of 25 July 2002 (see paragraph 28 above). On 29 October 2002 the order of 25 July 2002 was replaced by a fresh detention order which contained more detailed reasoning; the applicant has not contested the compliance of that new order with Article 114 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure."

In determining whether the detention order of 25 July 2002 suffered from a “gross and obvious irregularity” so as to be ex facie invalid, which would in turn render the applicant's detention based on that order unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, the Court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the assessment made by the domestic courts. It observes that according to the findings of the German courts, the order in question did not suffer from a serious and obvious defect which rendered it null and void. In fact, the German legal system, like the Convention system, distinguishes between detention orders which are null and void and those which remain valid until overturned by a higher court (see paragraphs 48-49 above). This distinction can equally be found in the legal systems of other Convention States (compare, for instance, the principles of English law laid down in Benham, cited above, §§ 24-26 and 43-46, the Netherlands'legal system as described in Erkalo, cited above, §§ 31-33 and 53-55, and the Swiss legal system explained in Minjat, cited above, §§ 21 and 42-44 ). In the present case, the Court of Appeal considered that the substantive conditions of the applicant's detention were met and that while the formal defects in the detention order of 25 July 2002 – namely the failure to describe in sufficient detail the facts and evidence on which the suspicion and the reasons for the defendant's detention on remand were based as required by Article 114 § 2 no. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – made the order defective in law, they were not so serious as to render it null and void."

The Court further notes that the District Court had jurisdiction to issue the detention order of 25 July 2002 against the applicant and heard representations from the applicant at a hearing before issuing the order and notifying him that it had done so. Furthermore, on the basis of the material before them, all the domestic courts agreed throughout the judicial review proceedings that the substantive conditions for the applicant's detention – a strong suspicion that he had evaded turnover, income and trade taxes and the danger of collusion or of his absconding – were met."

It is true that throughout his detention on the basis of the detention order of 25 July 2002 the applicant's counsel did not have access to the case file and that the Chamber found a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention on that account. However, contrary to the applicant's submission, neither that nor any other breach of Article 5 § 4 – even though that provision is part of domestic law – automatically entails a breach of Article 5 § 1. Paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 5 are separate provisions and the non-observance of the latter thus does not necessarily entail also the non-observance of the former (compare, for instance, Winterwerp, cited above, § 53, and Douiyeb, cited above, § 57 ). Even assuming that a refusal to grant counsel access to the case file in proceedings for the review of his or her client's detention could, when combined with other procedural flaws, lead to a detention order suffering from a “gross and obvious irregularity” within the meaning of the Court's case-law, the Court considers that this was not the position in the applicant's case. Even though the detention order of 25 July 2002 should have been based on more detailed facts according to the provisions of domestic law, the District Court still specified the charges against the applicant. In doing so, it listed the names of the firms that had paid the commission which the applicant had allegedly failed to declare to the tax authorities. It was moreover, clear that the suspicions against the applicant were based on the business records which had been seized at the applicant's home. Therefore, despite the fact that his counsel was not granted access to the case file, the applicant cannot in the circumstances complain that he was not informed at all or was unaware of the basis of the suspicions against him."

In particular, detention orders which do not set out in sufficient detail the facts establishing the grounds for strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest have repeatedly been considered by the domestic courts to be “defective”, but not “void” (see paragraphs 48-49 above).

However, in their case-law, the courts of appeal introduced exceptions to that rule in certain limited circumstances. In particular, in cases – like the present one – in which they considered that the facts on which the suspicion of an offence was based should have been set out in more detail in the detention order and in which the prosecution had refused access to the case file, they decided that exceptionally it would be legitimate and would best serve the interests of justice to remit the case to the district court instead of taking their own decision on the merits (see paragraph 51 above)."

In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the remittal of his case to the court of first instance and his continuous detention at least up to that court's decision was sufficiently foreseeable for the applicant.

It was further clear that the suspicions against the applicant were based on documents that had been seized at the applicant's home so that the applicant was not wholly unaware of the evidence relied upon by the courts (see paragraph 88 above).

Despite the reservations it has expressed above ( see paragraph 9 3 ), the Court considers that remitting a case to a lower court is a recognised technique for establishing in detail the facts and for assessing the evidence relevant to a court's decision and cannot as such be considered arbitrary (compare also Minjat, cited above, §§ 47-48 ). In circumstances such as those obtaining in the present case, the benefits of remitting the case to a lower court may outweigh the inconvenience caused by the delay and may even serve to avoid unnecessary delays. Thus, firstly, remittal can enable the defects of the initial decision to be remedied while taking advantage of the lower court's full command of the case-file along with its more precise knowledge of the suspect's personal situation and of the state of the investigations against him. Moreover, in the case at hand the Court of Appeal did not confine itself to overturning the District Court's decision but instructed it how to avoid defective decisions in the future. This served the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the long run. Secondly, it was necessary to schedule a hearing attended by the applicant ( represented by counsel ), the Public Prosecutor's Office and a tax official in order to enable the applicant to be informed at least orally of the evidence against him and to make representations, and this required practical arrangements to be made. In these circumstances, the decision to remit the case may have actually avoided delays because, from the procedural perspective, it may well have proved quicker for the case to be remitted and for the District Court to decide whether a new detention order should be issued than for the Court of Appeal to decide that issue. Finally, under the domestic law, the District Court's fresh decision was subject to time constraints in that it had to be taken speedily (see paragraph 47 above) and it was that court which, following the remittal, had to arrange for a renewed hearing of the parties. Having regard to its case-law (see, in particular, that cited in paragraph 80 above, and, mutatis mutandis, in paragraph 81 ), the Court finds that in these circumstances, the time that elapsed between the Court of Appeal's finding that the detention order was defective and the issuing of a fresh detention order by the District Court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary either."

In order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given “speedily” has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings were conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (compare Navarra v. France, 23 November 1993, § 28, Series A no. 273 ‑ B ). The question whether the right to a speedy decision has been respected must – as is the case for the “reasonable time” stipulation in Articles 5 § 3 and 6 § 1 of the Convention – be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 84, ECHR 2000-XII; G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, § 33, 30 November 2000; and M.B. v.

Additional proceedings for judicial review of the decision not to grant the applicant's counsel access to the case file under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not therefore have been capable of providing redress in respect of the alleged unlawfulness of the detention order, but only in respect of one aspect of the violation the applicant had complained of. Moreover, the Regional Court, which would have had jurisdiction to hear an application under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had in fact dealt with the applicant's complaint about the refusal of access to the file, and the applicant had also raised this issue before the Federal Constitutional Court in the course of the proceedings for judicial review of the detention order, which he had pursued to a conclusion. The Chamber concluded that in these circumstances, an additional application for judicial review under Article 147 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not have been an effective remedy offering reasonable prospects of success which the applicant was required to exhaust (see paragraphs 83 - 84 of the Chamber judgment)."

The application should have been made expressly and in addition to his request for judicial review of the detention order, as a request under Article 147 § 5 was the only remedy under German law in respect of a prosecution refusal to grant the defence access to the case file.

                "118. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to afford redress for the violation complained of (compare Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 19, Series A no. 32; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 47, ECHR 1999-II; and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000-VII). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress directly in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 1 6 September 1996, § 68, Reports 1996-IV, and Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 156, ECHR 2003-VI). Thus, an applicant cannot be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end as the proceedings the applicant pursued to a conclusion and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (compare Iatridis, cited above, § 47, and Miailhe v. France ( no. 1), 25 February 1993, § 27, Series A no. 256-C)."

The Court notes that the applicant sought judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention order, inter alia, on the grounds that his counsel had not been granted access to the case file. In the course of the judicial review proceedings, the Mönchengladbach Regional Court – which, according to Article 161a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, would have had sole jurisdiction to decide any separate request under Article 147 § 5 of that Code – expressly addressed counsel's request for access to the file. In its decision of 9 September 2002, the Regional Court suggested that counsel for the applicant should be informed orally of the content of the case file in the first instance and could not claim unlimited access at that stage of the proceedings (see paragraph 20 above). The Federal Constitutional Court, which would also have had jurisdiction to review a dismissal by the Regional Court of any separate application expressly made by the applicant under Article 147 § 5, declined to consider the applicant's constitutional complaint about the detention order, in which he had raised the issue of lack of access to the file. In view of this, the Court considers that it can leave open the question whether a separate request under Article 147 § 5 could in general be considered an effective remedy capable of providing redress in cases in which a detainee contests the lawfulness of his detention in the first place. It finds that, in any event, in the particular circumstances of the case, in which the Regional Court expressly addressed and rejected the request for access to the case file in a decision that was upheld by the Federal Constitutional Court, any further, separate application under Article 147 § 5 to those same courts would have been bound to fail."

Likewise, the authorities'proposal to give the applicant's counsel merely an oral account of the facts and of the evidence in the case file had failed to comply with the requirements of “equality of arms”. The fact that the Court of Appeal had later acknowledged that the applicant's procedural rights had been curtailed by the failure to grant his counsel access to the case file and that the domestic authorities had allowed his counsel to inspect the file after his conditional release were incapable of remedying in an effective manner the procedural shortcomings that had occurred in the earlier stages of the proceedings.

The case originated in an application (no. 39630/09) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Khaled El-Masri (“the applicant”), on 20 July 2009.",

                "3. The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been subjected to a secret rendition operation, namely that agents of the respondent State had arrested him, held him incommunicado, questioned and ill-treated him, and handed him over at Skopje Airport to agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who had transferred him, on a special CIA-operated flight, to a CIA-run secret detention facility in Afghanistan, where he had been ill-treated for over four months. The alleged ordeal lasted between 31 December 2003 and 29 May 2004, when the applicant returned to Germany.",
                "4. The application was allocated initially to the Fifth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and this case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).",

The respondent Government accordingly appointed Peer Lorenzen, the judge elected in respect of Denmark, to sit in her place (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).",

On 24 January 2012 a Chamber of the First Section, composed of Nina Vajić, Peer Lorenzen, Elisabeth Steiner, Khanlar Hajiyev, Julia Laffranque, Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos and Erik Møse, judges, assisted by Søren Nielsen, Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).",

In addition, third-party comments were received from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Interights, Redress, the International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3).",

On 31 December 2003 the applicant boarded a bus in Ulm, Germany, with a view to visiting Skopje in order, as he stated, “to take a short vacation and some time off from a stressful home environment”. At around 3 p.m., he arrived at the Serbian/Macedonian border crossing at Tabanovce. A suspicion arose as to the validity of his recently issued German passport. A border official checked his passport and asked him about the purpose of his trip and the length and location of his intended stay. A Macedonian entry stamp dated 31 December 2003 was affixed to his passport. On that occasion, his personal belongings were searched and he was questioned about possible ties with several Islamic organisations and groups. The interrogation ended at 10 p.m. Accompanied by men in civilian clothes who were armed, he was driven to a hotel, which later research indicated was the Skopski Merak Hotel in Skopje (“the hotel”). Upon his return to Germany, the applicant recognised, through photographs available on the hotel’s website, the hotel building, the room where allegedly he had been held and one of the waiters who had served him food during his detention in the hotel.",

Three of them were with him at all times, even when he was sleeping. He was interrogated repeatedly throughout the course of his detention. He was questioned in English despite his limited proficiency in that language. His requests to contact the German embassy were refused. On one occasion, when he stated that he intended to leave, a gun was pointed at his head and he was threatened with being shot. After seven days of confinement, another official arrived and offered him a deal, namely that he would be sent back to Germany in return for a confession that he was a member of al-Qaeda."

The ‘official line’ of the Macedonian Government was first contained in a letter from the Minister of Interior ... to the Ambassador of the European Commission ... dated 27 December 2005. In its simplest form, it essentially contains four items of information ‘according to police records’: first, Mr El-Masri arrived by bus at the Macedonian border crossing of Tabanovce at 4 p.m. on 31 December 2003; second, he was interviewed by ‘authorised police officials’ who suspected ‘possession of a falsified travel document’; third, approximately five hours later, Mr El-Masri ‘was allowed entrance’ into Macedonia, apparently freely; and fourth, on 23 January 2004, he left Macedonia over the border crossing of Blace into Kosovo.",
                "108. The President of the Republic ... set out a firm stance in the very first meeting with the European Parliament delegation, providing a strong disincentive to any official who may have wished to break ranks by expressing an independent viewpoint: ‘Up to this moment, I would like to assure you that I have not come across any reason not to believe the official position of our Ministry of Interior. I have no additional comments or facts, from any side, to convince me that what has been established in the official report of our Ministry is not the truth.’",
                "109. On Friday 28 April the official position was presented in far greater detail during a meeting with ... [the] Head of the UBK, Macedonia’s main intelligence service, at the time of the El-Masri case. [He] stated that the UBK’s Department for Control and Professional Standards had undertaken an investigation into the case and traced official records of all Mr El-Masri’s contact with the Macedonian authorities. The further details as presented by [the Head of the UBK] are summarized as follows:",
                "Mr El-Masri arrived on the Macedonian border on 31 December 2003, New Year’s Eve. The Ministry of Interior had intensified security for the festive period and was operating a higher state of alert around the possible criminal activity. In line with these more intense activities, bus passengers were being subjected to a thorough security check, including an examination of their identity documents.",
                "Upon examining Mr El-Masri’s passport, the Macedonian border police developed certain suspicions and decided to ‘detain him’. In order not to make the other passengers wait at the border, the bus was at this point allowed to continue its journey.",
                "The objective of holding Mr El-Masri was to conduct an interview with him, which (according to [the Head of the UBK]) was carried out in accordance with all applicable European standards. Members of the UBK, the security and counter-intelligence service, are present at all border points in Macedonia as part of what is described as ‘Integrated Border Management and Security’. UBK officials participated in the interview of Mr El-Masri.",
                "The officials enquired into Mr El-Masri’s reasons for travelling into the country, where he intended to stay and whether he was carrying sufficient amounts of money. [The Head of the UBK] explained: ‘I think these were all standard questions that are asked in the context of such a routine procedure – I don’t think I need to go into further details.’",
                "At the same time, Macedonian officials undertook a preliminary visual examination of Mr El-Masri’s travel documents. They suspected that the passport might be faked or forged – noting in particular that Mr El-Masri was born in Kuwait, yet claimed to possess German citizenship.",
                "A further passport check was carried out against an Interpol database. The border point at Tabanovce is not linked to Interpol’s network, so the information had to be transmitted to Skopje, from where an electronic request was made to the central Interpol database in Lyon[s]. A UBK official in the Analytical Department apparently made this request using an electronic code, so the Macedonian authorities can produce no record of it. Mr El-Masri was made to wait on the border point while the Interpol search was carried out.",
                "When it was established that there existed no Interpol warrant against Mr El-Masri and no further grounds on which to hold him, he was released. He then left the border point at Tabanovce, although Macedonian officials were not able to describe how. Asked directly about this point in a separate meeting, the Minister of Interior ... said: ‘we’re not able to tell you exactly what happened to him after he was released because it is not in our interest; after the person leaves the border crossing, we’re not in a position to know how he traveled further.’",
                "The Ministry of Interior subsequently established ... that Mr El-Masri had stayed at a hotel in Skopje called the ‘Skopski Merak’. Mr El-Masri is said to have checked in on the evening of 31 December 2003 and registered in the guest book. He stayed for 23 nights, including daily breakfast, and checked out on 23 January 2004.",

When asked whether Mr El-Masri had received a stamp to indicate his departure by this means, [the Head of the UBK] answered: ‘Normally there should be a stamp on the passport as you cross the border out of Macedonia, but I can’t be sure. UNMIK [United Nations Administration Mission in Kosovo] is also present on the Kosovo border and is in charge of the protocol on that side ... My UBK colleague has just informed me that he has crossed the border at Blace twice in recent times and didn’t receive a stamp on either occasion.’",
                "116. What is not said in the official version is the fact that the Macedonian UBK routinely consults with the CIA on such matters (which, on a certain level, is quite comprehensible and logical). According to confidential information we received (of which we know the source), a full description of Mr El-Masri was transmitted to the CIA via its Bureau Chief in Skopje for an analysis ... did the person in question have contact with terrorist movements, in particular with [al-Qaeda]? Based on the intelligence material about Khaled El-Masri in its possession – the content of which is not known to us – the CIA answered in the affirmative. The UBK, as the local partner organisation, was requested to assist in securing and detaining Mr El-Masri until he could be handed over to the CIA for transfer.”",

Appointed as an adviser to Senator Dick Marty in the context of the Marty Inquiry and a member of the Fava Inquiry, he took part in fact-finding missions in the respondent State, attended meetings with the highest-level officials and contacted sources close to the Government and the intelligence services. He further discussed the applicant’s case with other relevant domestic and foreign government officials and non-governmental representatives. He also interviewed the applicant on several occasions in 2006, as well as other witnesses. At the Open Society Justice Initiative’s request, on 28 March 2011 he submitted an expert report running to sixty-two pages in which he detailed the factual findings of his investigations into the applicant’s case. The report was based on a “considerable amount of original testimonial, documentary and other physical evidence related to the applicant’s case”, most of which was obtained from people who had requested anonymity given the confidential and sensitive nature of the matter. According to the expert, “the Government has classified as ‘Top Secret’ all the documentation in its files that might help to shed light on the case” (see paragraph 21 of the report). He made repeated site visits of the Tabanovce border crossing, the hotel and Skopje Airport and interviewed “witnesses and other sources who participated in or experienced the[se] events at first hand”. In the report, the expert gave detailed information about: the applicant’s arrival in the respondent State; the chronological sequence of events at the Tabanovce border crossing and the actions taken by the Macedonian border officials with respect to the applicant; the UBK’s deployment to Tabanovce and the on-site interrogation of the applicant; the UBK’s liaison with the CIA; and the landing, route and timing of a CIA-operated flight which had been used for the applicant’s transfer from Skopje Airport. As noted in the report, after the arrival of the UBK agents at the Tabanovce border crossing, “the Macedonian authorities took meticulous and wide-ranging measures ... to conceal from scrutiny anything out of the ordinary – including deviations from Macedonian law and procedures – that might happen to Mr El ‑ Masri while held in Macedonian custody. I have been struck by the attention to detail I have learned about on the part of the Macedonian authorities, as they sought to cover up or interfere with almost every avenue of independent investigation into the truth of what happened” (see paragraph 141 of the report).",

As regards the terminology used to refer to irregular transfer and detention of prisoners, the Venice Commission notes that the public debate frequently uses the term ‘rendition’. This is not a term used in international law. The term refers to one State obtaining custody over a person suspected of involvement in serious crime (e.g. terrorism) in the territory of another State and/or the transfer of such a person to custody in the first State’s territory, or a place subject to its jurisdiction, or to a third State. ‘Rendition’ is thus a general term referring more to the result – obtaining of custody over a suspected person – rather than the means. Whether a particular ‘rendition’ is lawful will depend upon the laws of the States concerned and on the applicable rules of international law, in particular human rights law. Thus, even if a particular ‘rendition’ is in accordance with the national law of one of the States involved (which may not forbid or even regulate extraterritorial activities of State organs), it may still be unlawful under the national law of the other State(s). Moreover, a ‘rendition’ may be contrary to customary international law and treaty or customary obligations undertaken by the participating State(s) under human rights law and/or international humanitarian law.",

Indeed, at oral argument, the government advised us that its position would be the same even if the claims were that it was engaging in acts of torture or that it was summarily executing the detainees. To our knowledge, prior to the current detention of prisoners at Guantánamo, the US government has never before asserted such a grave and startling proposition.

The period of four and a half years between his release and the filing of the criminal complaint in October 2008 had not been excessive. On the contrary, that time had been entirely reasonable, considering that this was a complex case of disappearance, involving international intelligence cooperation, in which the US and Macedonian Governments had agreed to cover up the existence of a secret, multinational criminal enterprise. Accordingly, he had acted diligently and in compliance with the Court’s practice. He had sought in timely fashion to initiate a criminal investigation, but the authorities had not responded expeditiously and instead had secretly rejected his complaint. He had further sought in vain information from the public prosecutor about the progress of the investigation.

This concerns not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the Convention, but also procedural provisions; it impacts on the obligations imposed on Governments, but also has effects on the position of applicants. Where time is of the essence in resolving the issues in a case, there is a burden on the applicant to ensure that his or her claims are raised before the Court with the necessary expedition to ensure that they may be properly, and fairly, resolved (see Varnava and Others v.

It sees no reasons that could justify departing from this principle, all the more so in the circumstances of the present case where allegations of inhuman treatment and unlawful deprivation of liberty purportedly are the result of a secret operation carried out without any legal basis. If the actions of the State agents involved have been illegal and arbitrary, it is for the prosecuting authorities of the respondent State to identify and punish the perpetrators.

There were merely some doubts about its effectiveness, and the applicant was required under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention to attempt it before submitting his application to the Court. It would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to bring his complaints to the Court before his position, in connection with the matter, had been finally settled at domestic level in line with the principle of subsidiarity, according to which it is best for the facts of cases to be investigated and issues to be resolved in so far as possible at the domestic level. It is in the interests of the applicant, and the effectiveness of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 164)."

No other legal action in the respondent State was taken by the applicant prior to that date. In accounting for this delay, the applicant gave an explanation which cannot in itself be considered unreasonable. His case concerned allegations of “extraordinary rendition”, which included allegations of abduction, incommunicado detention and ill-treatment. According to the 2006 Marty Report, the authorities of most Council of Europe member States have denied allegations of their participation in rendition operations (see paragraph 43 above). Such policy of obstruction was reaffirmed in the 2007 Marty Report (see paragraph 46 above). Given the sensitivity of the matter and the concealment noted above, it was reasonable for the applicant to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, the inquiries under way in the years prior to October 2008 revealed relevant elements that shed additional light on the applicant’s allegations and constituted a more solid background for his criminal claim. Given the complexity of the case and the nature of the alleged human rights violations at stake, it is understandable that the applicant decided to pursue domestic remedies only when he had some corroborative material available to him."

In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events, the Court is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court. It reiterates that, in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, § 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein)."

The Court reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Rupa v. Romania (no. 1), no. 58478/00, § 97, 16 December 2008).

In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty (see Tanış and Others v.

On that occasion, he had been subjected to brutal and terrifying treatment which had been intentionally designed to induce “capture shock” and break his will for the purpose of subsequent interrogation. The violence used to transfer him to the CIA plane had been out of all proportion to any threat that he had posed, and had been inflicted for the purpose of debasing him or breaking his spirit.

This right was also embodied in Article 13 and woven into Articles 2, 3 and 5 of the Convention. In enforced disappearance cases, the right to the truth was a particularly compelling norm, in view of the mystery surrounding the fate and whereabouts of the victim, irrespective of the eventual reappearance of the victim. Knowing the truth about gross human rights violations and serious violations of humanitarian law afforded victims, their relatives and close friends a measure of satisfaction. The right to the truth inured to the benefit of the direct victims of the violation, as well as to their relatives and to society at large. Rights holders were entitled to seek and obtain information on various issues, namely the identity of the perpetrators, the progress and results of an investigation, and the circumstances and reasons for the perpetration of violations. On the other hand, the right to the truth placed comprehensive obligations on the State, including duties (1) to carry out an effective investigation; (2) to give victims and their relatives effective access to the investigative process; (3) to disclose all relevant information to the victims and the general public; and (4) to protect victims and witnesses from reprisals and threats.

Interights submitted that the present case presented an opportunity for the Court to recognise as impermissible the system of violations which had become known as “extraordinary rendition” and to determine the State’s responsibility under the Convention. The treatment of the rendered persons in preparation for or during the rendition process (including so-called “capture shock” treatment) and the use of coercive interrogation methods might amount to torture and/or ill-treatment. Extraordinary rendition practices inherently involved the removal of a person from one State to another where there was a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Such removal was prohibited by the principle of non-refoulement, which was recognised in the Court’s case-law (Interights referred to Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, and Saadi, cited above). Under the non-refoulement principle, responsibility for complicity, participation or other forms of cooperation in “extraordinary renditions” would arise where the State authorities knew or ought to have known that the violations involved in renditions were being committed. In parallel to the “accomplice liability”, under general international law a State could be held responsible where it rendered aid or assistance to another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act (“accessory responsibility”). The failure to prevent such violations was the most flagrant where the State had given its consent to the acts of foreign agents violating the rights at stake. In addition, acquiescence or connivance in the acts of the foreign agents might engage the State’s responsibility. After the rendition had taken place, the State had an obligation to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into allegations of secret detention and transfer, and to provide reparation, including compensation for non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach."

                "177. Redress stated that an investigation in the context of allegations of extraordinary rendition must be: prompt, independent, thorough and capable of leading to the identification and prosecution of the persons responsible; provide for public scrutiny and victim participation; and afford victims access to information in order to satisfy their right to the truth. The obligation to investigate was incorporated in both Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. National-security considerations could not operate so as to bar a victim from access to such information. If national-security concerns were allowed to prevail over the victim’s right of access to information, the non-derogable and absolute character of Article 3 and the prohibition of unacknowledged detention would be undermined. In this connection it referred to the Council of Europe’s Guidelines of 30 March 2011 on eradicating impunity for serious human rights violations (see paragraph 105 above), according to which “impunity for those responsible for acts amounting to serious human rights violations inflicts additional suffering on victims”. An adequate remedy and reparation must include recognition of, and respect for, the victims of alleged breaches of Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention, so that they, their families and society, as a whole, could know the truth regarding the violations suffered. Besides compensation, other important components which addressed the long-term restorative aims of reparation must also be provided, including satisfaction (acknowledgment of the breach, an expression of regret or a formal apology), guarantees of non-repetition and rehabilitation. In this latter connection, Redress submitted an expert report of 28 March 2011 in which Dr M. Robertson, a chartered clinical psychologist, explained the psychological benefits for the victim of the public disclosure of the truth. According to her, public recognition of the truth and proper acknowledgment through some form of redress could play an integral role in the survivor’s recovery. Conversely, if the truth remained hidden and the perpetrators walked free, that could compound the survivor’s sense of helplessness and struggle to create meaning and obtain closure.",

That system was characterised by the enforced disappearance of individuals, which constituted a violation of the right to freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 3 of the Convention entailed non-refoulement obligations enjoining Contracting Parties from acting – and/or omitting to act – in ways that would result in the removal of any individuals from their jurisdiction when the Contracting Parties knew or ought to have known that their removal would expose them to a real risk of ill-treatment."

His complaints were supported by the evidence which had come to light in the course of the international and other foreign investigations. In the Court’s opinion, the applicant’s description of events and the available material were sufficient to raise at least a reasonable suspicion that the said Convention grievances could have been imputed to the State authorities as indicated by the applicant. He has thus laid the basis of a prima facie case of misconduct on the part of the security forces of the respondent State, which warranted an investigation by the authorities in conformity with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. In any event, the fact that the applicant lodged a formal criminal complaint was not decisive since the information brought to the knowledge of the authorities about serious violations of Article 3 at the time gave rise ipso facto to an obligation under that Article that the State carries out an effective investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26984/05, § 64, 19 April 2012)."

In December 2008, almost two and a half months later, the Skopje public prosecutor rejected the complaint for lack of evidence.

According to the Marty Inquiry, that aircraft had been used in the applicant’s case and had been on a “rendition circuit” involving other detainees transferred under similar circumstances (see paragraph 45 above). Furthermore, the applicant submitted in support of his allegations an official letter in which the Skopje Airport authorities had attested that the aircraft had landed at Skopje Airport on 23 January 2004 without any passengers and that it had taken off the next morning carrying only one passenger (see paragraph 67 above). The applicant’s allegations regarding his transfer to Afghanistan, both in terms of time and manner, were strikingly consistent with the actual course of that aircraft. However, the investigating authorities remained passive and decided not to follow up on that lead. It is surprising that they took no notice of that information and failed to investigate the identity of the passenger who had boarded the aircraft that night.

In this connection it underlines the great importance of the present case not only for the applicant and his family, but also for other victims of similar crimes and the general public, who had the right to know what had happened. The issue of “extraordinary rendition” attracted worldwide attention and triggered inquiries by many international and intergovernmental organisations, including the United Nations human rights bodies, the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. The latter revealed that some of the States concerned were not interested in seeing the truth come out. The concept of “State secrets” has often been invoked to obstruct the search for the truth (see paragraphs 46 and 103 above). State secret privilege was also asserted by the US government in the applicant’s case before the US courts (see paragraph 63 above).

The Court does not underestimate the undeniable complexity of the circumstances surrounding the present case. However, while there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, an adequate response by the authorities in investigating allegations of serious human rights violations, as in the present case, may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory (see Anguelova v.

He was placed in an adult nappy and dressed in a dark blue short-sleeved tracksuit. Shackled and hooded, and subjected to total sensory deprivation, the applicant was forcibly marched to a CIA aircraft (a Boeing 737 with the tail number N313P), which was surrounded by Macedonian security agents who formed a cordon around the plane. When on the plane, he was thrown to the floor, chained down and forcibly tranquillised. While in that position, the applicant was flown to Kabul (Afghanistan) via Baghdad (Iraq).

Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise.

Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists submitted that where an act or omission of a Contracting Party, taking place within its jurisdiction, had a direct causal connection with a rendition involving a continuing violation of Convention rights, taking place partly on its territory and partly elsewhere, both the State’s negative and positive Convention obligations were engaged.

It is for that reason that the Court has repeatedly stressed in its case-law that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Chahal, cited above, § 118). This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 § 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (see Quinn v.

The requirements of Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptness and judicial supervision assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Aksoy, cited above, § 76).

In such circumstances, the Court considers that it should have been clear to the Macedonian authorities that, having been handed over into the custody of the US authorities, the applicant faced a real risk of a flagrant violation of his rights under Article 5. In this connection the Court reiterates that Article 5 of the Convention lays down an obligation on the State not only to refrain from active infringements of the rights in question, but also to take appropriate steps to provide protection against an unlawful interference with those rights to everyone within its jurisdiction (see Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, §§ 100-01, ECHR 2005 ‑ V, and Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, § 123, 15 January 2009). The Macedonian authorities not only failed to comply with their positive obligation to protect the applicant from being detained in contravention of Article 5 of the Convention, but they actively facilitated his subsequent detention in Afghanistan by handing him over to the CIA, despite the fact that they were aware or ought to have been aware of the risk of that transfer. The Court considers therefore that the responsibility of the respondent State is also engaged in respect of the applicant’s detention between 23 January and 28 May 2004 (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § 207, ECHR 2010)."

                "240. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the applicant’s abduction and detention amounted to “enforced disappearance” as defined in international law (see paragraphs 95 and 100 above). The applicant’s “enforced disappearance”, although temporary, was characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability, which extended through the entire period of his captivity (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 148). In this connection the Court would point out that in the case of a series of wrongful acts or omissions, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the acts and continuing for as long as the acts or omissions are repeated and remain at variance with the international obligation concerned (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 321, and see also paragraph 97 above)."

The Court further recognises that these aspects of the concept extend to situations of deprivation of liberty (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 63, Reports 1997 ‑ VIII). Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. A person should not be treated in a way that causes a loss of dignity, as “the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom” (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, §§ 61 and 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ III). Furthermore, the mutual enjoyment by members of a family of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, § 59, Series A no. 130).

                "255. The Court observes that Article 13 guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State. Where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been ill-treated by agents of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy” entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see Anguelova, cited above, §§ 161-62; Assenov and Others, cited above, §§ 114 et seq.; Süheyla Aydın v.

Turkey, no. 40035/98, § 50, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII). This scrutiny must be carried out without regard to what the person may have done to warrant expulsion or to any perceived threat to the national security of the expelling State (see Chahal, cited above, § 151).",

The Court has already found the respondent State responsible for violations of the applicant’s rights under Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention. His complaints under these Articles are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, § 52, Series A no. 131)."

However, the “lawfulness” of detention under domestic law is not always the decisive element.

In this connection, the Court notes that it may happen that a Contracting State ’ s agents conduct themselves unlawfully in good faith. However, even if there has been no fault on the part of the officials, it should be stressed that the Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of any State agency since what is in issue in all cases before the Court is the international responsibility of the State ( Lukanov v.

The initial failure of the Borovichi Police to verify the existence of a valid arrest warrant prior to placing the applicant ’ s name on the federal list of wanted persons was further aggravated by the Novgorod Police ’ s omission to report the fact that the criminal proceedings had been discontinued promptly. It is surprising that the federal departments of the Ministry of the Interior should have been so slow to update the police database and failed to act for several months. A cause for further concern is the fact that the Moscow Police and the Prosecutor ’ s Office failed to react with the special diligence called for in such situations to the applicant ’ s complaint about his unlawful arrest in June 2000 and thus permitted the rearrest of a person who was known to be innocent."

That fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, as it has been the Court ’ s traditional view that the unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of the fundamentally important guarantees contained in Article 5 of the Convention and discloses a most grave violation of that provision. The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention ( Anguelova v.

However, it notes that the Government have not argued that at any point in time did any relevant authority visit the applicant, verify that she was not in fact alone following her parents’ arrest, inform her about her parents’ situation, clarify her own situation to her, or – given her age – take her to visit either or both of them in prison."

They submitted that it was plausible that the applicant’s parents would have had a circle of friends and acquaintances to whom their daughter could have turned in their absence. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant’s parents’ own lawyer had been present during the hearing on extending their detention and had stated during the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant that he did not know what had happened to her. Similarly, the applicant’s teacher had testified that she had no memory of the applicant having been hungry, cold or distressed at the time (see paragraph 35 above). Finally, the Government submitted that the applicant’s mother could have alerted the authorities to her daughter’s situation while she had been in prison and that she could have asked that the record of the court hearing be corrected in respect of the availability of care to the applicant."

The applicant’s parents were educated persons from a prominent background with high-level professional experience, were apparently of means and not lacking in skills, and cared for their daughter (see paragraphs 8, 9, 18 and 25 above). They were legally represented during the extradition proceedings by a lawyer of their own choosing. That lawyer had taken part in the court hearing when the judge had enquired into the applicant’s care in the absence of her parents (see paragraph 17 above); he had continued to represent the applicant’s parents throughout their subsequent detention and had, moreover, been a neighbour to the applicant’s family (ibid.). Furthermore, in addition to being recorded as stating in court that there was someone to care for her daughter, the applicant’s mother did not at any point in time – either before or after that hearing, at the time of her arrest or later from prison – raise with any authority the question of the applicant’s care during her detention. Neither did her father, who had been arrested at the same time and together with the mother, notify any authority at any point in time that his daughter had been left alone or that he had any concerns about her care in his absence."

In the circumstances, the Court finds that the competent authorities had no reason to assume, or suspect, after the court hearing on 6 December 2002 that the applicant had been left alone and not provided for in her parents’ absence. Consequently, their obligation under domestic law to take detained persons’ children into care, if no care was available to them, was not relevant after the hearing on 6 December 2002. Accordingly, in the absence of any steps by or on behalf of the parents at the time of the events, the Court finds that, in the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant, the domestic courts’ reliance on the record of the detention hearing and their conclusion that neither the police, nor the prosecution, nor the courts had needed to enquire any further about the applicant’s situation did not amount to a failure to act appropriately in the context of their Article 8 obligations."

It appears from the documents before the domestic courts that at that time, the parents were out shopping accompanied by their legal representative, who returned home with them.

We came here so that my children could study in Varna, in a democratic country, because Turkmenistan is a dictatorship; a fascist regime has begun. There is someone to take care of my child.” According to the court record of the hearing, the mother’s statement had been preceded by an intervention by the prosecutor, who had indicated that it was necessary to comply with the requirements of Article 152 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so that if the family had no relatives or friends to care for the child, the municipality had to be informed with a view to placing her in a child-care centre, kindergarten or boarding facility ( интернат ).",

Furthermore, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). The Court has also held that the cumulative effect of the domestic authorities’ failure to adopt measures, including but not limited to interim court measures, as required in a situation which adversely affected the applicants amounted to a failure to assist them, in breach of the State’s positive obligations under Article 8 to secure respect for their private and family life (see Bevacqua and S., cited above, § 84). The Court has also found, albeit in the context of a complaint made under Article 3 of the Convention, that the failure of the authorities to organise care for an applicant, who was aged twelve when his parents were arrested and held at a police station for several hours, or to explain the situation to him, reached the threshold required by Article 3 and constituted degrading treatment (see Ioan Pop and Others v.

In the Court’s view, the relevant domestic legal provisions (see paragraphs 44-46 above) were designed to protect children but there is nothing to suggest that they were applied in the present case. In particular, the Government have not demonstrated that, at the time of the arrest, the police notified the relevant authorities that the applicant’s parents were being taken into custody and that she was being left unattended. As is apparent from the Government’s observations, the first time an authority enquired into whether the child had a carer was during the court hearing which took place two days later."

Consequently, the authorities had a responsibility either to place the applicant’s parents in a position to arrange for her care at the time they were taken into custody, or to enquire into the applicant’s situation of their own motion. Once the authorities had established the circumstances relating to the applicant’s care in her parents’ absence, if it appeared necessary, they had an obligation under domestic law to provide her with assistance, support and services as needed, either in her own home, in a foster family or at a specialised institution. This obligation, pursuant to domestic law, appeared to arise from the moment her parents were taken into custody (see paragraphs 45-46 above). The Government have not submitted that any of this was done by the relevant authorities at any point in time before the hearing on 6 December 2002, which was two days after the arrest of the applicant’s parents. The Court thus finds that, as regards the period between the applicant’s parents’ arrest and the hearing on extending their detention, the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to act in order to ensure that the applicant, who was a minor left without parental care, was protected and provided for in her parents’ absence."

The Court considers that it is not its task to specify which authority could have done what exactly and when in order to prevent the applicant’s potential exposure to suffering provoked by the uncertainty about her own fate and that of her parents after their arrest. However, it notes that the Government have not argued that at any point in time did any relevant authority visit the applicant, verify that she was not in fact alone following her parents’ arrest, inform her about her parents’ situation, clarify her own situation to her, or – given her age – take her to visit either or both of them in prison."

In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant’s parents’ own lawyer had been present during the hearing on extending their detention and had stated during the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant that he did not know what had happened to her. Similarly, the applicant’s teacher had testified that she had no memory of the applicant having been hungry, cold or distressed at the time (see paragraph 35 above).

The applicant’s parents were educated persons from a prominent background with high-level professional experience, were apparently of means and not lacking in skills, and cared for their daughter (see paragraphs 8, 9, 18 and 25 above). They were legally represented during the extradition proceedings by a lawyer of their own choosing. That lawyer had taken part in the court hearing when the judge had enquired into the applicant’s care in the absence of her parents (see paragraph 17 above); he had continued to represent the applicant’s parents throughout their subsequent detention and had, moreover, been a neighbour to the applicant’s family (ibid.). Furthermore, in addition to being recorded as stating in court that there was someone to care for her daughter, the applicant’s mother did not at any point in time – either before or after that hearing, at the time of her arrest or later from prison – raise with any authority the question of the applicant’s care during her detention.

Accordingly, in the absence of any steps by or on behalf of the parents at the time of the events, the Court finds that, in the subsequent proceedings for damages brought by the applicant, the domestic courts’ reliance on the record of the detention hearing and their conclusion that neither the police, nor the prosecution, nor the courts had needed to enquire any further about the applicant’s situation did not amount to a failure to act appropriately in the context of their Article 8 obligations."

The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.

The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored and that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above, in particular Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector).

                "36. The Government did not dispute the fact that the Law of 9 March 2004 had not come into force either when the offence had been committed or when the applicant had been convicted. Nevertheless, they argued that the measure complained of did not constitute a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7. They sought to demonstrate this by referring to the criteria established by the Court ’ s case-law, in particular in Welch v. the United Kingdom ( 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A ) and Jamil v. France ( 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B ). While the Court had found, in Jamil, that imprisonment in default was a penalty, on the ground that “[t]he sanction imposed on Mr Jamil was ordered by a criminal court, was intended to be deterrent and could have led to a punitive deprivation of liberty” (§ 32), it had also ruled that special supervision was not comparable to a criminal sanction since it was designed to prevent the commission of offences ( they referred to Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 43, Series A no. 281 ‑ A ). In the Government ’ s submission, that was precisely the aim of security measures including placement on the Sex Offenders Register. They could be defined as social protection measures designed to prevent persons from reoffending or to remove a source of danger. They were based not on the offender ’ s guilt but on the danger he or she represented. Hence, placement on the Sex Offenders Register was carried out “as a security measure” (Article 706-53-5 of the CCP) and was not a sanction. Point 4 of Article 706-53-2 of the CCP provided for a person ’ s details to be entered in the register even where a decision had been given discontinuing the proceedings or discharging or acquitting the person concerned on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code, according to which “persons who, at the time of the offence, were suffering from a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric disorder which deprived them of the ability to discern or control their actions [were] not criminally liable”."

The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting ‑ point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “ criminal offence ”. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the characterisation of the measure in question under national law; its nature and purpose; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, §§ 27 and 28)."

In that regard, it considers that the fact that a convicted offender ’ s address is known to the police or gendarmerie and the judicial authorities by virtue of his or her inclusion in the Sex Offenders Register constitutes a deterrent and facilitates police investigations.

Lastly, the Government submitted that society ’ s interest in the prevention of sexual offences had to be weighed against the seriousness of the infringement of the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. In their view, the establishment of the Sex Offenders Register was part of the gradual introduction of a specific set of rules governing sexual offences, which was justified by the comparatively recent increase in awareness concerning the special character of such offences. The latter stemmed from the fact that these offenders often had personality disorders, which were a real factor in reoffending, and from the particular suffering caused to the victims, especially if they were minors at the time of the offence. Hence, the national authorities had put in place a combination of punitive and preventive measures. The establishment of the Sex Offenders Register in that connection had been aimed at filling gaps in the system of prevention in relation to the particularly serious category of sexual offences. The Government added that it was clear from the Court ’ s case-law that the Court did not dispute States ’ right, in seeking to prevent offending, to gather and store personal data provided that “ there exist [ed] adequate and effective guarantees against abuse ” ( they referred to Leander v.

As to the other guarantees provided for by the law, the Government pointed out that the length of time for which the information was kept (twenty or thirty years) depended on the seriousness of the offence. This was a maximum period, and the persons concerned could request the deletion from the register of the information concerning them. The request could be made to three authorities: the public prosecutor, the liberties and detention judge and the President of the Investigation Division. This three ‑ pronged approach constituted a triple guarantee. In the instant case, the fact that the applicant ’ s conviction was entered in his criminal record made any request for deletion of the information in the Sex Offenders Register inadmissible. However, the applicant had the option of applying for judicial rehabilitation, which would wipe the conviction from the criminal records. Moreover, the Sex Offenders Register could be consulted only by certain authorities that were bound by a duty of confidentiality, and in precisely defined circumstances.

By Resolution no. 540 of 5 September 2006, the Russian Government approved a federal expenditure programme under the title “Development of the Criminal Justice and Penitentiary System in 2007-2016”. As amended by subsequent Government Resolutions, the programme description reads as follows:",
                "“The contemporary criminal justice and penitentiary system is a complex of institutions and organs that enforces various types of penalties. It comprises 1,060 institutions, including 844 correctional facilities, 7 prisons and 209 remand prisons. At present more than 812,000 individuals are being held in those institutions.",
                "The number of suspects and defendants who were remanded in custody and are held in remand prisons (hereinafter – “untried prisoners”) and the number of convicted defendants in correctional facilities (hereinafter – “convicted prisoners”) do not depend on the functioning of the Federal Penitentiary Service and are chiefly determined by the level of crime in the country and the judicial practice.",
                "Pursuant to the requirements of the Russian Federation’s laws, untried and convicted prisoners must be allocated to cells, taking into account their character and psychological compatibility, as well as their gender and age... The sanitary norm is four square metres of floor space per untried prisoner.",
                "As a consequence of construction and renovation work carried out in remand prisons in the framework of the federal expenditure programme ‘Reform of the penitentiary system in 2002-2006’, the number of places in remand prisons in which the conditions of detention are compatible with the requirements of Russian laws will reach 94.4% by the end of 2006. The federal expenditure programme ‘Development of the Criminal Justice and Penitentiary System in 2007-2016’ (hereinafter – “the Programme”) will be a logical continuation of this work.",
                "At present only the facilities in forty Russian regions are actually capable of providing accommodation that is compatible with the sanitary norm of floor space per inmate. It follows that the remand prison population exceeds the established prison capacity, and in certain regions it does so to a significant extent. In twenty Russian regions the sanitary norm of cell surface per detainee is less than four square metres, in eighteen regions (Altay, Tyva, Sakha (Yakutiya), Chuvash and Udmurt Republics, Krasnodar, Perm, Khabarovsk, Astrakhan, Kaluga, Kostroma, Kurgan, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Smolensk, Tomsk and Tula Regions) it is less than three square metres, which is a violation of the rights of untried prisoners.",

In recent years, constructions have collapsed in remand prisons of the Astrakhan, Magadan, Moscow, Tambov, Chita and other regions owing to their unsatisfactory condition. It is now being debated whether twelve remand prisons (Dagestan, Karelia and Chuvash Republics, Astrakhan, Belgorod, Vologda, Voronezh, Kamchatka, Kostroma, Sverdlovsk, Tambov and Tula Regions) should be put out of operation...",

Taking into account the fact that the minimum sanitary norm per detainee is set by the [Committee for the Prevention of Torture, “CPT”] at seven square metres, the European Court refers in its judgments to this approximate standard for prisoners’ accommodation. The Council of Europe’s commentary on the European Prison Rules gives reasons to believe that the [CPT] will set the sanitary norm per inmate in the range of nine or ten square metres.",
                "At present the sanitary norm per inmate meets the international standard only in three remand prisons (Dagestan and Kalmykiya Republics, Kamchatka Region); however, two of them (Dagestan and Kamchatka) are under threat of collapse and will have to be closed...",

Starting from 2010, the conditions of detention in ninety-seven old-style remand prisons will be brought into compliance with Russian laws.

The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions... Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

The CPT fully accepts that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners...

The Supreme Court reiterated that the right to be detained in conditions respecting one’s dignity belonged to the catalogue of personal rights and that the State treasury should be liable for an infringement of such rights. It determined that the prison authorities had failed to show the existence of a “particularly justified case” for placement of detainees in an already overcrowded facility and in that way had acted unlawfully."

It re-examined the applicants’ situation in the light of the above-mentioned developments at domestic level and found that the Supreme Court’s judgment of 17 March 2010 constituted a material element which was indispensable for the consolidation of the previous practice of civil courts in cases concerning claims for compensation on account of prison overcrowding ( Łatak, § 80). Accordingly, the applicants were required to seek redress at domestic level and bring a civil action for compensation before Polish courts ( ibid ., § 81) and their applications to the Court were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (§ 82). The Court also noted that the amended Article 110 § 2 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences provided detainees with a new legal means for contesting the governor’s decision to reduce the available cell space.

The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, § 73, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006)."
            ],
            [
                "76. An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v. Russia, no. 12008/03, §§ 40-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, § 36, and Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, § 33, 19 June 2008)."

As long as the applicant stays within the same type of detention facility, and provided the material conditions have remained substantially the same, it matters not that he or she was transferred between cells or wings within the same remand prison (see Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, §§ 108-109, 16 December 2010, and Nazarov v. Russia, no. 13591/05, § 78, 26 November 2009), from one remand prison to another within the same region (see Romokhov v.

Russia, no. 14797/02, § 67, 8 July 2010, and Buzhinayev v. Russia, no. 17679/03, § 23, 15 October 2009). Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the “continuous situation” as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing."

The Court’s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant’s detention may therefore be summarised in the following manner: a period of an applicant’s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion."

The Government explained that the Supreme Court had prepared the text of a ruling governing the application of preventive measures, including those of a custodial nature, in which it clarified that placement in custody should be applied only if a less restrictive preventive measure was not an available option (see paragraph 52 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office had directed the prosecutors to specify, in each application for a detention order, the concrete circumstances which made it impossible to use less restrictive preventive measures.

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

France, 20 February 1991, § 27, Series A no. 198, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, § 22, Series A no. 112). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement."

Accordingly, it has recognised that the rule of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 157-158, and Wasserman v.

Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. In contrast to the cases concerning the length of judicial proceedings or non-enforcement of judgments, where the Court accepted in principle that a compensatory remedy alone might suffice (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 187, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 99, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...), the existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court’s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weakened the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements."

On that basis, it has rejected the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has held in particular that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant’s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant’s personal situation alone (see, among recent authorities, Kozhokar v. Russia, no. 33099/08, §§ 92-93, 16 December 2010; Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, §§ 43-44, 7 October 2010; Vladimir Krivonosov v.

Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to review those findings in the light of the situation in the Russian legal system both on the date of the submission of the individual applications in the instant case and on the date of the present judgment. In doing so, it will depart from its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, but rather make a global assessment of the remedies available in the domestic legal system that appear prima facie capable of offering either preventive or compensatory relief to the aggrieved individual.",

During these inspections they had identified 1,330 and 2,491 cases of inadequate detention conditions, respectively, and issued 1,998 and 1,335 reports requiring the prison authorities to eliminate the violations.

Even though the prosecutors’ control undeniably plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court’s case-law (see, for instance, Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, §§ 88-89, 1 April 2010; Aleksandr Makarov, § 86, and Benediktov, § 29, both cited above). Pursuant to section 17 § 7 of the Pre-trial Detention Act, detainees may send their complaints to a prosecutor. However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings that would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v. Russia, no. 22107/03, § 55, 29 January 2009).

Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, § 84, with further references)."

Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). While their activities may usefully contribute to general improvement of conditions of detention, the ombudsmen remain unable, in view of their specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention.

The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above)."

In the context of another structural problem in Russia, that of non-enforcement of final judicial decisions, the Court has already observed that the Russian courts’ capacity to order remedial action under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was essentially restricted to the issuing of a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any case evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to pay for its debts (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 103). In the instant case, as the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees.

The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules)."

                "116. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79)."

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII; Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 26, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII; and Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 168)."

                "122. The Court is mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by the applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about the conditions of their detention. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government."

It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant’s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant’s allegations (see Gubin v.

In this connection the Court noted that the destruction of the relevant documents did not absolve the Government from the obligation to support their factual submissions with appropriate evidence.

As regards access to toilets, the Court has noted in many cases that in Russian remand prisons the lavatory pan was placed in the corner of the cell and either lacked any separation from the living area or was separated by a single partition approximately one to one a half metres high. Such close proximity and exposure was not only objectionable from a hygiene perspective but also deprived a detainee using the toilet of any privacy because he remained at all times in full view of other inmates sitting on the bunks and also of warders looking through the peephole (see, among other authorities, Aleksandr Makarov, § 97, Trepashkin, § 94, Grishin, § 94, and Kalashnikov, § 99, all cited above). In one case the Court considered that the lack of privacy resulting from the openness of the toilet area must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medication in front of his cellmates and warders (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 124)."

Indeed, the Court’s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v.

It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout Russia (compare Broniowski, § 189, and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above)."

In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities’ normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions – the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions – the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (§§ 204-210 of the report)."

The Programme expressly referred to Russia’s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme’s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016.

It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government’s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 134)."

Some of them – such as the insufficient number of remand prisons, their antiquity and poor state of repair, misallocation of resources, and a lack of transparency in prison management – may be traced back to the penitentiary system, whereas others – such as the excessive and often unjustified recourse to detention on remand, rather than alternative preventive measures, or a lack of efficient remedies to ensure that the conditions comply with the Russian legislation – have originated elsewhere.",

In the period from 2002 to 2006, a federal programme for reforming prisons permitted renovation and reconstruction of a number of remand centres and resulted in a tangible increase in the number of places and floor space per inmate. It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space.

While the pilot-judgment procedure has been instrumental in helping Contracting States to comply with their obligations under the Convention, the Court does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to involve itself in reforms of that type in parallel with the Committee of Ministers or to order a specific general measure to be adopted in that process by the respondent State. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Russia to ensure adequate conditions of pre-trial detention in accordance with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Finger, cited above, § 115; Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 136 and 137; and Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v.

Thus, the Court considers it important for the purposes of the present judgment to highlight two such issues which need inevitably to be addressed by the Russian authorities in their ongoing struggle against persistent overcrowding of remand centres. The first issue concerns the close affinity between the problem of overcrowding, which falls to be considered under Article 3 of the Convention, and an excessive length of pre-trial detention, which has been found by the Court to violate another provision of the Convention, namely Article 5, in an equally significant number of Russian cases. The second issue, which is closely linked to the first, concerns possible additional ways of combating the overcrowding through provisional arrangements and safeguards for the admission of prisoners in excess of the prison capacity.",

It has been the constant and common position of all Council of Europe bodies that a reduction in the number of remand prisoners would be the most appropriate solution to the problem of overcrowding. The Court has reiterated in many of its judgments that, in view of both the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of liberty, remand in custody must be the exception rather than the norm and only a measure of last resort (see, among many others, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ X). The Committee for the Prevention of Torture considered that in the context of high incarceration rates, such as those persisting in Russia, “throwing increasing amounts of money at the prison estate will not offer a solution” (see paragraph 28 of the 11th General Report, CPT/Inf(2001)16), and has advocated active review of pre-trial custody policy. As recently as in 2010 the Committee of Ministers indicated that “the creation of new places of detention cannot in itself provide a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding and that this measure should be closely supported by others aimed at reducing the overall number of remand prisoners” (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, and also point I(2) of the Appendix to Recommendation R(99)22, cited in paragraph 57 above)."

The statistical information from the Russian judicial system demonstrates a substantial reduction in the number of initial applications for a detention order, down approximately thirty-four per cent in 2010 as compared to 2007 (see paragraph 53 above). The number of applications for an extension order also diminished but in a much less perceptible manner, only by some eight per cent in the same four-year period. A decreasing number of applications for initial detention orders may be interpreted as a consequence of the recent steps towards decriminalising certain non-violent offences and also as an indication of a more reserved approach on the part of investigative authorities to using custody as a preventive measure at the pre-trial stage. Even though the number of requests by the prosecutors has decreased in relative terms, the absolute number still appears to be much too high."

What seems to be a reason for concern is that in the same time period the percentage of applications for a detention order granted by courts has remained at a constant and inordinately high level and has never varied despite a decreasing global number of such applications. Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor’s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody. The statistics for the year 2010 did not show any visible change in the judicial practice and the percentage of rejected applications for detention or extension orders increased by less than 0.2 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that on 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted a special ruling (see paragraph 52 above) by which it reminded the courts that detention on remand should only be ordered if other preventive measures could not be applied."

The Court, for its part, has already identified a malfunctioning of the Russian judicial system on account of excessively lengthy detention on remand without proper justification. Starting with the Kalashnikov judgment in 2002, the Court has to date found a violation of the obligation to guarantee a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, in more than eighty cases against Russia where the domestic courts extended an applicant’s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and employing the same stereotyped formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see, among many other authorities, Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, §§ 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Mamedova, cited above, §§ 72 et seq.; Dolgova v.

Unjustified and excessive recourse to custodial measures at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings has also been pinpointed by the Committee of Ministers as a structural problem in Russia. Its existence has been confirmed by the continuous flow of new similar applications to the Court and by the data available at national level and it has been closely linked with the problem of overcrowding in pre-trial detention centres (see points 3 and 4 of the Memorandum “Detention on remand in the Russian Federation: Measures required to comply with the European Court’s judgments” prepared by the Department of the Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights CM/InfDH(2007)4 of 12 February 2007, and Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above). The Committee of Ministers noted the repeated statements by the Russian President and high-ranking State officials, including the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice, to the effect that up to thirty per cent of individuals held in custody should not have been deprived of their liberty, having been suspected or accused of offences of low or medium gravity, and welcomed the unambiguous commitment at the highest political level to change this unacceptable situation and to adopt urgent legislative and other measures to that effect (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above)."

The Court welcomes the steps that have already been taken by the Russian authorities to reduce the number of individuals remanded in custody at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings. It reiterates that Russian prosecutors should be formally encouraged to decrease the number of applications for detention orders, except in the most serious cases involving violent offences. However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 § 3 in the Court’s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers’ assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 3. In addition to the Committee of Ministers’ conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v.

The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al ., § 69, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, § 40, 23 September 2010).

It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population.

Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 104).

                "225. Second, the courts must acknowledge the violation of Article 3 in a sufficiently clear way and afford redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner. Without a specific explanation in the domestic courts’ judgments as to the extent to which the finding and acknowledgement of a violation of Article 3 entailed a reduction of the sentence, the mitigation of the sentence would not deprive, on its own, the aggrieved individual of his status as a victim of the violation (see Dzelili, cited above, § 85). This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment. Besides, it should be taken into account that an automatic reduction of sentence for convicted criminals on account of their previous stay in substandard detention facilities may adversely affect the public interest of criminal punishment (see Dimitrov and Hamanov v. Bulgaria, nos. 48059/06 and 2708/09, § 129, 10 May 2011)."

Finally, it is also clear that while an automatic mitigation of sentence on account of inhuman conditions of detention may be considered as a part of a wide array of general measures to be taken, it will not provide on its own a definitive solution to the existing problem of deficient remedies nor contribute, to a decisive extent, to eradication of genuine causes of overcrowding, namely the excessive use of custodial measures at the pre-trial stage and poor material conditions of detention."

As regards the possibility of obtaining monetary compensation for a violation of Article 3, in the light of the Court’s conclusions set out in paragraphs 113-118 above, it appears unlikely that an effective compensatory remedy can become operational without changing the provisions of the domestic legislation on certain crucial points (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 138). For the sake of clarity and given the importance of the matter, the Court finds it appropriate to provide guidance to the Government, in order to assist them in the performance of their duty under Article 46 § 1 of the Convention."

Monetary compensation should be accessible to anyone who has been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and who has made an application to that effect. The Court emphasises that the burden of proof imposed on the claimant in compensation proceedings should not be excessive. He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125)."

The finding of an incompatibility of the conditions of detention with the requirements of Article 3, on the basis of the criteria outlined in paragraphs 143-158 above, is of a factual nature and creates a strong legal presumption that such conditions have occasioned non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved individual. The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. As the Court repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see, among others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, § 87, and Mamedova, § 63, both cited above)."

The principles outlined by the Court in paragraph 172 above may serve as guidance for the Russian authorities in determining the amount of compensation. The right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is so fundamental and central to the system of the protection of human rights that the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to provide exceptionally compelling and serious reasons to justify their decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (compare Finger, cited above, § 130)."

It is not the Court’s task to specify what would be the most appropriate way to set up the necessary remedies. The State may either amend the existing range of legal remedies or add new remedies to secure genuinely effective redress for the violation of the Convention rights concerned in the light of the Court’s findings and recommendations set out above. It is also for the State to ensure, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, that such combination of remedies respects both in theory and in practice the requirements of the Convention as set out in this judgment (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 140)."

The Court is convinced that a reasonable time-limit must be fixed for the adoption of the measures, given the importance and urgency of the matter and the fundamental nature of the right which is at stake. Nonetheless, it does not find it appropriate’ to indicate a specific time frame for the introduction of a combination of preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of alleged violations of Article 3, involving as it does the preparation of draft laws, amendments and regulations, then their enactment and implementation, together with the provision of appropriate training for the State officials concerned.

Rule 61 § 6 of the Rules of Court provides for the possibility of adjourning the examination of all similar applications pending the implementation of the remedial measures by the respondent State.

An accelerated settlement of the individual cases at the domestic level is not only required because of the gravity of the applicants’ allegations under Article 3, a provision of fundamental importance in the Convention system. The need for such a settlement is also dictated by the principle of subsidiarity: once the Court has clarified the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention, it is in principle for the latter to take the necessary remedial measures, so that the Court does not have to reiterate its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases."

The Court further observes that the first applicant ’ s allegation about insufficient and poor quality food in the SIZO is confirmed by the statements of her fellow detainee ( see paragraph 48 above). The fact that her mother sent her about thirty parcels, often with the most basic foodstuffs, is another indication that such food was not provided to the first applicant by the SIZO administration ( see paragraph 43 above). The Court has already held that where food given to an applicant is clearly insufficient, this in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention ( see Kadiķis v.

As compared to ordinary detainees who are entitled to one-hour daily walk, women with children may have the duration of their outdoor walks extended “up to two hours”. In other words, the failure to grant such an extension or a very insignificant extension would not appear to contravene that requirement."

Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 116, 29 November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept of the detainee ’ s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention (see, for example, Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 83, ECHR 2006 - XII), that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate ( see Hummatov, cited above, § 115, and Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, §§ 104-106, 28 March 2006 ), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee ’ s diseases or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis ( ibid., §§ 109 and 114; Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 79, 4 October 2005; and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 211, 13 July 2006).

The Court observes, in particular, that neither the SIZO administration nor the chief doctor of the local children ’ s hospital was able to respond to the first applicant ’ s lawyer ’ s enquiries about the baby ’ s health sent on 28 August and 6 September 2012 respectively. It was only after the complete medical examination (undertaken in an unrelated context – see paragraphs 62 and 63 above) that the SIZO administration sent the baby ’ s medical file to the lawyer. Furthermore, if he had indeed been examined by a paediatrician on 12 June and 20 July 2012 as recorded in that file, it is not clear why the chief doctor of the children ’ s hospital referred only to the examination on 28 May 2012 in his letter of 6 September 2012.

In one such case, in determining the quantum of the award of non-pecuniary damages, the Sofia City Administrative Court held, by reference to this Court ’ s case-law, that it should not be too strict in requiring detained asylum-seekers to prove that they had suffered mentally as a result of their unduly prolonged decision (see реш. № 4059 от 17.06.2013 г. по адм. д. № 3527/2013 г., АдмС ‑ София-град ).

Even so, in 2013 the Court noted that, although the Bulgarian courts ’ case-law regarding conditions of detention under that provision had initially developed in relation to correctional and pre-trial detention facilities, it had, as demonstrated by that case, also been applied in relation to immigration detention facilities. The Court went on to say that if there was doubt regarding whether a remedy was likely to succeed, it had to be attempted, and on that basis concluded that by not bringing such a claim an alien aggrieved by the conditions in which he had been kept in an immigration detention facility in Sofia had failed to exhaust domestic remedies (see Djalti, cited above, §§ 73, 74 and 76 )."

As regards the reliability of that evidence, it should be noted that the two video files submitted by the applicants bore time stamps which dated from not long after the time of their detention in Bulgaria (see paragraph 16 above). In view of the applicants ’ explanations on that point ( see paragraph 17 above ), and since it is well known that electronic files can be automatically re-dated when copied from one device to another, the Court finds that the time stamps on the two video files do not throw doubt on their authenticity. The footage is, for its part, sufficiently clear, and there are no signs that it has been manipulated. Indeed, the Bulgarian authorities confirmed that the people featuring on it were the applicants ( see paragraph 18 above ). It is true that there are no elements in the video – such as text written in Cyrillic or words spoken in Bulgarian – which could enable the Court positively to ascertain that it was recorded inside the border police ’ s detention facility in Vidin where the applicants were held. At the same time, there are no elements which suggest otherwise. In these circumstances, the mere expression of misapprehensions by the Government on that point cannot cause the Court to doubt that the video depicts, as asserted by the applicants, that facility. Although it was open to the Government to submit visual material – such as photographs or a video recording of the premises where the applicants had been kept according to official records – or other evidence casting doubt in that respect, they did not back their assertions with such evidence ( see paragraph 19 above ). According to the Court ’ s case-law, when applicants produce prima facie credible accounts or evidence that the conditions in which they were detained were inhuman or degrading, it is for the respondent Government to come up with explanations or evidence which can cast doubt in that respect, failing which the Court may find the applicants ’ allegations proven (see, among other authorities, Ananyev and Others v.

Malta, nos. 25794/13 and 28151/13, § 103, 22 November 2016 ). Indeed, the child ’ s extreme vulnerability is the decisive factor and takes precedence over considerations relating to the status of illegal immigrant. Article 22 § 1 of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (1577 UNTS 3) encourages States to take appropriate measures to ensure that children seeking refugee status, whether or not accompanied by their parents or others, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance (see Popov v.

The Court noted that unlike the detention facility at issue in Popov (cited above), the material conditions in the two detention facilities concerned in those five cases had not been problematic. They had been adapted for families that had been kept apart from other detainees and provided with specially fitted rooms and child- care materials. However, one of the facilities had been situated right next to the runways of an airport, and so had exposed the applicants to particularly high noise levels. In the other facility, the internal yard had been separated from the zone for male detainees by only a net, and the noise levels had also been significant. That had affected the children considerably. Another source of anxiety had been the constraints inherent in a place of detention and the conditions in which the facilities had been organised. Although over a short period of time those factors had not been sufficient to attain the threshold of severity engaging Article 3 of the Convention, over a longer period their effects would necessarily have affected a young child to the point of exceeding that threshold. Since the periods of detention had been, in the Court ’ s view, long enough in all five cases, it found breaches of Article 3 in each of them (see R.M. and Others v.

They explained that the interpreter, who had facilitated their communication with their representative, was employed by the SAJE on a monthly salary; that was why his services had not been billed separately. In support of their claim, the applicants submitted a bill of costs drawn up by their representative.

The Court observes that during the entire period of detention the applicant ’ s access to natural light and air was significantly restricted, to the point of being virtually non-existent. The window in his cell had frosted glass which greatly reduced the amount of natural light penetrating to the inside and required the artificial lighting to be kept on at all times. It appears that the window did not open and that the air only circulated through the mandatory ventilation system. The possibility for outdoor exercise was limited to one hour a day. It follows that for three and a half years the applicant was practically confined to his cell with no transparent window or access to natural air (compare Peers, cited above, § 75). Moreover, the exercise yards could hardly afford any real possibility for exercise, being just two square metres larger than the cells. They were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with the opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. Obviously the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation. In addition, on the days of court hearings, the applicant forfeited the opportunity to go to the exercise yard."

The [first-instance] court gave only a general list of information and documents ..., without specifying which information and documents and when [the applicant] had communicated. As the offences imputed to [the applicant] were continuous in time and spanned the period from 1992-1993 to July 1998, during which period Russian legislation evolved, the determination of these issues is of crucial importance for the case.",

Such a list was first established in the federal law ‘ On the introduction of changes and amendments to the State Secrets Act ’ of 6 October 1997. Hence, until that date there was no list of information constituting State secrets that met the requirements of the Constitution. As there is no indication in the judgment about when exactly [the applicant] transmitted information and documents, it is impossible to reach the correct conclusion as to which of the offences imputed to the applicant were committed during the period when the federal law containing a list of State secrets and compatible with the requirements of the Constitution was in force.",

This definition was included in the terminology part [of the law] in order to bring its original wording into compliance with the Russian Constitution. Since the information constituting State secrets cannot be explicitly enumerated in the law, the approach chosen was that the list was to be understood as an aggregate of the relatively generic categories of information described in section 5 of the new law [i.e. that of 6 October 1997].",

The Court reiterates that in certain cases the lack of personal space afforded to detainees in Russian remand prisons was so extreme as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq .m of personal space (see, for example, Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 59, 6 December 2007; Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, § § 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, §§ 47-49, 29 March 2007; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44, 16 June 2005 ). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four sq. m per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § § 70-72, ECHR 2001 ‑ III )."

These fittings further reduced the floor surface available to detainees. It is of particular concern for the Court that there existed no partition or separation between the living area and the lavatory which was not equipped with any kind of flush. Such a close proximity was not only objectionable from a sanitary perspective but also deprived the detainees using the toilet of any privacy. This situation must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medicine in full view of his cellmates and the wardens who watched through the peephole."

The Court observes that during the entire period of detention the applicant ’ s access to natural light and air was significantly restricted, to the point of being virtually non-existent. The window in his cell had frosted glass which greatly reduced the amount of natural light penetrating to the inside and required the artificial lighting to be kept on at all times. It appears that the window did not open and that the air only circulated through the mandatory ventilation system. The possibility for outdoor exercise was limited to one hour a day. It follows that for three and a half years the applicant was practically confined to his cell with no transparent window or access to natural air (compare Peers, cited above, § 75). Moreover, the exercise yards could hardly afford any real possibility for exercise, being just two square metres larger than the cells. They were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with the opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. Obviously the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation. In addition, on the days of court hearings, the applicant forfeited the opportunity to go to the exercise yard."

In reality, the prison vans had been filled beyond their design capacity and he had never been transported alone.

            [
                "131. On the facts, the Court observes that the applicant was transported to the court hearings in standard-issue prison vans on more than one hundred and fifty days. The passenger cabins of those vans were designed for the transportation of twenty-five detainees on a floor space measuring less than nine square metres, which left an area of approximately fifty by fifty centimetres for each detainee. The height of the cabin (1.6 m) was not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van. The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s claim that the applicant was always transported alone further to a special request by the prison administration, because a copy of that request was not produced. The Government did not comment on the total number of detainees transported by prison vans. However, it appears that overcrowding of prison vans transporting prisoners in Moscow was one of the problems reported by the authority in charge of remand centres as a result of an inquiry carried out in 2003 (see the letter of 26 November 2003 from the head of the Moscow Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, cited in Starokadomskiy v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 42239/02, 12 January 2006 ).

The Government admitted that the heating and lighting systems were only operational when the engine was running. Given that there were no windows or other openings giving access to natural light, the detainees remained in darkness – and, occasionally, in the cold – once the engine was stopped. Natural ventilation through the emergency hatches was obviously inadequate on hot days, given the cramped conditions inside the van, and was, moreover, not directly accessible to detainees from within the cubicles."

            [
                "133. The Court observes that the applicant remained in these conditions for extended periods of time on each journey. Admittedly, the Lefortovo prison is located not far from the Moscow City Court and the direct route would have hardly required more than thirty minutes. However, the Government did not refute, or comment upon, the applicant ’ s submission that prison vans called on their way into other remand centres, namely Matrosskaya Tishina or Butyrka, located much farther from the City Court. The detainees remained locked inside the vans during the detours and loading and unloading of other prisoners. The detailed information produced by the applicant in respect of travelling time on specific dates was likewise unrebutted by any relevant documents which the Government must have had in their possession. In fact, a response by the Moscow police department to the applicant ’ s complaint contained an acknowledgment of delays in transportation of detainees (see paragraph 67 above). Thus, whereas it is impossible to establish with absolute certainty the duration of a journey on every occasion, what is important for the Court ’ s assessment is that the time spent by the applicant inside the van was far from negligible and amounted on average to five or six hours per day, and was occasionally as long as ten hours."

                "134. The Court reiterates that the assessment of the minimum level of severity which a given form of treatment must attain if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162, and Kudła, cited above, § 91). The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kudła, cited above, § 92). Thus, the Court has found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant was transported together with one other detainee in a single-occupancy cubicle which measured one square metre. Although the travel time did not exceed one hour, the Court considered such transport arrangements inhuman and degrading, irrespective of the duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § § 118-120, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... (extracts) )."

Given that he had to stay inside that confined space for several hours, these cramped conditions must have caused him intense physical suffering. His suffering must have been further aggravated by the absence of adequate ventilation and lighting, and unreliable heating. Having regard to the cumulative effect which these conditions of transport must have had on the applicant, the Court finds that the conditions of transport from the remand centre to the courthouse and back amounted to “inhuman” treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. It is also relevant to the Court ’ s assessment that the applicant was subjected to such treatment during his trial or at the hearings with regard to applications for an extension of his detention, that is, when he most needed his powers of concentration and mental alertness (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 120)."

Accordingly, not only were they tiny in surface area – by any account no more than two square metres – but also, by their design, they lacked the amenities indispensable for longer detention. The cell did not have a window and offered no access to natural light or air. Its equipment was limited to a bench, there being no chair, table or any other furniture. It is of a particular concern for the Court that the cell did not have a toilet and that detainees could only relieve themselves on the wardens ’ orders. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any catering arrangements which would have enabled the detainees to receive sufficient and wholesome food and drink on a regular basis. The Court considers it unacceptable for a person to be detained in conditions in which no provision has been made for meeting his or her basic needs (see Riad and Idiab v.

In view of the essential link between Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence”, as specified in the latter provision, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 § 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty “after conviction by a competent court” (see Kudła, cited above, § 104, and Barfuss v. the Czech Republic ( dec. ), no. 35848/97, 7 September 1999). Accordingly, the applicant ’ s detention from 16 December 1999, the date of his first conviction, to 25 July 2000, the date on which that conviction was quashed and his case remitted, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 § 3. The Court consequently finds that the period to be taken into consideration consisted of two separate terms, the first lasting from 3 July 1998 to 16 December 1999 and the second from 25 July 2000 to 14 August 2001, and amounted to two years and slightly more than six months in total."

It observes that at no point in the proceedings did the domestic authorities consider whether the length of his detention had already lasted beyond a “reasonable time”. The fact that the maximum time-limits permitted by the domestic law were not exceeded may not be a decisive element in the Court ’ s assessment. As the Court has previously found in other Russian cases, the calculation of the domestic time-limits depended solely on the gravity of the charges, which was decided upon by the prosecution and was not subject to judicial review (see Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no. 7649/02, § 43, 14 December 2006, and Khudoyorov, cited above, § 180)."

Acting in accordance with these provisions, the domestic courts extended the applicant ’ s detention and rejected his petitions for release, relying on the gravity of the charges against him as the only relevant and sufficient ground (see, in particular, the decisions of 5 and 11 September 2000 ). They also occasionally mentioned other grounds, such as the risk of absconding or interference with justice (see the decisions of 1 February and 4 June 1999 ). Finally, in other instances the judicial review of the grounds for application of the custodial measure was confined to a verification of the formal lawfulness of the decision (see the decisions of 10, 20 and 31 July 2001)."

Russia, no. 72967/01, § 101, 1 March 2007; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, § 81, 26 July 2001; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 51). This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts – and thus the sentence faced by the applicant – is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence that has so far been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, loc. cit. )."

The requirement that a decision be given “speedily” is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 § 1 cases, Article 5 § 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, § 79, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV).

The possibility of replacing a judge who could “no longer take part in the proceedings” should normally be used only in exceptional circumstances such as the judge ’ s death, serious illness, retirement, and suspension or termination of his judicial function by the judges ’ qualifications panel.

A court President had no legal obligation to give grounds for substitutions and replacements.

In his case, the changes in the composition of the bench had always come unannounced and no reasons had been given.

The assignment of a case to a particular judge or court falls within the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in such matters. There is a wide range of factors, such as, for instance, resources available, qualification of judges, conflict of interests, accessibility of the place of hearings for the parties etc., which the authorities must take into account when assigning a case. Although it is not the role of the Court to assess whether there were valid grounds for the domestic authorities to (re) assign a case to a particular judge or court, the Court must be satisfied that such ( re ) assignment was compatible with Article 6 § 1, and, in particular, with its requirements of objective independence and impartiality (see Bochan, cited above, § 72)."

This principle, known as the rule of immutability of the court composition, was set out at the material time in Article 24 1 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 110 above, now Article 242 ). The rule of immutability provided for the possibility of replacing a judge who was no longer able to take part in the proceedings with another judge. It was applicable to professional and lay judges alike, the status of the latter being identical to the status of the former in the administration of justice (see paragraph 111 above)."

Each replacement of the presiding judge was followed by the replacement of both lay judges. In addition, on one occasion the substitute lay judge was called upon to step into the proceedings, and on another a new lay judge had to be designated to replace one who had withdrawn from the case.

The Government did not explain how this inordinate number of changes in the bench – which is striking in comparison to other Russian criminal cases that have come before the Court – could be reconciled with the rule of immutability of the court composition, the fundamental importance of which they themselves emphasised. It is a matter of utmost concern for the Court that not only were replacements particularly frequent in the applicant ’ s case but that the reasons for such replacements were only made known on two occasions. Firstly, the case was reassigned from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval on account of the former judge ’ s indisposition, the reality and intensity of which is disputed by the applicant. Secondly, lay judge A.A., sitting with Judge Komarova, withdrew for family reasons and was replaced by lay judge A.M. As the Government acknowledged at the pre-admissibility stage, there was no mention in the trial record of the reasons for the other replacements. In the post-admissibility submission they claimed that Judge Koval had been replaced by Judge Komarova because of the former judge ’ s continued involvement in other criminal proceedings. However, this assertion is both at variance with their pre-admissibility position and belied by the fact that Judge Koval was succeeded by Judge Medvedev rather than by Judge Komarova, who entered the proceedings at a later stage."

The Court notes that Article 241 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure only mentioned the possibility of replacing a judge who was “no longer able to take part in the proceedings”, without setting out the circumstances in which such a replacement was possible or indeed required. Despite the Court ’ s explicit request to that effect, the Government omitted to cite any examples of judicial interpretation of the provision in question. Although Article 241 may be presumed to encompass such situations as voluntary withdrawal of a judge, recusation by a party or external events that would preclude him or her from continuing to sit – for example, discontinuation of his or her judicial status by the qualifications board, there was no indication that any such circumstances occurred during the applicant ’ s trial. None of the replaced judges expressed a wish to resign from sitting in the case, was successfully challenged or had their judicial status suspended or terminated. Although the adequacy of the grounds for reassignment of the case from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval was a matter of controversy between the parties, eight replacements of the judges sitting in the applicant ’ s trial took place for reasons that remained unknown to the applicant and could not be ascertained in the Strasbourg proceedings. In the Court ’ s assessment, the replacement of a sitting judge for which no reason was given can only be described as arbitrary."

The Court further observes that, as with the distribution of incoming cases among judges, the power to reassign a pending criminal case to another presiding judge was habitually exercised by the President of a court. It transpires in the instant case that two reassignments were explicitly ordered by the President or acting President of the City Court (from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval, and later from Judge Medvedev to Judge Komarova ). As the Court has found above, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which such reassignment could occur. The lack of foreseeability in the application of Article 241 had the effect of giving the President of the Moscow City Court unfettered discretion in the matter of replacement and reassignment of judges in the applicant ’ s criminal case. In this connection the Court emphasises that no procedural safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of the discretion were incorporated in Article 241. Thus, it did not require that the parties be informed of the reasons for the reassignment of the case or given an opportunity to comment on the matter (compare Bochan, cited above, § 72). Furthermore, the replacement of a member of the bench was not set out in any procedural decision amenable to judicial review by a higher court. The Court considers that the absence of any procedural safeguards in the text of the law rendered the members of the bench vulnerable to outside pressure."

Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, § 33). In the present case it may be assumed that the Supreme Court, sitting as a court of appeal, should have had the power to quash the conviction on the ground of a serious violation of criminal procedure, such as a breach of the rule of immutability of court composition (Article 342 (4) of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure). Although the applicant referred to this breach in his statement of appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in their entirety. As a consequence, it did not cure the failing in question (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 134, ECHR 2005 ‑ ...; De Haan v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 August 1997, Reports 1997 - IV, §§ 52-55; and Findlay, cited above, §§ 78-79)."

It had taken the Supreme Court almost seven months to examine the first appeal; in the second appeal proceedings, the file had been sent from the City Court to the Supreme Court almost four months after the conviction, and its subsequent examination had lasted five months.

The Court takes note of the Government ’ s assertion that at no point in the proceedings was permission for a visit by counsel unreasonably withheld. Nevertheless, it has no doubt that the need to apply for an individual permit for every visit created considerable practical difficulties in the exercise of the rights of the defence because it detracted time and effort from pursuing the defence team ’ s substantive mission. What causes the Court still greater concern is that this arrangement put the defence in a position of dependence on, and subordination to, the discretion of the prosecution and therefore destroyed the appearance of the equality of arms. On several occasions the Federal Security Service abused the dominant position it had in the matter by refusing to accept Mrs Moskalenko ’ s request for an unrestricted permit or threatening criminal prosecution against her in the absence of any evidence that the permit had been forged (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above)."

Throughout the proceedings the bill of indictment had been kept either at the special department of the remand prison or special registry of the City Court, from where it could not be removed.

Nevertheless, even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights, such as the right to a fair trial, should have a lawful basis and should be appropriate to achieve their protective function. In the present case the Government did not invoke any act or regulation or other provision of domestic law governing the functioning of special departments in remand prisons or special registries in the courts. Nor did they put forward any justification for the sweeping nature of the restrictions on the applicant ’ s access to the case materials. They did not explain why the domestic authorities had not been able to present the bill of indictment in such a way that the classified information be contained in a separate annex, which would have then been the only part with restricted access. Likewise, it does not appear that the Russian authorities considered separating the case materials constituting State secrets from all the other materials, such as for instance, the courts ’ procedural decisions, to which access should in principle be unrestricted. Finally, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant and his defence team could not remove their own notes in order to show them to an expert or use them for any other purpose effectively prevented them from using the information contained in them, since they had then to rely solely on their recollections (see Matyjek, cited above, § 59, and Luboch v.

The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court ’ s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek, §§ 59 and 63, and Luboch, § § 64 and 68, both cited above). This finding applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case, where the applicant stood trial and could forfeit not just his good name or possibility to hold public office (as in lustration proceedings) but his liberty.

In a case where applicants had to face a vitally important trial in a state of lowered physical and mental resistance following an exhausting overnight transfer by prison van, the Court noted this circumstance as one of the factors undermining the requirements of a fair trial. It went on to state that “despite the assistance of their lawyers, who had the opportunity to make submissions, this circumstance, regrettable in itself, undoubtedly weakened [the applicants ’ ] position at a vital moment when they needed all their resources to defend themselves and, in particular, to face up to questioning at the very start of the trial and to consult effectively with their counsel” (see Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain, judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, §§ 71 and 89). In the same vein, the Court found a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 in the case where the hearing in a criminal case lasted more than seventeen hours, with the result that not only the accused and his defence but also the judges had been in a state of extreme exhaustion (see Makhfi v.

The applicant could not read or write, since he was confined to such a tiny space with so many other detainees. The suffering and frustration which the applicant must have felt on account of the inhuman conditions of transport and confinement undoubtedly impaired his faculty for concentration and intense mental application in the hours immediately preceding the court hearings. Admittedly, he was assisted by a team of professional attorneys who could make submissions on his behalf. Nevertheless, taking into account the nature of the issues raised in the proceedings and their close connection to the applicant ’ s field of competence, the Court considers that his ability to instruct his counsel effectively and to consult with them was of primordial importance.

By a ruling of 20 December 1995, the Constitutional Court had confirmed that the establishment of criminal sanctions for communication of State or military secret to a foreign State was compatible with the Constitution. The terminological difference between the initial wording of section 5 of the State Secrets Act and its text as amended on 6 October 1997 could not justify the conclusion that, prior to the enactment of the amendments, a person could not be held criminally liable for encroachments on the constitutional foundations and security of Russia.

It is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-C, §§ 34-35 and §§ 32-33; and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

High treason was punishable until 1 January 1997 under Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal Code and thereafter under Article 275 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which defined the offence in a substantially similar way. The sanctions, however, were different: whereas Article 64 laid down that high treason was punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty, Article 275 envisages a term of imprisonment as the main sanction for the same offence.

The documents obtained from the KCIA had listed the applicant as a Moscow resident of that organisation. The applicant had copied certain work documents, as per the list prepared by Mr C., and had transmitted those documents to him. The domestic courts deemed those elements sufficient to find the applicant guilty of the offence of high treason in the form of espionage, having regard in particular to the fact that this offence did not necessarily involve communication of information constituting a State secret.

In deciding, secondly, whether the domestic courts ’ interpretation of the crime of espionage could reasonably be foreseen by the applicant at the material time, the Court notes that both the RSFSR Criminal Code (Articles 64 and 65) and the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation defined the concept of “espionage” in similar terms. These provisions explicitly referred to the collection of “other information” (that is, not constitutive of a State secret) at the request of a foreign intelligence service. The Court considers that the consequences of failure to comply with those laws were adequately foreseeable, not only with the assistance of legal advice, but also as a matter of common sense (compare Kuolelis and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 74357/01, 26764/02 and 27434/02, § 121, 19 February 2008). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was – as in the present case – consistent with the essence of that offence, must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable (see Jorgic v.

Given that the legal characterisation was identical in both situations, the Court does not discern any legal basis to assume that in either case a heavier penalty would be imposed. In these circumstances, having regard to the above finding that the applicant ’ s conviction for communication of non-classified information was not in breach of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine separately whether the applicant could reasonably have foreseen that he would be convicted under the same provision of the Criminal Code for communication of sensitive information which was subsequently found to constitute a State secret.",

The Court is therefore satisfied that the refusal had a basis in domestic law. It reiterates, however, that the expression “in accordance with the law” does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, Lupsa v. Romania, no. 10337/04, §§ 32 and 34, ECHR 2006-..., and Al- Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 119, 20 June 2002)."

However, it fell short of the requirement of foreseeability because it conferred unfettered discretion on the investigator in the matter of family visits but did not define the circumstances in which a family visit could be refused. The impugned provision went no further than implying the possibility of refusing family visits, without saying anything about the length of the measure or the reasons that could warrant its application. No mention was made of the possibility of challenging a refusal to issue an authorisation or whether a court was competent to rule on such a challenge. It follows that the provisions of Russian law governing family visits did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities, so that the applicant did not enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (compare Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 100, 13 September 2005, and Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, §§ 32-33).

As to the necessity of the impugned measure in a democratic society, the Court reiterates that in a series of Italian cases it has already examined a prison regime substantially similar to that to which the applicant was subjected. The regime at issue restricted the number of family visits to not more than two per month and provided for prisoners ’ separation from visitors by a glass partition. Taking into account the specific nature of the phenomenon of Mafia-type organised crime, in which family relations often play a crucial role, the Court noted that the special regime was instrumental in curtailing the contacts of imprisoned Mafia members with the outside world and preventing them from organising and procuring the commission of crimes both inside and outside their prisons. This led the Court to accept that in the critical circumstances of the investigations of the Mafia being conducted by the Italian authorities, the measures complained of were necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim (see, among others, Messina (no. 2), cited above, §§ 65-67, and Indelicato v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 31143/96, 6 July 2000 )."

                "255. In the present case the Government did not put forward any argument for justification of the restriction beyond a reference to the applicable section of the Custody Act. The Court notes with concern that the Custody Act restricted the maximum frequency of family visits to two per month in a general manner, without affording any degree of flexibility for determining whether such limitations were appropriate or indeed necessary in each individual case. As regards the applicant ’ s personal situation, the Court is unable to discern the necessity for such stringent limitations on the frequency and duration of family visits. It notes that the applicant ’ s wife was neither a witness nor a co-accused in the criminal proceedings against him, which removed the risk of collusive action or other obstruction to the process of collecting evidence (see, by contrast, Kučera, cited above, § 130; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Klamecki, cited above, § 135). The same can be said of the applicant ’ s daughter, who was still a minor at the material time. Furthermore, the security considerations relating to criminal family links which had been found to be justified in the above-mentioned Italian cases were conspicuously absent in the instant case. In these circumstances, and having regard to the duration of the limitations on the applicant ’ s contact with his family, the Court concludes that they went beyond what was necessary in a democratic society “to prevent disorder and crime”. Indeed, the measure in question reduced the applicant ’ s family life to a degree that can be justified neither by the inherent limitations involved in detention nor by the pursuance of the legitimate aim relied on by the Government. The Court therefore holds that the authorities failed to maintain a fair balance of proportionality between the means employed and the aim they sought to achieve."

                "257. The Court notes that the Government did not refer to any legal or regulatory act as the basis for installing a glass partition in the cabin for meetings between detainees and their visitors. The wording which could be considered as authorising such a measure in remand centres could be found in the Internal Rules for Remand Centres of the Ministry of Justice (paragraph 147 of order no. 148 of 12 May 2000). However, these provisions were not applicable in the applicant ’ s case because at that time the Lefortovo remand centre was outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and under the management of the Federal Security Service. Although comparable provisions might be contained in the rules for the remand centres under the jurisdiction of the Federal Security Service, such rules – assuming they had been adopted as required by section 16 of the Custody Act – were never published or made otherwise publicly accessible. It follows that the impugned measure was not “prescribed by law”."
            ],
            [
                "258. In any event, the Court reiterates that, although physical separation of a detainee from his visitors may be justified by security considerations in certain cases (see the above-cited Italian cases and also the Dutch cases concerning a prison regime designed to prevent escapes: Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 71, ECHR 2003 ‑ II, and Lorsé and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, § 85, 4 February 2003 ), the measure cannot be considered necessary in the absence of any established security risk (see Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 117, 19 June 2007 ). As the Court has found above, in the present case there were no security considerations warranting the application of such restrictions. In addition, the Court notes that the applicant was denied any physical contact with his visitors for the entire duration of his detention, that is, for more than three and a half years. The effect of such a long period of time, which must have taken a heavy toll on the applicant and his family, is a further factor weighing in favour of a finding that the contested measure was disproportionate (compare Ciorap, cited above, § 118). In sum, the Court finds that in the absence of any demonstrated need for such far-reaching restrictions on the applicant ’ s right to respect for family life, the measures at issue cannot be justified under the second paragraph of Article 8."

                "266. As was reiterated in paragraph 249 above, the expression “in accordance with the law” also refers to the quality of the law in question which must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. The text of section 20 of the Custody Act provided for censorship of all correspondence by detainees in general terms, without distinguishing between different categories of correspondence, such as, for example, private correspondence and correspondence with legal counsel. The Court has already found that such a form of censorship, which effectively gave the remand prison administration an open licence for indiscriminate and routine checking of all of the applicant ’ s correspondence, was incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention (see Čiapas v. Lithuania, no. 4902/02, § 25, 16 November 2006, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005 ). This reasoning applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case, where the Custody Act afforded the remand centre administration unchecked discretion in the matter of censorship, without defining the length or scope of the measure, the reasons that may warrant its application, or the manner of its exercise, be it opening, reading, stopping, withholding or another form of control. Furthermore, the Custody Act made no provision for an independent review of the scope and duration of censorship measures. The lack of any safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of discretion by the remand centre administration resulted in extraordinary and unusual restrictions imposed on the applicant, such as the prohibition on having more than two photographs in the cell or keeping his letters for longer than twenty-four hours. It follows that the provisions of Russian law failed to afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his correspondence. The impugned restrictions on the applicant ’ s correspondence cannot therefore be regarded as having been “prescribed by law”. In the light of the above finding, it is not necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with."

Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of 3 to 4 square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v.

The applicants alleged that six inmates were held in the cell. The Government, while acknowledging that there were six sleeping places in the cell, stated that the number of inmates varied between five and six but provided no official documents to demonstrate that during the period of the applicants ’ detention fewer then six inmates were held in their cell. In this connection, the Court notes that the overcrowding in the prison in question has been acknowledged by the prison authorities. During the relevant period the occupancy of the prison twice exceeded its official capacity (see paragraph 44 above). The situation was particularly serious as regards remand prisoners (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). The Court therefore finds that even if occasionally they were afforded a little more than 3 square metres of personal space, the applicants were at least for a significant part of their detention held in a cell in which the personal space available to them was 2.7 square metres, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cell. This state of affairs in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sulejmanovic, cited above, §§ 43 and 44, and Modarca v.

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant ’ s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman ’ s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above).

As regards the complaints under Article 8 concerning contact with persons outside the prison, the Court reiterates that detention, like any other measure depriving a person of his liberty, entails inherent limitations on his private and family life. However, it is an essential part of a detainee ’ s right to respect for his family life that the authorities enable him or, if need be, help him to maintain contact with his close family. Such restrictions as limitations imposed on the number of family visits, supervision of those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visiting arrangements constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision. Nevertheless, any restriction of that kind must be applied “in accordance with the law”, must pursue one or more of the legitimate aims listed in paragraph 2 and, in addition, must be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see, among other authorities, Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 246, 9 October 2008)."

In so far as the applicants may be understood as complaining that their contact with other people by telephone or visits was restricted more than was required by the legislation, while noting that certain concerns in this area were raised by the CPT after its visit in 2006 (see paragraph 43 above), the Court finds that the applicants have not submitted any evidence or concrete information which would indicate that they were unable to use the facilities in question in accordance with the law.

A request for transfer should be made by the prison governor to the competent domestic court. Section 55 includes overcrowding in the list of grounds for transfer. The Government submitted photocopies of 21 court orders concerning transfers of remand prisoners from Ljubljana prison to other prisons in Slovenia. Most of the orders refer to paragraph 1 of section 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand but do not disclose the exact reasons for the transfer, merely referring to the justification given by the prison governor in his requests, copies of which were not enclosed.

The Administrative Court had full jurisdiction to decide questions of fact and law in such proceedings. According to the Government, such a claim constituted an effective remedy by which the applicants could have secured the immediate termination of the violation. In addition, the Government argued that the applicants could have lodged a request for an interim order and for compensation. As regards the latter, the Administrative Court would rule on such a request unless it would considerably delay the proceedings."

In support of their argument, the Government submitted copies of twelve Administrative Court decisions, half of which were issued in proceedings instituted on the basis of section 4 of the Administrative Disputes Act, and the other half in the context of regular administrative proceedings in which administrative decisions were challenged before the Administrative Court. Eight decisions deal with issues of appointments, election and mandates. The remainder concern the refusal to issue an administrative decision, the right to examine a case-file, subscription to a nursery and the payment of compulsory contributions to a Chamber of Commerce. The Government admitted that the decisions did not concern complaints relating to overcrowding or inhuman and degrading conditions in detention. However, they were of the opinion that the applicants could nevertheless have availed themselves of this remedy, which offered all the elements of relief required in this kind of case."

In particular claimants could seek the termination of an ongoing infringement by means of an injunction.

In connection with the claim for compensation under Section 179 of the Civil Code, the Government maintained that the jurisprudence generally acknowledged psychological anguish caused by the restriction of liberty or the infringement of personal rights as a legally recognised form of non-pecuniary damage. In this respect they submitted copies of 15 court decisions. Nine of them concern damage caused by environmental nuisances. The others concern damage relating to unlawful detention, defamation, unauthorised publication of photos, sexual assault, distress related to exhumation and the invasion of privacy. Since there is no reason why the domestic courts would selectively protect certain personal rights but not for example the right to decent treatment in detention, the applicants ’ doubts as to the effectiveness of the compensation claim in the cases in question were unfounded."

On 20 May 2011 the Government informed the Court that a first judgment on this matter was delivered by the Ljubljana Local Court on 9 May 2011. The court found in favour of the plaintiff, a detainee who spent about six months (in the period between July 2006 and March 2007) in Ljubljana prison as a remand prisoner. For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres. The court found that all four elements of civil tort were established, namely: unlawful act, occurrence of damage, causal link and the defendant ’ s responsibility. The court noted that there had been no jurisprudence on this matter so far and that this was the first judgment to establish the principles for the future. Referring also to Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI, the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the Convention represented minimum standards and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond this minimum. It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation on the Execution of Sentence and was therefore in breach of the claimant ’ s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant ’ s personal rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table and to use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations. Moreover, the court found that these conditions amounted also to a violation of Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The claimant was awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 2,290 euros (EUR)."

At the time when they ordered the applicants ’ detention the courts had no possibility of placing a remand prisoner in another prison with available space (see paragraph 27 above).

Moreover, the Court observes that the prison authorities were aware of the overcrowding in the remand section of the prison (see paragraphs 44 ‑ 4 8 above). In 2010 they put in place a system whereby a request for transfer would be made when the number of prisoners exceeded 245 (see paragraph 46 above).

In support of their argument, the Government referred to past decisions of the Administrative Court. However, those decisions arose from situations which do not even remotely relate to that of the applicants (see paragraph 99 above).

It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of prison conditions. The Court would limit itself to observing that it is unaware of any decision that would demonstrate that a claim concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons could be brought directly to the Administrative Court with any prospect of putting a timely end to an alleged violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ciorap v.

Subsequently, they submitted to the court a recent judgment of 9 May 2011 in which a local court found that the claimant ’ s personal rights as well as the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degradation treatment was violated on account of inadequate conditions in Ljubljana prison.

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts.

However, it must be observed that a lack of resources cannot in principle justify prison conditions which are so poor as to reach the threshold of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see among others Nazarenko v. Ukraine, no. 39483/98, § 144, 29 April 2003) and that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see Mamedova v.

Although the Court does not consider that it can at present conclude that there exists a structural problem consisting of “a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” nationwide, it would emphasize the need to take steps to reduce the number of prisoners in Ljubljana prison and by doing so to put an end to the existing situation which appears to disregard the dignity of a considerable number of detainees held therein and to prevent future violations of Article 3 on that account. It would draw the Government ’ s attention to the CPT ’ s recommendation for Ljubljana prison that no more than four prisoners should be held in cells measuring 18 square metres ( including the sanitary annex, see paragraphs 42 and 43 above)."

Lastly, the Court takes note of the judgment of 9 May 2011 and observes that the civil claim for compensation under section 174 of the Civil Code may, if proved effective in future, due to its compensatory nature, be of value only to persons who are no longer detained in overcrowded cells in conditions not complying with Article 3 requirements (see paragraph 116 above). A ruling of a civil court cannot, however, have any impact on general prison conditions because it cannot address the root cause of the problem. For that reason, the Court would, in addition to the measures aimed at reducing the occupancy level in cells in Ljubljana prison, encourage the State to develop an effective instrument which would provide a speedy reaction to complaints concerning inadequate conditions of detention and ensure that, when necessary, a transfer of a detainee is ordered to Convention compatible conditions (see Orchowski, cited above, § 154).",

By contrast, the applicant was of the opinion that allowing access to three more websites ( in addition to those already authorised ) would not have given rise to any additional security issues. Possible security issues were already effectively managed by the Ministry of Justice, which blocked any links or other such features on already authorised websites that could cause security concerns; there was no reason, according to the applicant, why this should be different in the case of the three requested additional websites."

The Court notes that the websites of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Riigikogu, to which the applicant wished to have access, predominantly contained legal information and information related to fundamental rights, including the rights of prisoners. For example, the website of the Riigikogu contained bills together with explanatory memoranda to them, verbatim records of the sittings of the Riigikogu, and minutes of committee sittings. The website of the Chancellor of Justice (who is also an ombudsman in Estonia) contained his selected legal opinions. The Court considers that the accessibility of such information promotes public awareness and respect for human rights and gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the Estonian courts used such information and the applicant needed access to it for the protection of his rights in the court proceedings. The Court has also taken note of the applicant ’ s argument that legal research in the form of browsing through available information (in order to find relevant information) and making specific requests for information were different matters and that the websites were meant for legal researches rather than making specific requests. Indeed, in order to make a specific request one would need to be aware of which particular information is available in the first place. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities have referred to alternative means of making available to the applicant the information stored on the websites in question (for example, by mail – see paragraph 17 above), but did not compare the costs of these alternative means with the additional costs that extended Internet access would allegedly incur."

The Court notes, in this connection, that when the applicant lodged his complaint with the domestic courts, the Estonian translations and summaries of the Court ’ s judgments were only available on the website of the Council of Europe Information Office and it was only later that this information was published elsewhere – in the online version of Riigi Teataja (see paragraph 40 above)."

The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives. Indeed, an increasing amount of services and information is only available on the Internet, as evidenced by the fact that in Estonia the official publication of legal acts effectively takes place via the online version of Riigi Teataja and no longer through its paper version (see paragraph 7 above).

While the security and economic considerations cited by the domestic authorities may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts undertook no detailed analysis as to the security risks allegedly emerging from the access to the three additional websites in question, also having regard to the fact that these were websites of State authorities and of an international organisation. The Supreme Court limited its analysis on this point to a rather general statement that granting access to additional Internet sites could increase the risk of detainees engaging in prohibited communication, thus giving rise to the need for increased levels of monitoring. The Court also considers that the Supreme Court and the Government have failed to convincingly demonstrate that giving the applicant access to three additional websites would have caused any noteworthy additional costs.

It noted that the aims of imprisonment included the protection of the legal order and steering detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. As the possibility could not be technically excluded that detainees might misuse the right to use the Internet, access to the Internet was prohibited to them by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act. The exception made in respect of the official databases of legislation and the database of judicial decisions was necessary in order to ensure that detainees were afforded an effective possibility to protect their own rights.

Granting detainees access to any additional Internet site increased the security risk of their obtaining information running contrary to the aims of imprisonment. Moreover, this could create an opportunity for detainees to use the Internet for purposes other than that of freely obtaining information disseminated for public use. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the prohibition of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee was justified by the need to achieve the aims of imprisonment and in particular the need to secure public safety."

In respect of the proportionality of the restriction the Supreme Court considered that the denial of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee prevented them from misusing the Internet via these sites and that public safety was thereby protected. Moreover, granting detainees access to these Internet sites could increase the risk of their engaging in prohibited communication; this in turn would necessitate increased levels of control (and therefore costs). Thus, there were no alternative, equally effective means – besides the prohibition imposed by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act – of achieving the legitimate aim in question. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that detainees were able to contact the Riigikogu and the Chancellor of Justice by mail and make a request for information ( teabenõue ). Therefore, detainees ’ access to the public information contained on the Internet sites in question was not unduly restricted. Detainees ’ access to the Internet site of the European Court of Human Rights was guaranteed, pursuant to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act; those of the Council of Europe ’ s conventions and treaties that had been ratified by Estonia were accessible on the Internet site www.riigiteataja.ee. The Supreme Court noted that it did not doubt that the printed works of the Council of Europe were accessible through prison libraries, and nor were detainees prevented from contacting the Council of Europe by post. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction preventing detainees from accessing the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee, www.riigikogu.ee and www.coe.ee was one of “ low intensity ”; the Supreme Court gave more weight to the aim sought by that restriction. It considered that permitting detainees extensive use of the Internet would increase the likelihood of prison authorities losing control over detainees ’ activities, as it could not be completely excluded that via the Internet sites in question detainees could use the Internet for other, unauthorised purposes. Accordingly, the impugned restriction was in conformity with the Constitution."

They considered that the use of the Internet sites in question did not generally pose a threat to public safety and was in conformity with the aims of imprisonment. It was unclear what additional costs the State would have to bear, since – in line with the applicable law – prisons were equipped with computers specially adapted to allow detainees access to the official databases of legislation and judicial decisions, and the prison service exercised supervision over the use of such resources. The information available on the Internet sites in question aided the exercising of the right of recourse to the courts. While it was true that detainees could also avail themselves of the right to make a request for information, this was a more time-consuming avenue and, particularly in the case of the Internet site of the Chancellor of Justice, required knowledge of which information was available on such Internet sites. No request for information under the Public Information Act ( Avaliku teabe seadus ) could be made to the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. The rulings of the European Court of Human Rights available in the HUDOC database – which was accessible to detainees – were not in Estonian ( unlike the unofficial translations published on the Internet site www.coe.ee ), and it could not be presumed that detainees had sufficient command of English or French to be able to read them.

The Internet, as a medium by which the right to freedom of expression can be exercised, can only serve its purpose if States assume their commitment to develop effective policies to attain universal access to the Internet. Without concrete policies and plans of action, the Internet will become a technological tool that is accessible only to a certain elite while perpetrating the “digital divide”.",

For example, the parliament of Estonia passed legislation in 2000 declaring Internet access a basic human right. The constitutional council of France effectively declared Internet access a fundamental right in 2009, and the constitutional court of Costa Rica reached a similar decision in 2010. Going a step further, Finland passed a decree in 2009 stating that every Internet connection needs to have a speed of at least one Megabit per second (broadband level). The Special Rapporteur also takes note that according to a survey by the British Broadcasting Corporation in March 2010, 79% of those interviewed in 26 countries believe that Internet access is a fundamental human right.",

Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.",

Making additional websites available and technically as secure as possible would incur additional expense. In view of the fact that all websites contained references, search engines, links ( including to social networks ), and the like, and having regard to the fact that websites were updated on a daily basis, it was impossible to completely avoid or prevent security vulnerabilities. It could not be ruled out, for technical reasons, that prisoners could misuse the Internet. Thus, granting prisoners access to additional websites would increase the risk that they might obtain information prejudicial to the realisation of the objectives of imprisonment. The effort needed to reduce the risks arising from such additional access – such risks could not be completely eliminated – would be excessive in comparison with the benefits gained by granting prisoners wider access to the Internet. Thus, the distinction between permitted and prohibited websites was a carefully weighed compromise between the applicant ’ s rights and public safety."

The Court has also found that the function of creating forums for public debate is not limited to the press. That function may also be exercised by non-governmental organisations, the activities of which are an essential element of informed public debate (see, for example, Österreichische Vereinigung zur Erhaltung, Stärkung und Schaffung v.

By contrast, the applicant was of the opinion that allowing access to three more websites ( in addition to those already authorised ) would not have given rise to any additional security issues. Possible security issues were already effectively managed by the Ministry of Justice, which blocked any links or other such features on already authorised websites that could cause security concerns; there was no reason, according to the applicant, why this should be different in the case of the three requested additional websites."

For example, the website of the Riigikogu contained bills together with explanatory memoranda to them, verbatim records of the sittings of the Riigikogu, and minutes of committee sittings. The website of the Chancellor of Justice (who is also an ombudsman in Estonia) contained his selected legal opinions. The Court considers that the accessibility of such information promotes public awareness and respect for human rights and gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the Estonian courts used such information and the applicant needed access to it for the protection of his rights in the court proceedings. The Court has also taken note of the applicant ’ s argument that legal research in the form of browsing through available information (in order to find relevant information) and making specific requests for information were different matters and that the websites were meant for legal researches rather than making specific requests. Indeed, in order to make a specific request one would need to be aware of which particular information is available in the first place.

The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives. Indeed, an increasing amount of services and information is only available on the Internet, as evidenced by the fact that in Estonia the official publication of legal acts effectively takes place via the online version of Riigi Teataja and no longer through its paper version (see paragraph 7 above).

Thus, the Court observes that arrangements necessary for the use of the Internet by prisoners have in any event been made and the related costs have been borne by the authorities. While the security and economic considerations cited by the domestic authorities may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts undertook no detailed analysis as to the security risks allegedly emerging from the access to the three additional websites in question, also having regard to the fact that these were websites of State authorities and of an international organisation. The Supreme Court limited its analysis on this point to a rather general statement that granting access to additional Internet sites could increase the risk of detainees engaging in prohibited communication, thus giving rise to the need for increased levels of monitoring. The Court also considers that the Supreme Court and the Government have failed to convincingly demonstrate that giving the applicant access to three additional websites would have caused any noteworthy additional costs.

Ukraine, no. 72286/01, § § 104-06, 28 March 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 115), and that, where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee’s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Popov, cited above, § 211; Hummatov, cited above, §§ 109 and 114; and Amirov v.

Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 117, 7 November 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 116). Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole.

The police officer had coerced the applicant into signing the confession statement without the benefit of legal advice. He had then issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings on the ground that the applicant had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility, while stating at the same time that the applicant’s involvement in extortion had been established."

He therefore did not have the status of a suspect or a defendant. On 3 January 2005 he had been asked to give an “explanation” rather than been questioned by the police. In those circumstances the participation of a lawyer, psychologist or teacher had not been mandatory. There was no evidence that the applicant had been held in a dark cell before the interview, and he had had to wait no more than ten minutes for an officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate to arrive and interview him.

However, the applicant had made his confession statement in the absence of his guardian. Nor had a teacher been present. No teacher had been present during the questioning of S. either. Their statements were therefore inadmissible as evidence. Moreover, S. and his mother had not attended the court hearing and had not been heard by the court.

Detention for behaviour correction therefore had no basis in domestic law. Moreover, the District Court had not stated reasons why it considered it necessary to detain the applicant. The mere fact that the applicant had committed an offence for which he was not liable to prosecution because of his age could not justify his detention.

He belonged to a “problem family”; his parents had been deprived of parental responsibility and he was cared for by his grandfather.

In those circumstances, it had been necessary, in accordance with section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act, to place him in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts.

Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Varnava and Others v.

Thus, during the entire period when the grandfather was not the guardian, the applicant appears to have been under the guardianship of the State, and the grandfather had no legal rights to represent the applicant or defend his interests. Since the applicant was released from the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on 23 March 2005, he had at that time only the State to protect his interests.

In particular, in the complaint against the decision of 21 February 2005, which was examined by the President of the Novosibirsk Regional Court on 29 May 2006, the grandfather cited the applicant’s diagnosis and the impossibility for him of being detained in the absence of medical advice. The President of the Regional Court responded in its judgment that the fact that the applicant suffered from various illnesses could not serve as a ground for quashing the decision of 21 February 2005, given that it had already been enforced in March 2005."

Since the only concrete answer he received to that complaint was through the judgment of 29 May 2006 when, in essence, he was told that there was no point in complaining any further as the applicant’s detention had already ended, the Court considers that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the six-month period should be calculated from that date, as further complaints to the authorities would have had no prospects of success.

The first of these – the pre-investigation inquiry, conducted in accordance with Chapters 19 and 20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – was to verify information on an alleged crime and decide whether there was sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed and whether to institute criminal proceedings. The second set – the proceedings deciding on the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre, conducted in accordance with Chapter 3.1 of the Minors Act – did not require a pre-investigation inquiry to be conducted and were not limited in scope to information obtained during the inquiry. Thus, the outcome of the first set of proceedings did not, in itself, constitute a decisive ground for initiating the second set of proceedings, as exemplified in the applicant’s case where only the last two inquiries, out of five, had been followed by the second set of proceedings for his placement in the temporary detention centre, and then because it had become obvious that other preventive measures had been unsuccessful. Hence, the Government found no grounds for treating the two sets of proceedings as a single process, as the Chamber had done in its judgment, and argued that the applicant’s complaints under Article 6 should be examined separately in respect of each set of proceedings in question."

The District Court referred at length to the witness statements made by S. and his mother in its judgment, and relied on those and the pre-investigation inquiry’s findings when making its ruling (see paragraph 27 above).

Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 116, 29 November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee’s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention (see Khudobin, cited above, § 83 ), that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, § § 104-06, 28 March 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 115), and that, where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee’s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Popov, cited above, § 211; Hummatov, cited above, §§ 109 and 114; and Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, § 93, 27 November 2014 ). The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Holomiov v. Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 117, 7 November 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, § 116). Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Cara-Damiani v. Italy, no. 2447/05, § 66, 7 February 2012)."

                "138. On the whole, the Court reserves sufficient flexibility in defining the required standard of health care, deciding it on a case-by-case basis. That standard should be “compatible with the human dignity” of a detainee, but should also take into account “the practical demands of imprisonment” (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 140, 22 December 2008). When dealing with children, the Court considers that, in line with established international law, the health of juveniles deprived of their liberty shall be safeguarded according to recognised medical standards applicable to juveniles in the wider community (see, for example, Rules 57, 62.2, 62.5, 69.2, and 73 (d) of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures, Article 3 § 3 of the CRC, and Rules 49-53 of the Havana Rules in paragraphs 79, 81 and 87 above). The authorities should always be guided by the child’s best interests, and the child should be guaranteed proper care and protection. Moreover, if the authorities are considering depriving a child of his or her liberty, a medical assessment should be made of the child’s state of health to determine whether or not he or she can be placed in a juvenile detention centre."

                "139. The Court further stresses that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, with further references; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 121, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; Amirov, cited above, § 80; and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 121, 10 January 2012)."

                "140. In this connection it should be noted that the Court has held that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation). According to the Court’s case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, damage and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Amirov, cited above, § 92 ). In the absence of such an explanation the Court can draw inferences that may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see, for instance, Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 274, 18 June 2002, and Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, § 161, 5 June 2012).",

However, the great majority of these documents date from 2008 to 2014, several years after the applicant’s stay at the temporary detention centre and, consequently, do not shed light on the conditions in the centre during his placement there. Moreover, as concerns the report by the head of the temporary detention centre, dated 28 December 2010, and the explanation of a supervisor at the centre, dated 23 December 2010, the Court finds it unlikely that they would remember whether or not one child, who had stayed at the temporary detention centre for thirty days almost six years earlier, had complained of the conditions or access to the toilets. It has also on previous occasions found that reports or certificates like those submitted by the Russian Government were of little evidentiary value as they lacked references to original documentation held by the relevant prison or detention centre (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 124, with further references)."

At that time, medication was prescribed for him, as well as regular supervision by a neurologist and a psychiatrist and regular psychological counselling for his ADHD. It has further been established through medical records that the applicant was hospitalised the day after his release from the temporary detention centre and treated for neurosis and ADHD. He remained in hospital at least until 12 April 2005, thus for approximately three weeks."

In this connection, the Court observes that an officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate was present at the hearing on 21 February 2005 and that, in accordance with section 31.2 of the Minors Act, a representative of the temporary detention centre was also required to be present. Since the applicant’s grandfather drew attention to the applicant’s medical condition during the hearing, the relevant authorities responsible for the applicant’s placement at the temporary detention centre were made aware of his condition."

Moreover, the fact that he was hospitalised the day after his release, and kept in the psychiatric hospital for almost three weeks, provides an indication that he was not given the necessary treatment for his condition at the temporary detention centre. The applicant has thereby provided the Court with a prima facie case of lack of adequate medical treatment. Having regard to the considerations set out above (see paragraphs 142-43 above) concerning the documents submitted by the Government and the lack of any other convincing evidence, the Court finds that the Government have failed to show that the applicant received the medical care required by his condition during his stay at the temporary detention centre where he was kept for thirty days without the right to leave and entirely under the control and responsibility of the staff at the centre. In these circumstances, the authorities were under an obligation to safeguard the applicant’s dignity and well-being, and are responsible under the Convention for the treatment he experienced (see M.S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 44)."

Thus, in the Court’s view, the applicant has not submitted sufficient prima facie evidence to show whether and, if so, to what extent he suffered from enuresis on admission to the temporary detention centre and whether the personnel at the centre were, or should have been, aware of it.

Moreover, domestic law did not provide for any educational activities in the centres.

This is also supported by international instruments dealing with the deprivation of liberty of minors (see, for instance, Rules 77, 78.3 and 78.5 of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions and measures; Guidelines 21 and 28 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice; Rule 26.2 of the Beijing Rules; and Rule 38 of the Havana Rules. All of these sources are cited above in paragraphs 79, 80, 86 and 87 respectively). Consequently, while the Court accepts that some schooling was provided in the centre, it considers that this does not substantiate the Government’s argument that the applicant’s placement was “for the purpose” of educational supervision. On the contrary, the centre was characterised by its disciplinary regime rather than by the schooling provided."

                "171. The Court further considers it to be of importance that none of the domestic courts examining the applicant’s detention order stated that the placement was for educational purposes. Instead, they referred to “behaviour correction” and the need to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts, neither of which is a valid ground covered by Article 5 § 1 (d) of the Convention. In fact, the Court observes that the purpose of “behaviour correction” coincides with the aims of criminal punishment found in Article 43 § 2 of the Criminal Code and in Article 87 § 2 of the Code for minors between 14 and 18 years of age (see paragraphs 57-58 above)."

In this connection they noted that the Chamber had already examined another court hearing, namely that of 11 April 2005 relating to the applicant’s appeal against his placement in the temporary detention centre, for compliance with Article 5 § 4.

They further reiterated that the pre-investigation inquiry concerned only the establishment of the facts and could not lead to the imposition of any punishment and thus did not involve the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The inquiry could only lead to a decision whether or not to institute criminal proceedings. Since the applicant was under the age of criminal responsibility, the institution of criminal proceedings was excluded. Thus, as in the situation of a mentally ill defendant, the possibility of conviction was completely excluded. Referring to Kerr v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 63356/00, 23 September 2003) and Antoine v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 62960/00, 13 May 2003), the Government observed that, for exactly these reasons, the Court had found that Article 6 was not applicable to criminal proceedings in respect of mentally ill defendants."

Regarding the proceedings leading to the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre, the Government argued that Article 6, under its criminal head, was not applicable. They referred to sections 22(2)(4) and 31.1(2) of the Minors Act and to the domestic court rulings of 21 February 2005 and 29 May 2006. In their view, these sources confirmed that the purpose of the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre had been to prevent him from committing further offences, by correcting his behaviour, and not to punish him for the latest offence he had committed. Thus, the domestic courts had examined not only the circumstances of the latest offence, but the entire record of the applicant’s anti-social and delinquent behaviour, as well as his living conditions and family situation, and had concluded that he lacked the necessary supervision and that the preventive measures previously put in place had been inadequate. Consequently, the domestic court could not, and had not, established the applicant’s guilt in respect of a crime but had merely assessed the sufficiency of the evidence confirming his commission of an act prohibited by the Criminal Code. This could not amount to a “determination of a criminal charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. Furthermore, the court hearing of 21 February 2005 had been conducted in accordance with the procedure foreseen by the Minors Act, not by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation had expressly stated that this procedure under the Minors Act constituted a type of civil proceedings (finding of 14 May 2013, no. 690-O)."

He contended that his placement in the temporary detention centre had not been aimed at educational supervision but to punish him for the crime he had allegedly committed. In his view, the authorities had used the placement as a measure of criminal prosecution since they were prevented from instituting criminal proceedings against him on account of his age."

                "“139. The Court reiterates that the concept of a ‘criminal charge’ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 is an autonomous one. The Court’s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a ‘criminal charge’ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003 ‑ X).",
                "140. Turning to the present case, the Court observes that, after establishing that the applicant’s actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, the domestic authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings against him because he was under the statutory age of criminal responsibility ... Subsequently, in separate proceedings, a court ordered the applicant’s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days on the ground that he had committed a delinquent act – extortion – and it was necessary to ‘correct his behaviour’ and prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ...",
                "141. The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the proceedings against the applicant were not classified as criminal under domestic law. It has already recognised that States, in the performance of their task as guardians of the public interest, are entitled to create or maintain a distinction between different categories of offences for the purposes of their domestic law and to draw a dividing line between what belongs to the criminal sphere and what does not. By removing certain forms of conduct from the category of criminal offences under domestic law, the law-maker may be able to serve the needs of the proper administration of justice, as well as the interests of the individual, as in the present case for example, by exempting minors under a certain age from criminal liability for their actions according to the level of development of their mental and intellectual capacities. Nevertheless, the legal characterisation of the procedure under national law cannot be the sole criterion of relevance for the applicability of Article 6. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 49, Series A no. 73; Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, § 68, Series A no. 80; Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 83; and Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 45, 30 May 2006). In view of the above, the fact that the proceedings against the applicant were not classified as criminal under Russian law has only a formal and relative value; the ‘very nature of the offence is a factor of greater import’ (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 91).",
                "142. It was not disputed before the Court that the delinquent act imputed to the applicant corresponded to an offence in the ordinary criminal law. Indeed, the decision not to institute criminal proceedings stated that ‘[the applicant’s] actions ... contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, punishable by Article 163 of the Criminal Code’ ... At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the criminal charges against the applicant were not pursued on the ground that he had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility. It is, however, not necessary to decide whether, despite the indisputably criminal nature of the imputed offence, the fact that criminal prosecution of the applicant was legally impossible because of his age removed the proceedings against him from the ambit of the criminal limb of Article 6. The Court will instead concentrate on the third criterion: the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring.",
                "143. The Court observes that under Russian law a minor who has committed a delinquent act before reaching the statutory age of criminal responsibility may be placed in a closed educational institution for up to three years, or in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for up to thirty days ... In the present case, within a month of the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant, the local department of the interior asked a court to place him in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on the ground that he had committed a delinquent act for which he could not be held criminally liable because of his age. Referring to his unruly way of life and previous delinquent acts, the local department of the interior claimed that it was necessary to detain the applicant in order to ‘correct’ his behaviour and prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ... The District Court ordered the applicant’s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days for ‘behaviour correction’, on the grounds that he had not ‘drawn proper conclusions’ from his previous placements in that centre and had committed a further delinquent act ... The Regional Court upheld that decision on appeal, referring to the fact that the applicant had committed a delinquent act punishable by the Criminal Code and to his family situation and poor school performance. It found that his placement in the centre was necessary to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts ...",
                "144. The Court is not oblivious to the fact that the decision to place the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders was taken in separate proceedings which were formally unrelated to the criminal pre-investigation inquiry regarding the applicant. However, taking into account that the domestic courts referred to the fact that the applicant had committed a delinquent act as the main reason for his placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, and that in their decisions they extensively relied on the documents obtained and the findings made during the criminal pre-investigation inquiry, the Court considers that there was a close link, both in law and fact, between the criminal pre-investigation inquiry and the placement proceedings. Indeed, the wording of the applicable legal provisions and of the judicial decisions, both cited in paragraph 143 above, clearly shows that the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders was a direct consequence of the local department of the interior’s finding that his actions had contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion.",
                "145. The Court has already found that the placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders amounted to a deprivation of the applicant’s liberty ... There is therefore a presumption that the proceedings against the applicant were ‘criminal’ within the meaning of Article 6, a presumption which was rebuttable only in entirely exceptional circumstances and only if the deprivation of liberty could not be considered “appreciably detrimental” given its nature, duration or manner of execution (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 126).",
                "146. As already found above, the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders did not pursue the purpose of educational supervision ... The stated purpose of the applicant’s placement in the detention centre for juvenile offenders was to correct his behaviour and to deter him from committing further delinquent acts rather than to punish him. However, the Court’s case-law indicates that it may be necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV, and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 123).",
                "147. The Court notes that the applicant’s detention lasted thirty days and was served in a detention centre for juvenile offenders rather than in an educational institution. As established above, the centre was closed and guarded to prevent inmates from leaving without authorisation. Inmates were subject to constant supervision and to a strict disciplinary regime ... The Court therefore considers that the deprivation of liberty, imposed after a finding that the applicant’s actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion and served in a detention centre for juvenile offenders subject to a quasi-penitentiary regime as described above, contained punitive elements as well as elements of prevention and deterrence. The Court finds it difficult to distinguish between the punishment and deterrent aims of the measure in question, these objectives not being mutually exclusive and being recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties. Indeed, in the Court’s case-law criminal penalties have customarily been recognised as comprising the twin objectives of punishment and deterrence (see Öztürk, cited above, § 53; Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, § 47, Series A no. 284; Lauko v. Slovakia, 2 September 1998, § 58, Reports 1998 ‑ VI; and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, §§ 102 and 105).",
                "148. In view of the nature, duration and manner of execution of the deprivation of liberty which was liable to be, and which actually was, imposed on the applicant, the Court finds no exceptional circumstances capable of rebutting the presumption that the proceedings against the applicant were “criminal” within the meaning of Article 6.",
                "149. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the nature of the offence, together with the nature and severity of the penalty, were such that the proceedings against the applicant constituted criminal proceedings within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. This Article therefore applies to the proceedings against the applicant.”"

The Court would add that it does not agree with the Government’s submission that the applicant’s situation should be treated in the same way as that of a mentally ill defendant. In cases of mentally ill defendants, the proceedings can lead to their being placed in closed institutions for treatment and to prevent them from committing further criminal acts.

Moreover, having regard to his young age, it considered the circumstances surrounding the questioning to have been psychologically coercive.

The LIGA also stressed that the right to legal assistance, referred to in various international instruments, applied from the very outset of a procedure, including the police questioning stage, involving children and those under the age of criminal responsibility. Since children below the age of criminal responsibility were often subject to very paternalistic proceedings on the grounds that the proceedings were not penal but protective, the traditional procedural safeguards were often not applied. That approach was based on the theory of welfare juvenile justice systems which had emerged in the United States of America and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and had been systematically criticised by a number of scholars for its overall paternalistic approach to children, typically suppressing their procedural rights and treating them as objects of care and discipline."

It is essential that a child charged with an offence is dealt with in a manner which takes full account of his age, level of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities, and that steps are taken to promote his ability to understand and participate in the proceedings (see Adamkiewicz v. Poland, no. 54729/00, § 70, 2 March 2010; Panovits v.

The right of a juvenile defendant to effective participation in his criminal trial requires that the authorities deal with him with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, during any questioning by the police. The authorities must take steps to reduce, as far as possible, the child’s feelings of intimidation and inhibition and ensure that he has a broad understanding of the nature of the investigation, of what is at stake for him, including the significance of any penalty which may be imposed as well as of his rights of defence and, in particular, of his right to remain silent ( see Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § 92, 30 May 2013; Panovits, cited above, § 67; and S.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 60958/00, § 29, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV )."

In view of his status as a minor, when a child enters the criminal-justice system his procedural rights must be guaranteed and his innocence or guilt established, in accordance with the requirements of due process and the principle of legality, with respect to the specific act which he has allegedly committed. On no account may a child be deprived of important procedural safeguards solely because the proceedings that may result in his deprivation of liberty are deemed under domestic law to be protective of his interests as a child and juvenile delinquent, rather than penal. Furthermore, particular care must be taken to ensure that the legal classification of a child as a juvenile delinquent does not lead to the focus being shifted to his status as such, while neglecting to examine the specific criminal act of which he has been accused and the need to adduce proof of his guilt in conditions of fairness. Processing a child offender through the criminal-justice system on the sole basis of his status of being a juvenile delinquent, which lacks legal definition, cannot be considered compatible with due process and the principle of legality (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, §§ 45-47, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, relating to the legal classification of recidivism). Discretionary treatment, on the basis of someone being a child, a juvenile, or a juvenile delinquent, is only acceptable where his interests and those of the State are not incompatible.

The Court notes that, although not absolute, the right under Article 6 § 3 (c) of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial (see Poitrimol, cited above, § 34)."

                "198. As regards legal assistance at the pre-trial stages of the proceedings, the Court has emphasised the importance of the investigative stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at trial. Therefore, the Court has held that the particular vulnerability of the accused at the initial stages of police questioning can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. Indeed, this right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. It is further important to protect the accused against coercion on the part of the authorities and contribute to the prevention of miscarriage of justice and ensure equality of arms. Accordingly, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as soon as a suspect is questioned by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced where incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used to secure a conviction (see Panovits, cited above, §§ 64-66, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, §§ 50-55, ECHR 2008)."

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Lucà, cited above, §§ 39-40)."

He was thus well below the age of criminal responsibility set by the Criminal Code (fourteen years) for the crime that he was accused of, namely, extortion. In view of this, he was in need of special treatment and protection by the authorities, and it is clear from a variety of international sources (see, for instance, Council of Europe Recommendations No. R (87) 20 and Rec(2003)20; Guidelines 1, 2, and 28 to 30 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice; Article 40 of the CRC, and General Comment No. 10, point 33; and Rule 7.1. of the Beijing Rules, all cited above in paragraphs 77, 78, 80, 82, 84 and 86 respectively) that any measures against him should have been based on his best interests and that, from the time of his apprehension by the police, he should have been guaranteed at least the same legal rights and safeguards as those provided to adults. Moreover, the fact that the applicant suffered from ADHD, a mental and neurobehavioural disorder (see paragraph 12 above), made him particularly vulnerable and thus he required special protection (see Guideline 27 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice, and Article 23 of the CRC, and General Comment No. 9, points 73-74, all cited above in paragraphs 80 and 82-83 respectively)."

However, there is no indication that the applicant was in any form or manner informed that he had the right to call his grandfather, a teacher, a lawyer or another person of confidence during this period for them to come and assist him during the questioning. Nor were any steps taken to ensure that legal assistance was provided to him during the questioning. The Government’s submission that the applicant’s grandfather was present during the questioning remains unsupported by evidence. Moreover, the Court notes that the confession statement signed by the applicant – the probative value of which must be considered to be extremely questionable given his young age and health condition – did not mention the grandfather’s presence and was not countersigned by him. The written statement signed by his grandfather on the same day could, as claimed by the applicant, have been signed later, after the applicant had been questioned by the police officer, and thus does not prove his presence during the questioning. In this connection, the Court notes that it was marked on the applicant’s confession statement that he had been informed of his right not to make self-incriminating statements. However, that document did not mention that the applicant had been informed of his right to have legal counsel or someone else present during the questioning or that any such person had indeed been present."

The Court has previously found that a systematic restriction on the right of access to legal assistance, on the basis of statutory provisions, is sufficient in itself to constitute a violation of Article 6 (see Salduz, cited above, § 56). Moreover, it is contrary to the basic principles set out in international sources according to which a minor should be guaranteed legal, or other appropriate, assistance (see, for example, Article 40 § 2 (b) (ii) of the CRC, and the comments thereto; Rule 7.1 of the Beijing Rules; and Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (87) 20, point 8, all cited in paragraphs 82, 83-84, 86 and 77 above)."

In fact, he retracted the confession immediately when his grandfather came to the police station, and protested his innocence. In this regard, the Court emphasises that the confession statement, made in the absence of a lawyer, was not only used against the applicant in the proceedings to place him in the temporary detention centre but actually formed the basis, in combination with the witness statements of S. and his mother, for the domestic courts’ finding that his actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, thus providing the ground for his placement in the centre."

At the hearing, the applicant, his grandfather and court-appointed counsel were present, as were a prosecutor and the officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate who had ruled on 12 January 2005 not to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant. From the judgment, it appears that the applicant and his grandfather had the opportunity to address the court and submit documents.

Moreover, as found above, the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the questioning at the police station, which irremediably affected his defence rights. Furthermore, the grandfather also claimed that the applicant had been at a doctor’s surgery earlier on the relevant day. However, the Court observes that neither S. nor his mother was called to the hearing to give evidence and provide the applicant with an opportunity to cross-examine them, despite the fact that their testimonies were of decisive importance to the pre-investigation inquiry’s conclusion that the applicant had committed a delinquent act, namely, extortion."

Moreover, in view of the fact that the applicant had retracted his confession, the Court considers that it was important for the fairness of the proceedings that S. and his mother be heard.

In fact, no efforts were made by the authorities to secure the appearance of S. and his mother in court, even though the Minors Act does provide for the possibility of hearing witnesses, as acknowledged by the Government.

As noted by the Chamber in paragraph 173 of its judgment, the applicant was not provided with an opportunity to scrutinise the witnesses’ questioning by the investigator, nor was he then or later provided with the opportunity to have his own questions put to them. Furthermore, as the witnesses’ statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe the witnesses’ demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, for similar reasoning, Makeyev v.

Instead, the Minors Act was applicable to the applicant. This Act provided for significantly restricted procedural safeguards (see paragraph 68 above) since it was intended as protective legislation for minors. According to the Court, and as also noted by the LIGA in its submission (see paragraph 192 above), this is where, as illustrated by the present case, the legislature’s intention to protect children and ensure their care and treatment comes into conflict with reality and the principles set out in paragraph 196 above, since the child is deprived of his liberty without having the procedural rights to defend himself properly against the imposition of such a harsh measure."

As is clear from the relevant international materials before the Court (see paragraphs 77-89 above), this has been established in many international documents. It has also been emphasised by the third-party interveners. Thus, the Court is convinced that adequate procedural safeguards must be in place to protect the best interests and well-being of the child, certainly when his or her liberty is at stake. To find otherwise would be to put children at a clear disadvantage compared with adults in the same situation. In this connection, children with disabilities may require additional safeguards to ensure that they are sufficiently protected. The Court would point out that this does not mean, however, that children should be exposed to a fully fledged criminal trial; their rights should be secured in an adapted and age-appropriate setting in line with international standards, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child."

The Government insisted that the applicant had been placed in a special unit for inmates with health problems, yet these facilities do not appear to have had less architectural or technical barriers than the facilities in the ordinary wings of that prison. The Court notes that a ramp had been installed to facilitate the applicant’s access to the outdoor yard. Yet other areas, such as the canteen, toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, remained inaccessible for the applicant in a wheelchair, a fact which the Government did not deny. Special arrangements had been put in place to alleviate the hardships of the access ‑ related problems, but only in relation to the canteen and not the other facilities. While it appears that the applicant was not locked up in his cell during daytime and could move around in the living area of his unit, his ability to use any facilities therein was restricted owing to his paraplegia."
            ],
            [
                "158. In this regard, the Court considers that the accessibility of the sanitation facilities raises a particular concern under Article 3 of the Convention (see, in a more complex context, D.G. v. Poland, cited above, §§ 147 and 150). In the present case, the applicant submitted, and the Government did not deny, that his physical disability had prevented him from being able to access the toilets and sauna. While, according to the Government, the toilets had been adapted to the applicant’s special needs, the Court notes that it can hardly be considered as alleviating his hardship, given that these facilities themselves remained inaccessible without the help of other inmates. Moreover, it appears that the only possibility for the applicant to wash himself had been during the weekly sauna visits, facilities which were also inaccessible to the applicant without the help of others. Nor does it transpire from the case materials that the sauna facilities had been adapted for the applicant’s special needs. The Court considers such a state of affairs unacceptable. It has already found that restricting prisoners’ access to showers once a week did not allow them to wash themselves properly and that this shortcoming had contributed to the cumulative effect of conditions of detention in the Prison Hospital in violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Čuprakovs v. Latvia, no. 8543/04, §§ 44-45, 18 December 2012). The international standard in this respect currently stands at least at twice a week (see paragraph 83 above), to which the CPT has also invited the Contracting States to adhere [1]. In the present case, the applicant did not have access to a shower at all. The Court considers that weekly sauna visits did not provide him with an adequate opportunity to maintain his personal hygiene, given their inaccessibility and limited availability (contrast with the above-cited Todorov case, where the applicant had daily access to common showers and later had an en suite toilet and shower)."
            ],
            [
                "159. The Court further notes that the applicant’s special needs were further disregarded as no measures were adopted to alleviate the hardship caused by the inaccessibility of the sanitation facilities while meeting his wife for conjugal visits, which under Latvian legislation could last up to forty-eight hours (see Aleksejeva v. Latvia, no. 21780/07, § 28, 3 July 2012). Acknowledging that the Convention does not require the Contracting States to make provisions for such visits (see Epners-Gefners, cited above, § 62), the Court nevertheless notes that they have to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity. In exercising their wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether or not to allow conjugal visits, the States have to have due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals ( ibid. ). The Court finds that placing the applicant, who is confined to a wheelchair, in facilities where he cannot properly wash and use the toilet, even if only for a limited period of time, could be hardly considered compatible with respect for his human dignity."
            ],
            [
                "160. Turning to the second point in its analysis, the Court notes that the applicant, who has a physical disability and is wheelchair-bound, was in need of daily assistance with his mobility around the prison. While the Court recognises that the administration of Valmiera Prison had made certain efforts to lessen his inability to move about in the prison, the fact remains that he had to rely on the help of his cellmate to enter and leave the living area of his unit; he also had to rely on the help of other inmates to access various facilities, such as the toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, as they were inaccessible to him in a wheelchair. Although the medical staff visited the applicant in his cell for ordinary medical check-ups, they did not provide any assistance with his daily routine (contrast with the above-cited cases of Turzynski, § 40, and Todorov, § 65)."
            ],
            [
                "161. The Court finds that the applicant had to rely on his fellow inmates to assist him with his daily routine and mobility around the prison, even though they had not been trained nor had the necessary qualifications to provide such assistance. The Government argued that the applicant’s cellmate had voluntarily agreed to assist him in case of necessity. The Court is not persuaded by such an argument and does not consider that the applicant’s special needs were thereby attended to and that the State has complied with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in that respect. The Court has already stressed its disapproval of a situation in which the staff of a prison feel relieved of their duty to provide security and care to more vulnerable detainees by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with daily assistance or, if necessary, with first aid (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, § 74, 3 February 2009). It is clear that in the present case the help offered by the applicant’s cellmate did not form part of any organised assistance by the State to ensure that the applicant was detained in conditions compatible with respect for his human dignity. It cannot therefore be considered suitable or sufficient in view of the applicant’s physical disability (see the above-cited cases of Farbtuhs, § 60, and D.G. v. Poland, § 147). While it is true that the Convention does not guarantee as such a right to social assistance, the Court considers that the State’s obligation to ensure adequate conditions of detention includes provision for the special needs of prisoners with a physical disability such as the present applicant (see paragraph 151), and the State cannot merely absolve itself from that obligation by shifting the responsibility to the applicant’s cellmate."
            ],
            [
                "162. In the light of the foregoing considerations and their cumulative effects, the Court holds that the conditions of the applicant’s detention in view of his physical disability and, in particular, his inability to have access to various prison facilities independently, including the sanitation facilities, and in such a situation the lack of any organised assistance with his mobility around the prison or his daily routine, reached the threshold of severity required to constitute degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. There has, accordingly, been a violation of that provision."

They pointed out that he had failed to complain about the decision of 27 November 2001 to a higher-ranking prosecutor; he could have done so either orally or in writing. In this connection, the Government noted that the applicant had been able to lodge a complaint with the doctor of the Prison Hospital around the same time, and moreover that he had been represented by counsel in the criminal proceedings, who could have lodged complaints on his behalf. In any event, the Government argued that the applicant had not complied with the six ‑ month time-limit, since he had lodged his application with the Court on 31 January 2003, whereas the final decision had been adopted on 27 November 2001. It was their view that the trial court could not be considered an effective remedy, considering the lapse of time of almost nine months between the moment the alleged violation took place and the moment the issue was raised before the trial court. The Government argued that even if the trial court had instituted criminal proceedings, they could only have sent the case materials to the prosecutor’s office for a repeated investigation."

Firstly, the decision had contained a reference to section 212 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, which was incorrect since the relevant provision at that time had been section 112. The Government’s reliance on sections 220 and 222 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure was also misguided, since those sections referred only to challenging the actions of investigators and not to refusals to institute criminal proceedings at all. In any event, the applicant submitted that he had not been informed of his rights to complain about the decision. Secondly, at the time the decision had been adopted, the applicant had been in the Prison Hospital suffering from severe pain, and it had been extremely difficult for him to challenge the decision on account of the state of his health. Since the applicant did not consider this remedy effective, he had brought his complaints to the attention of the trial court within the criminal proceedings against him. Referring to the judgment of 4 June 2002, the applicant pointed out that the Jelgava Court had in fact examined his allegations of ill-treatment, but had found the police officers’ statements and the results of the forensic examination sufficient to reject them. The applicant pointed out that under section 257 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court had the competence to institute criminal proceedings against third parties. It was therefore his view that the trial court had been the proper remedy in his case and that he had submitted his application within the requisite six-month time-limit."

They pointed out that the doctors had not established any visible bodily injuries on the applicant’s body. The Government relied on the police officers’ statements, and argued that during his arrest the applicant had been aggressive and drunk. Having seen a gun in his pocket, the officers had pushed him to the ground, had pulled his arms backwards and had handcuffed him. The Government admitted that the applicant’s spine had been twisted backwards extensively and that that a certain degree of force must have been used on him.

The Government noted that, on the one hand, during his questioning on 11 September 2001, the applicant had complained that the police officers had used physical force and that he had sustained bodily injuries as a result. On the other hand, the police officers had denied this during their own questioning and also during their confrontation with the applicant.

Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269), the Court also points out that where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni v.

The Court notes that the Olaine police, as the competent investigating authority at that point in the criminal proceedings, was in charge of two investigations based on mutually contradictory allegations – in relation to the firearm charge against the applicant and in relation to his allegations of ill-treatment upon arrest implicating the traffic police officers who had discovered the firearm. The Court has found in a number of cases against Latvia that minimum standards of an independent investigation have not been respected where the police was charged with investigating allegations relating to its own officers (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 75, 21 December 2010; Timofejevi v. Latvia, no. 45393/04, § 98, 11 December 2012, and Vovruško v. Latvia, no. 11065/02, § 50, 11 December 2012). Bearing in mind that the Olaine police sent the case material to the prosecutor for bringing the firearm charge against the applicant on the 8 th day after the events and that they took no additional investigative steps after the prosecutor sent back the case material in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment for additional review on 5 November 2001, the Court considers it sufficient to note that the investigation by the Olaine police in this regard can hardly be considered showing the necessary diligence for the following reasons."

It is true that both traffic police officers were questioned on the day of the events, and that the following day an attempt was made to question the applicant, who owing to his state of health could not give evidence alleging that he had been ill-treated. However, there were discrepancies between police officer E.Š.’s statement and his own report about the arrest as to where exactly a bullet was found, either together with a gun in the applicant’s pocket or inside the car. The Olaine police did not look into this. It appears that this conflicting statement was not admitted as evidence in the applicant’s trial concerning the firearm charge. Further discrepancies were present in the forensic reports as concerns the place where the bullet was found. These discrepancies were not examined further, which undermines the thoroughness and reliability of the pre-trial investigation. It appears that the investigation by the Olaine police had consisted of a questioning of the police officers and the applicant, and some forensic examinations which did not yield any results.

It remains to be examined whether the above-mentioned shortcomings could, to a certain extent, be counterbalanced by an effective supervision of the investigation (see the above-cited Vovruško case, § 51). The Court refers in this connection to other cases against Latvia, where it has found various shortcomings in the exercise of the prosecutorial supervision at the material time (see Timofejevi, §§ 101 and 103, and Vovruško, §§ 52-53, cited above). In the case at hand, the Court notes that the prosecutor was the same person who brought the formal firearm charge against the applicant and issued the final bill of indictment in that regard (see paragraphs 37 and 45 above). The Court further notes that on two occasions, the same prosecutor rejected the applicant’s request to terminate the criminal proceedings against him on the basis that his guilt had been duly established (see paragraph 46 above). The Court considers that the prosecutor relied to a considerable extent on the statements of the police officers who had been implicated in the events, and fully accepted their denial of having assaulted the applicant, as evidenced by the scarcely reasoned decision to refuse the institution of proceedings. This is sufficient to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the prosecutor’s supervision of the investigation in the applicant’s case, particularly as she did not carry out any assessment of the statements given by the police officers and the applicant, and did not provide reasons why she considered the police officers’ statements more credible.

The Court considers the total delay of two months for ordering and carrying out a forensic examination of injuries sustained by the applicant unacceptable. Nor did the prosecutor ensure that the forensic expert examined the applicant in person (see, for an example of similar shortcomings in an investigation the above-cited Vovruško case, § 49), thereby making it impossible to discover any physical marks or injuries on the applicant’s body, if there had been any and that they could have remained visible two months after the events. The prosecutor also endorsed the forensic expert’s disregard of the first diagnosis made by doctors at the specialist hospital concerning the hyperextension injury because “they were not confirmed by visible bodily injuries”. The Court does not agree that only visible injuries on an individual’s body could serve as a proof of ill ‑ treatment. It further notes that the conclusions made by the specialist hospital (about the broken screws and dislodging of the metal implant) were based on an X-ray of the applicant, which the prosecutor appears to have omitted to take into consideration when examining the case. Moreover, it appears that the prosecutor failed to take any steps to obtain any eyewitness accounts, which could have shed some light on the disputed circumstances of the arrest, given that it had taken place next to an apartment building in a residential area."

The Government further argued that the applicant’s counsel could have lodged a complaint to a higher-ranking prosecutor on his behalf, if the applicant himself was not capable of doing so on account of his state of health. That counsel, however, appears to have been appointed only in the connection with the criminal proceedings against the applicant, and it remains unclear whether she had the authority to lodge any complaints relating to the criminal proceedings against the police officers. There is no information that she was actually informed about the refusal to institute the criminal proceedings against the police officers."

                "118. In any event, the Court considers that the applicant brought his allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the domestic authorities during his trial. The Court reiterates that at the material time pursuant to section 109 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure a court had to accept any material concerning criminal offences and to institute or refuse to institute criminal proceedings, or forward that material to the competent authority (see paragraph 84 above). The Court has already noted that domestic courts had such competence and that that they could forward the complaint of ill-treatment by the police raised during the trial to the prosecutor’s office (see Timofejevi, cited above, § 104). Likewise, the Court has noted that where representations of ill-treatment were raised during the trial in the presence of a representative of the prosecutor’s office, the latter could not remain passive and had to ensure that an investigation was carried out (see Sorokins and Sorokina v. Latvia, no. 45476/04, §§ 98-99, 28 May 2013). The applicant in the present case pursued his complaint before the national courts, but they did not give any credence to his allegations. No official investigation was triggered. The Court therefore considers that the final decision in relation to the applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment was adopted on 2 December 2002, when the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law in the criminal proceedings against him, whereas his complaint to the Court was lodged on 31 January 2003."

It is important to note that when the applicant was placed in detention he could walk; his paraplegia was first recorded in prison and his Category 1 disability was subsequently confirmed by the relevant domestic authority. Had there been any imprecision on their part in establishing an accurate diagnosis of the applicant’s medical condition, or indeed had the domestic authorities subsequently failed to detect any changes in the applicant’s condition, the State would have to bear responsibility for such an omission as it is its obligation to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty receive the requisite medical assistance."

First of all, as concerns the material conditions of the applicant’s detention in Valmiera Prison, the Court notes that it is common ground between the parties that he was detained for nearly two-and-a-half years in a regular detention facility, which was not adapted for a wheelchair-bound person such as the applicant. The Government insisted that the applicant had been placed in a special unit for inmates with health problems, yet these facilities do not appear to have had less architectural or technical barriers than the facilities in the ordinary wings of that prison. The Court notes that a ramp had been installed to facilitate the applicant’s access to the outdoor yard. Yet other areas, such as the canteen, toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, remained inaccessible for the applicant in a wheelchair, a fact which the Government did not deny. Special arrangements had been put in place to alleviate the hardships of the access ‑ related problems, but only in relation to the canteen and not the other facilities. While it appears that the applicant was not locked up in his cell during daytime and could move around in the living area of his unit, his ability to use any facilities therein was restricted owing to his paraplegia."
            ],
            [
                "158. In this regard, the Court considers that the accessibility of the sanitation facilities raises a particular concern under Article 3 of the Convention (see, in a more complex context, D.G. v. Poland, cited above, §§ 147 and 150). In the present case, the applicant submitted, and the Government did not deny, that his physical disability had prevented him from being able to access the toilets and sauna. While, according to the Government, the toilets had been adapted to the applicant’s special needs, the Court notes that it can hardly be considered as alleviating his hardship, given that these facilities themselves remained inaccessible without the help of other inmates. Moreover, it appears that the only possibility for the applicant to wash himself had been during the weekly sauna visits, facilities which were also inaccessible to the applicant without the help of others. Nor does it transpire from the case materials that the sauna facilities had been adapted for the applicant’s special needs. The Court considers such a state of affairs unacceptable. It has already found that restricting prisoners’ access to showers once a week did not allow them to wash themselves properly and that this shortcoming had contributed to the cumulative effect of conditions of detention in the Prison Hospital in violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Čuprakovs v. Latvia, no. 8543/04, §§ 44-45, 18 December 2012). The international standard in this respect currently stands at least at twice a week (see paragraph 83 above), to which the CPT has also invited the Contracting States to adhere [1]. In the present case, the applicant did not have access to a shower at all. The Court considers that weekly sauna visits did not provide him with an adequate opportunity to maintain his personal hygiene, given their inaccessibility and limited availability (contrast with the above-cited Todorov case, where the applicant had daily access to common showers and later had an en suite toilet and shower)."
            ],
            [
                "159. The Court further notes that the applicant’s special needs were further disregarded as no measures were adopted to alleviate the hardship caused by the inaccessibility of the sanitation facilities while meeting his wife for conjugal visits, which under Latvian legislation could last up to forty-eight hours (see Aleksejeva v. Latvia, no. 21780/07, § 28, 3 July 2012). Acknowledging that the Convention does not require the Contracting States to make provisions for such visits (see Epners-Gefners, cited above, § 62), the Court nevertheless notes that they have to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity. In exercising their wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether or not to allow conjugal visits, the States have to have due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals ( ibid. ). The Court finds that placing the applicant, who is confined to a wheelchair, in facilities where he cannot properly wash and use the toilet, even if only for a limited period of time, could be hardly considered compatible with respect for his human dignity."
            ],
            [
                "160. Turning to the second point in its analysis, the Court notes that the applicant, who has a physical disability and is wheelchair-bound, was in need of daily assistance with his mobility around the prison. While the Court recognises that the administration of Valmiera Prison had made certain efforts to lessen his inability to move about in the prison, the fact remains that he had to rely on the help of his cellmate to enter and leave the living area of his unit; he also had to rely on the help of other inmates to access various facilities, such as the toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, as they were inaccessible to him in a wheelchair. Although the medical staff visited the applicant in his cell for ordinary medical check-ups, they did not provide any assistance with his daily routine (contrast with the above-cited cases of Turzynski, § 40, and Todorov, § 65)."
            ],
            [
                "161. The Court finds that the applicant had to rely on his fellow inmates to assist him with his daily routine and mobility around the prison, even though they had not been trained nor had the necessary qualifications to provide such assistance. The Government argued that the applicant’s cellmate had voluntarily agreed to assist him in case of necessity. The Court is not persuaded by such an argument and does not consider that the applicant’s special needs were thereby attended to and that the State has complied with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in that respect. The Court has already stressed its disapproval of a situation in which the staff of a prison feel relieved of their duty to provide security and care to more vulnerable detainees by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with daily assistance or, if necessary, with first aid (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, § 74, 3 February 2009). It is clear that in the present case the help offered by the applicant’s cellmate did not form part of any organised assistance by the State to ensure that the applicant was detained in conditions compatible with respect for his human dignity. It cannot therefore be considered suitable or sufficient in view of the applicant’s physical disability (see the above-cited cases of Farbtuhs, § 60, and D.G. v. Poland, § 147). While it is true that the Convention does not guarantee as such a right to social assistance, the Court considers that the State’s obligation to ensure adequate conditions of detention includes provision for the special needs of prisoners with a physical disability such as the present applicant (see paragraph 151), and the State cannot merely absolve itself from that obligation by shifting the responsibility to the applicant’s cellmate."

            [
                "162. In the light of the foregoing considerations and their cumulative effects, the Court holds that the conditions of the applicant’s detention in view of his physical disability and, in particular, his inability to have access to various prison facilities independently, including the sanitation facilities, and in such a situation the lack of any organised assistance with his mobility around the prison or his daily routine, reached the threshold of severity required to constitute degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. There has, accordingly, been a violation of that provision."

The court considered in particular that, even assuming that the applicant had established to the satisfaction of the court that Judge P. had made the remark in question, there were no objectively justified doubts as to P.’s impartiality as a result thereof. Even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words “thank you” in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence, it had to be noted that the Regional Court, including Judge P., had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self ‑ determination of others. Assuming that Judge P. had indeed made the remark in question, his “advice” had therefore constituted in substance nothing more than the application of the Regional Court’s said findings to a particular case. The remark had further been made in the context of a confidential exchange between the participants in the proceedings in the absence of the applicant. Judge P. could have expected that the applicant’s female counsel would interpret his remark in the above-mentioned manner within that context."

He was suffering from a sexual preference disorder, namely sexual sadism, as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current version (ICD-10); [1] this disorder had caused, and been manifested in, his brutal offence, and still persisted. The court, having regard to the experts’ findings, observed that the applicant had hidden the sadistic motives behind his offence in the proceedings before the trial court in 1999, which, despite some indications of sexual deviance, had then interpreted the offence as an intended rape which had failed. The applicant, who had given diverging versions of the motive for his offence, had only admitted in 2005/2006, during his examination by a psychological and a psychiatric expert, that in his murder he had put into practice intensifying fantasies of exercising power over women by attacking their neck and by masturbating on their inanimate bodies.

In this twin-track system of sanctions, penalties (see Articles 38 et seq. of the Criminal Code) mainly consist of prison sentences and fines, which are fixed in accordance with the defendant’s guilt (Article 46 § 1 of the Criminal Code). Measures of correction and prevention (see Articles 61 et seq. of the Criminal Code) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital (Article 63 of the Criminal Code), in a detoxification facility (Article 64 of the Criminal Code) or in preventive detention (Articles 66 et seq. of the Criminal Code). The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders and to protect the public from them. They may be imposed on criminally liable offenders in addition to their punishment (cf. Articles 63 et seq.). Such measures must, however, be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed, or expected to be committed, by the defendants, as well as to their dangerousness (Article 62 of the Criminal Code)."

Under Article 66 of the Criminal Code, this required, in particular, that the criminal court had convicted the defendant of an offence of a certain gravity (as specified in the law) and that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, the defendant presented a danger to the general public.

The Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions declared incompatible with the Basic Law remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation, and until 31 May 2013 at the latest, under additional restrictive conditions. In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged subsequently, or ordered subsequently under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code or section 7(2) of the Juvenile Courts Act, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether there was a high risk that the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their personality or their conduct, would commit the most serious types of violent crimes or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1(1) of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 85 below). As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of persons of unsound mind in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court’s case-law (see §§ 138 and 143-56 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment). If the above preconditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released."

In its reasoning, the Federal Constitutional Court relied on the interpretation of Article 5 and Article 7 of the Convention made by this Court in its judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above; see §§ 137 et seq. of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment). It stressed, in particular, that the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment and the principles laid down in Article 7 of the Convention required individualised and intensified therapeutic provision and care for the persons concerned. In line with the Court’s findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 129), it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff and to provide the detainees with individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution had no prospects of success (see paragraph 113 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment)."

The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed its constant case-law that the absolute ban on the retrospective application of criminal law under Article 103 § 2 of the Basic Law did not cover preventive detention. The latter was a measure of correction and prevention, which was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender (see paragraphs 100-101 and 141-42 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment). The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., paragraphs 102 and 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of penalty with that under the Convention. Recourse should rather be had to the value judgments ( Wertungen ) under the Convention in a result-oriented manner in order to prevent breaches of public international law (ibid., paragraphs 91 and 141 et seq.)."

The Federal Constitutional Court expressly referred in that context to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, according to which the detention of a person as a mental-health patient would only be lawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention if effected in a hospital, clinic or other appropriate institution (ibid., paragraph 155).",

The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, stated the following in his report of 11 July 2007 on his visit to Germany from 9 to 11 and 15 to 20 October 2006 (see CommDH(2007)14) regarding the issue of what he referred to as “secured custody”, executed in accordance with the provisions applicable at that time:",
                "201. Under German penal law, a criminal who has committed a serious crime such as homicide or rape may be kept under secured custody ( Sicherungsverwahrung ) after having served his/her prison term. A decision on secured custody can only be taken by the court who issued the original verdict on the basis of expert medical advice. The term of custody is indefinite but subject to court review (...). The possibility of imposing secured custody can either be included in the original verdict itself or it can be ordered shortly before the prison term expires.",
                "202. The purpose of keeping a person under secured custody has no punitive element but aims at protecting the general public from crimes the perpetrator concerned is likely to commit. Accordingly, prison conditions are adapted to the specific situation and unnecessary restrictions are not applied.",
                "203. During the visit, the Commissioner discussed the issue of secured custody with several Länder authorities, judges and medical experts. The Commissioner is aware of the public pressure judges and medical experts are exposed to when they make decisions regarding the release of a person who might recommit a serious crime. It is impossible to predict with full certainty whether a person will actually re-offend. Psychiatrists regularly assess the behaviour of an imprisoned person who might act differently outside the prison. In addition, it is difficult to foresee all the conditions that wait for the offender outside the prison.",
                "204. The Commissioner calls for an extremely considerate application of secured custody. Alternative measures should also be considered before recourse to secured custody is taken. The Commissioner is concerned about the rising number of people deprived of their liberty under secured custody. He encourages the German authorities to commission independent studies on the implementation of secured custody in order to evaluate the measure in terms of protecting the general public and its impact on the detained individual.",
                "205. The Commissioner is also aware of proposed amendments which would allow the ex post imposition of secured custody on juvenile offenders in extreme cases. The Commissioner urges the German authorities to reconsider such proposals due to their extreme consequences on juvenile offenders. Alternative measures should be applied in the case of juvenile offenders whenever possible.",
                "206. Furthermore, the Commissioner was informed that persons kept under secured custody regularly experience a loss of future perspective and give up on themselves. This would appear to call for the provision of psychological or psychiatric care. The medical opinion may occasionally be divided on the efficacy of care provided to persons kept under secured custody, yet the possibility of their eventual rehabilitation and release should not be excluded. Accordingly, people held under secured custody should receive adequate medical treatment or other care that addresses their specific situation.”"

As regards the measures chosen by other Contracting Parties to the Convention to protect the public from convicted offenders of unsound mind who risk committing further serious offences on their release, the comparative law material before the Court shows the following. Out of the thirty-two Contracting States examined, ten allow for the application of protective measures entailing deprivation of liberty after a criminal sentence. Half of these States allow for such measures to be ordered after the imposition of the sentence. Such measures are imposed by a judicial body. In most of these States, these measures are not classified as “penalties” under domestic law. Facilities for enforcing such measures are quite varied, ranging from special detention facilities to psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric wards in prison and regular detention centres.",

The Grand Chamber agrees that there is a retrospective element in the order of such preventive detention in that it is a precondition for the order that the person concerned was sentenced in a previous judgment to a term of imprisonment for a serious criminal offence. However, there is equally a strong prospective element in that the order must be based on an ex nunc assessment that it is likely that the person concerned would commit new offences in the future. That prospective element is further reinforced after the changes made by the Federal Constitutional Court and the German legislator to the preventive detention regime applicable to persons such as the applicant. In line with these changes, it is required, in addition, that at the time of the order the persons concerned suffer from a mental disorder, as a result of which they are dangerous to the public."

In view of these strong prospective elements, the Grand Chamber considers that the concept of “nachträgliche Sicherungsverwahrung” is more adequately translated into English by “subsequent preventive detention”, and into French by “ détention de sûreté subséquente ”, thus denominating a measure which is imposed at a later point in time compared to the conviction and which, while having regard to the last conviction of the person concerned, is essentially based on a mental disorder existing at the time when the measure is imposed and rendering the person dangerous.",

The statistical material available (see paragraph 91 above) showed that many of the detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered subsequently had been released since the M. v.

The interpretation of that term was too broad and imprecise. The EPLN noted that according to the Federal Constitutional Court, the notion of mental disorder under German law also covered non-pathological disorders. However, the term persons of unsound mind, or aliéné in the French text, designated persons who were at least in a severe pathological state and whose capacity for assessing the wrongfulness of their acts was non-existent or at least diminished. Moreover, in order to be convicted, the persons concerned had to have been criminally liable at the time of their offence, which was incompatible with the subsequent finding that these persons were of unsound mind."

The EPLN considered that the Bergmann case, to which the present application was a follow-up case, constituted a radical change in the Court’s case-law in that preventive detention which was ordered for therapeutic purposes against a person suffering from a mental illness was deemed no longer to constitute a penalty. In the EPLN’s view, preventive detention executed in the new preventive detention centres in accordance with the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act still had to be classified as a penalty. It was only applicable to persons convicted of criminal offences. It was ordered by the criminal courts. It was aimed at prolonging the detention after convicted offenders had served their sentence. Furthermore, it was executed in centres located on the premises of prisons. Being of potentially unlimited duration, it was one of the most serious infringements of fundamental rights in a democratic society. Its “retrospective” imposition therefore breached Article 7 § 1."

Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142).

However, the order was nevertheless linked to the conviction – and thus “following” the latter – as it was a precondition for the preventive detention order under section 7(2) of the Juvenile Courts Act (see paragraph 56 above) that the young offender concerned had been imposed a sentence of at least seven years for a felony, in particular, against life, physical integrity or sexual self-determination. Moreover, under that provision, the procedure concerning the offender’s preventive detention had to be based on evidence obtained prior to the end of the term of imprisonment imposed for the said offence."

As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court’s findings concerning the notion of penalty under Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition on the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 74 above). It further found that the provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention as they then stood failed, however, to meet the constitutional requirement of differentiating between purely preventive measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, and penalties, such as prison sentences (see paragraphs 70-72 above). The court therefore ordered the legislature to amend the provisions on preventive detention in the Criminal Code so as to reflect that difference."

His deprivation of liberty was thus not effected in an ordinary prison in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention as was the case for the applicants in the above-mentioned M. v. Germany and Glien cases, but in an institution comparable to that at issue in the Bergmann case. He was further deprived of his liberty as a person of unsound mind and was provided with treatment with a view to addressing his mental disorder (see paragraphs 142 et seq. above)."

In that centre, the applicant was being deprived of his liberty under considerably improved material conditions compared to ordinary prison conditions, with a view to differentiating between those two forms of detention, as required by the German Constitution. He was, for instance, detained in a larger cell measuring 15 m² and including a kitchen unit and a separate bathroom and could move more freely within the centre, which provided for rooms and outside spaces for occupational and recreational activities (see paragraph 46 above)."

More importantly, the Court notes that in the Straubing preventive detention centre, as in other such centres (see paragraphs 47 and 81 above), an increased number of specialised therapeutic staff provided inmates such as the applicant with individualised medical and therapeutic treatment in accordance with an individual treatment plan. The comprehensive therapeutic provision for the applicant, addressing his mental condition, now included, in particular, one-to-one or group social therapy, participation in an intensive treatment programme for sexual offenders and therapy administered by an external psychiatrist. The Court notes that it was only after the period covered by the proceedings here at issue that the applicant accepted a part of the treatment offers made to him (see paragraph 47 above). However, the Court does not have any reason to doubt that the treatment offers made to the applicant were adequate, sufficient and available to the applicant at the relevant time. It is therefore of no impact to its findings on the nature and purpose of the applicant’s preventive detention that he did not immediately accept the offers made to him."

Germany (cited above) and the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 responding to it, the domestic authorities have taken wide-ranging measures at the judicial, legislative and executive levels with a view to tailoring the execution of preventive detention to the requirements both of the Constitution and the Convention. Substantive measures have been taken at considerable cost in order to provide detainees in preventive detention with individual and intensive psychiatric, psychotherapeutic or socio-therapeutic treatment aimed at reducing the risk they pose to the public."

The Court attaches decisive importance, in this context, to the fact that under sections 7(2) and 105(1) of the Juvenile Courts Act read in conjunction with the requirements set out in the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011, his subsequent preventive detention could, at the relevant time, only be ordered under a new, additional precondition, namely that he was found to suffer from a mental disorder."

It thus distinguishes the type of preventive detention in the applicant’s situation from preventive detention of dangerous offenders which was not ordered (or prolonged) subsequently. For the detention of this group of persons it is not required under domestic law that they suffer from mental disorders and they are not detained for the purposes of treating such disorders."

The Court does not overlook the fact that also in respect of this group of persons remanded in preventive detention, the link between the measure and the offence(s) in regard of which it was ordered is not completely severed. It remains a precondition for ordering or prolonging preventive detention subsequently that the person concerned was found guilty of a serious offence. However, having regard to the setting in which preventive detention orders are executed under the new regime, the Court is satisfied that the focus of the measure now lies on the medical and therapeutic treatment of the person concerned. The medical and therapeutic provision was central to the specific measures of care provided to the applicant. This fact altered the nature and purpose of the detention of persons such as the applicant and transformed it into a measure focused on the medical and therapeutic treatment of persons with a criminal history (cf. also Bergmann, cited above, §§ 164-177)."

Germany, cited above, §§ 124-32), “ordinary” preventive detention which is not executed with a view to treating the detainee’s mental disorder, even if implemented in accordance with the new legislative framework, still constitutes a penalty for the purposes of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention.

However, the Court takes account of the Government’s argument that the courts belonging to the criminal justice system were particularly experienced in assessing the necessity of confining mental-health patients who had committed a criminal act as they also dealt with decisions concerning detention in psychiatric hospitals under Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 84 above; cf. also Bergmann, cited above, § 178).

Finally, the Court observes, on the matter of the severity of the measure against the applicant, that the preventive detention order against him entailed detention without any maximum duration. It therefore remained among the most serious measures which could be imposed under the Criminal Code. The Court notes in that context that both the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics and the statistics submitted by the Government confirm that preventive detention orders are imposed as an ultima ratio measure. In March 2017, 591 persons were in preventive detention in Germany, a country of some 81 million inhabitants."

Furthermore, his detention was subject to regular judicial reviews at relatively short intervals (see paragraph 64 above). That increased the probability that the measure would not last overly long. The severity of the preventive detention order was alleviated by these factors (cf. also Bergmann, cited above, §§ 179-80)."

The applicant’s preventive detention was imposed because of and with a view to the need to treat his mental disorder, having regard to his criminal history. The Court accepts that the nature and purpose of his preventive detention, in particular, was substantially different from those of ordinary preventive detention executed irrespective of a mental disorder.

Poland, no. 39742/05, § 63, 2 October 2007). The same applies to constitutional courts which decide on the legality of detention and order the release of the person concerned if the detention is not lawful (cf. Smatana v. the Czech Republic, no. 18642/04, § 123, 27 September 2007; and Mercan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 56511/16, § 24, 8 November 2016)."

Where the original detention order was imposed by a court (that is, by an independent and impartial judicial body) in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, and where the domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the Court is prepared to tolerate longer periods of review in proceedings before a second-instance court (see Lebedev v.

                "“The Court reiterates that the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, inter alia, Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 191, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI, and Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 104, ECHR 2013).",
                "... As to the subjective test, the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Morel v. France, no. 34130/96, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 94, ECHR 2009).",
                "... As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Micallef, cited above, § 96).",
                "... It cannot be stated as a general rule resulting from the obligation to be impartial that a superior court which sets aside an administrative or judicial decision is bound to send the case back to a different jurisdictional authority or to a differently composed branch of that authority (see Ringeisen v. Austria, 16 July 1971, § 97, Series A no. 13, and Diennet v. France, 26 September 1995, § 38, Series A no. 325 ‑ A).”",

                "“As regards the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge P. in the present case, the Court observes that the domestic courts examined the case on the assumption that Judge P. could have made the statement in question ... and it will therefore proceed on the basis of the same assumption. It further notes that Judge P. made the impugned statement in the course of a confidential exchange between the judges of the Regional Court and the applicant’s two defence lawyers. That discussion, which took place just after the Regional Court had delivered its first judgment ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention on 22 June 2009, concerned the applicant’s possible future transfer to a psychiatric hospital. It appears uncontested between the parties, and the Court agrees with that interpretation, that the remark allegedly made by Judge P. within that context to the effect that the applicant’s female counsel should be careful that the applicant would not visit and “thank” her when released was to be understood as meaning that Judge P. considered that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a serious violent or sexual offence against his lawyer (similar to the one he had been found guilty of) if released.",

In determining whether it was established in view of this alleged remark that Judge P. was personally prejudiced against the applicant (see the above-mentioned “subjective test”), the Court attaches decisive weight to the context in which Judge P.’s statement was made. Assuming, as the national courts did, that he actually made the alleged remark, he did so immediately after the Regional Court, of which he was a member, had ordered the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention as it considered that the applicant was still suffering from violent sexual fantasies and that there was a high risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences, including murder for sexual gratification, if released .... In these circumstances, Judge P.’s alleged remark amounted in substance to a confirmation of the Regional Court’s finding in the judgment it had just delivered. The Court therefore is not persuaded that, even assuming that the remark was made, there is sufficient evidence that Judge P. displayed hostility for personal reasons and was thus personally biased against the applicant.",

                "... The Court, having regard to its case-law ..., considers that the mere fact that Judge P. had already been a member of the bench which had made the first order for the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention and moreover, following the quashing of that judgment, had been a member of the bench ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention anew on 3 August 2012, did not suffice to raise objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality.",
                "... The Court further finds that the fact that Judge P., in his impugned remark, allegedly confirmed that he considered the applicant to be dangerous on 22 June 2009 does not raise objectively justified doubts that the judge lacked impartiality in the proceedings at issue here. In these proceedings, which were terminated some three years after the impugned remark, the Regional Court heard fresh evidence in order to determine whether, at that time and under the law as modified by the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment reversing its previous case-law, the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention had to be ordered. The impugned statement does not give any legitimate reason to fear that Judge P. would not have carried out that necessary fresh assessment of the level of danger that the applicant posed on the basis of the evidence produced and arguments heard in the new proceedings.”"

                "1. The case originated in an application (no. 48787/99 ) against the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Moldovan nationals, Mr Ilie Ilaşcu, Mr Alexandru Leşco, Mr Andrei Ivanţoc and Mr Tudor Petrov-Popa (“the applicants”), on 5 April 1999.",
                "2. The application mainly concerns acts committed by the authorities of the “ Moldavian Republic of Transdniestria” ( the “ MRT ”), a region of Moldova which proclaimed its independence in 1991 but is not recognised by the international community.",
                "3. The applicants submitted that they had been convicted by a Transdniestrian court which was not competent for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, that they had not had a fair trial, contrary to the same provision, and that following their trial they had been deprived of their possessions in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. They further contended that their detention in Transdniestria was not lawful, in breach of Article 5, and that their conditions of detention contravened Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. In addition, Mr Ilaşcu alleged a violation of Article 2 of the Convention on account of the fact that he had been sentenced to death. The applicants argued that the Moldovan authorities were responsible under the Convention for the alleged infringements of the rights secured to them thereunder, since they had not taken any appropriate steps to put an end to them. They further asserted that the Russian Federation shared responsibility since the territory of Transdniestria was and is under de facto Russian control on account of the Russian troops and military equipment stationed there and the support allegedly given to the separatist regime by the Russian Federation.",
                "Lastly, the applicants alleged that Moldova and the Russian Federation had obstructed the exercise of their right of individual application to the Court, thus breaching Article 34.",

                "4. The application was allocated to the former First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court ). The First Section gave notice of the application to the respondent Governments on 4 July 2000. Written observations on its admissibility were filed on 24 October 2000 by the Moldovan Government, on 14 November 2000 by the Russian Government, and on 2 January 2001 by the applicants."

            [
                "6. The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined in accordance with Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. At the final deliberations, Mr I. Cabral Barreto and Mr B. Zupančič, substitute judges, replaced Mr L. Ferrari Bravo and Mr J. Makarczyk, who were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 3)."

At the hearing the Moldovan Government declared that they wished to withdraw their memorial of 24 October 2000, or at least that part of it which related to the responsibility of the Russian Federation.",
                "In its decision on admissibility, the Court held that the questions whether the responsibility and jurisdiction of Moldova and the Russian Federation might be engaged under the Convention, and whether the Court had jurisdiction ratione temporis to examine the applicants'complaints, were closely linked to the merits of the case, to which it accordingly joined them.",

On 12 January 2004 the President of the Grand Chamber decided to invite the respondent Governments under Rule 39 to take all necessary steps to ensure that Mr Ivanţoc, who had been on hunger strike since 28 December 2003, was detained in conditions which were consistent with respect for his rights under the Convention. The parties were invited, in accordance with Rule 24 § 2 (a), to provide information about the implementation of the interim measures requested. Mr Ivanţoc's representative, Mr V. Gribincea, and the Moldovan Government provided the Court with the information requested in letters dated 24 and 26 January 2004 respectively."

In order to clarify certain disputed points and, in particular, the question whether Moldova and/or the Russian Federation were responsible for the alleged violations, the Court carried out an on - the - spot investigation, in accordance with Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention and Rule 42 § 2 (in the version then in force). The Court's enquiries were directed towards ascertaining the relevant facts in order to be able to determine whether Moldova and the Russian Federation had jurisdiction, particularly over the situation in Transdniestria, relations between Transdniestria, Moldova and the Russian Federation, and the applicants'conditions of detention.",

In Chişinău the witness evidence was taken at the headquarters of the OSCE mission in Moldova, which greatly assisted in the organisation of the hearings. In Tiraspol the Court's delegates took evidence from the applicants and other witnesses resident in Transdniestria at Tiraspol Prison no. 3, and from the witnesses belonging to the armed forces of the Russian Federation at the headquarters of the Russian Operational Group in the Transdniestrian region of Moldova (“the ROG”)."

The Court is likewise aware that a large number of relevant facts concern events which took place more than ten years ago in an obscure and particularly complex context, which makes some degree of imprecision about dates and other details inevitable. It does not consider that that in itself can cast doubt on the credibility of the witness evidence.",

Moreover, the Court has no powers to compel witnesses to appear. In the present case, out of fifty-one witnesses called, seven did not appear before the delegates. Consequently, the Court found itself having to deal with the difficult task of establishing the facts in the absence of potentially important depositions."

It should be noted in that connection that the interpretation given by the Russian Government of the term “local administrative authorities ” of the region of Transdniestria, to be found, among other places, in the agreement of 21 October 1994 ( see paragraph 11 6 above ) is different from that put forward by the Moldovan Government, a fact which enabled the “ MRT ” regime to acquire that infrastructure."

His cell was unheated, even in severe winter conditions, and had no natural light source or ventilation.

On 15 August 2001 he cut his veins and set fire to himself and was treated immediately. On 23 August the doctor found his state of health relatively satisfactory. On 24 August a doctor found that the applicant's health was deteriorating and ordered force-feeding. He was force - fed a total of seven times, including on 28 August, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 September 2001. On 14 September 2001 the applicant was transferred to a detainee hospital and he ended his hunger-strike on 4 October 2001. The feeding took place on the basis of Article 33 of the Law on pre-trial detention (see paragraph 40 below) and a special instruction (see paragraph 41 below). That instruction had not been published but it appears that the applicant had known its contents since he mentioned it in his “ hunger-strike diary”.

In response to the Court's request to submit all relevant medical documents concerning the applicant's force-feeding, including the results of any medical tests made, the Government submitted the following documents. Several types of medical investigations of the applicant's health took place after 11 September 2001, including blood and urine analyses, cardiac and other measurements. According to the register of visits by the duty doctor, the applicant's health was satisfactory during most of the period 1 – 21 August 2001. On 23 August 2001 the duty doctor found that the applicant's health was “relatively satisfactory” but considered that he was not sufficiently fit to participate in criminal investigation actions, having complained of general weakness and dizziness.

Similar remarks were made on 28 August 2001, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 September 2001.

He described the process as follows: he was always handcuffed, even though he never physically resisted force-feeding but simply refused to take food as a form of protest. The prison staff forced him to open his mouth by pulling his hair, gripping his neck and stepping on his feet until he could no longer bear the pain and opened his mouth. His mouth was then fixed in an open position by means of a metal mouth-widener. His tongue was pulled out of his mouth with a pair of metal tongs which he claims left it numb and bleeding each time. A hard tube was inserted as far as his stomach through which liquidised food passed into his stomach provoking, on some occasions, sharp pain. When the metal holder was removed from his mouth, he bled, he could not feel his tongue and was unable to speak. The instruments used for his force-feeding were not fitted with single-use, soft protection layers to prevent pain and infection."

On the other hand, the effect of the long period of time (at least one year in 2003) during which the applicant had not been able to have any physical contact with his visitors, the fact that he could only maintain a relationship with them by correspondence and by meeting with them in prison (see paragraph 37 above) and the physical barriers to free discussion created by the glass cabin cannot be ignored (see the findings of the CPT, paragraph 47 above, and the applicant's unchallenged claims regarding the lack of privacy in the five cabins situated next to each other, referred to in paragraph 105 above ).

However, according to the Court's case law, the indications so afforded by the national law have only relative value; the very nature of the offence is a factor of greater importance (see Campbell and Fell, cited above, p. 36, § 71)."

The Court's case law affirms that it has to be borne in mind that misconduct by a prisoner may take different forms; certain acts are clearly no more than a question of internal discipline, whereas others cannot be seen in the same light. Firstly, some matters may be more serious than others. Secondly, the illegality of some acts may not turn on the fact that they were committed in prison: certain conduct which constitutes a disciplinary offence may also amount to an offence under the criminal law. In the circumstance of the present case, it corresponds to a crime of drug abuse under Article 173 of the Croatian Penal Code which comprises also mere possession of the illegal drugs."

However, the fact that the offence in question could have been the subject of both criminal and prison disciplinary proceedings does not suffice for the Court to conclude that Article 6 is applicable to these proceedings. In this respect the Court notes that the national authorities did not institute any criminal proceedings against the applicant, but opted for disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, it is necessary to turn to the third criterion: the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Engel and Others, cited above, pp. 34-35, § 82)."

In this respect the Court notes that at the core of maintaining an adequate prison regime lies the need to impose disciplinary sanctions for breaches of prison discipline. The Court stresses the importance of preserving an effective system of order and control in prison. The sanction imposed on the applicant for a very serious breach of prison discipline did not extend the applicant's prison term (see, a contrario, Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003 ‑ X), nor did it seriously aggravate the terms of the applicant's prison conditions. It restricted the applicant's freedoms in prison for a limited period of time. In the Court's view, this sanction stayed entirely within the “disciplinary” sphere."

Therefore, the applicant's allegation that he had been accommodated in a cell without a toilet was unfounded. The bed sheets had been changed once a week. In the Government's opinion that was sufficient and the applicant's allegations about the dirty sheets were therefore also unfounded. As to the food provided, the applicant's complaint was of a general nature and unsubstantiated. The Government asserted that the food was prepared according to a normal diet. A representative of prisoners was included in drawing up the menu. There had been no complaints from other inmates about the food quality and therefore the applicant's complaint in that connection was also unfounded. As regards toiletries, the Government acknowledged that these had not been provided to the applicant. However, during his stay in Unit 1 of Gospić Prison he had worked and received some income, and therefore had been able to purchase the necessary toiletries. As to the applicant's general complaints about the lack of adequate medical care in prison, the Government submitted that a doctor had been on call every day. As to the applicant's specific allegations that he had not received adequate medical assistance for his injury, the Government emphasised that the medical records submitted showed that the applicant had been seen by a doctor on the same day and adequate treatment had been prescribed. The doctor had seen the applicant again the very next day and three days after the incident the applicant had been sent to a hospital to be examined by a specialist.

Furthermore, in considering whether a treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see Peers v.

The same doctor saw the applicant again the next day. On 20 March 2005 the applicant was taken to the Gospić General Hospital since he complained of backache.

Firstly, some matters may be more serious than others. Secondly, the illegality of some acts may not turn on the fact that they were committed in prison: certain conduct which constitutes a disciplinary offence may also amount to an offence under the criminal law.

As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners ’ correspondence.

Even the ordinary prison regime had caused his health to deteriorate. The fact that he used a wheelchair and had to live in the hospital wing of the prison had aggravated his suffering. Furthermore, application of the special regime had been extended on the ground that the applicant had not participated in the programmes of cooperation with the judicial process (he had not agreed to give evidence against his criminal associates).

                "55. In accordance with the Court ’ s settled case-law, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, § 24, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII; Mouisel v.

Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269 ). To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25, and Labita v.

With particular reference to persons deprived of their liberty, Article 3 imposes a positive obligation on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 94, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Rivière v. France, no. 33834/03, § 62, 11 July 2006 ). Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 87, ECHR 2000-VII, and Naumenko, cited above, § 112 )."

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat ( see Mouisel, cited above, § 40 ), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well ‑ being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, § 76, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 38, 15 January 2004 )."

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, § 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a) the prisoner ’ s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, § 53, 2 December 2004, and Sakkopoulos, cited above, § 39).",

On three occasions, in January 2001 and in March and July 2002, the Naples court responsible for the execution of sentences, on the basis of the medical reports drawn up by the prison doctors, refused the applicant ’ s requests for a stay of execution of his sentence, taking the view that the care provided by the prison ’ s in-house medical service was appropriate to his state of health (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Argenti v.

The applicant was detained in a cell which had an area of about eight square metres and in which there was a television. Also, he had access to newspapers. He was totally excluded from association with other inmates, but during the day he had regular contact with prison staff, e.g. when food was delivered; when he made use of the outdoor exercise option or the fitness room; when he borrowed books in the library or bought goods in the shop. In addition, every week he received lessons in English and French from the prison teacher and he visited the prison chaplain. Also, every week he received a visit from his counsel.

Accordingly, in Brazil MP placed the cocaine in a pallet with green papaya fruits to be imported by the firm..., from which [the applicant] had ordered the fruits.

He knew that PL was a trained gemmologist, but their acquaintance was of recent date and his efforts to ensure that PL's criminal intention was limited to diamond smuggling were poor.

According to the evidence it cannot be excluded that [the applicant] also intended to obtain a commercial profit from [the health firm]. However, having regard to the applicant's knowledge of the discovery of the cocaine and to the police interviews in general, the court finds that [the applicant] should have realised that the investigation theory of the police was that [his established health firm] was only a cover for the import of cocaine, and that any profit from the sale of health products made from papaya fruits was quite immaterial. Furthermore, the court notes that [the applicant's] rather experimental/impulsive way of starting up his firm was suited to strengthen this assumption by the police, and that the applicant should have realised this.",

In some cases this strain may, for a particular individual, prove to have consequences beyond what is generally foreseeable and predictable by the legislator owing to that individual's mental preparedness and life situation in general.",
                "It must be presumed that the legislator considers solitary confinement necessary for the sake of the investigation, particularly in grave criminal cases committed by a group of persons acting in a more organised way, in which the clearing up to a great extent depends on the persons'lack of opportunities to harmonise their statements mutually and with others.",
                "In order to balance the interests of the detainee against the interest of the society in prosecuting crimes, the legislator has laid down provisions on solitary confinement cf. sections 770a to 770c of the Administration of Justice Act. Thus, the use of totally solitary confinement is limited to a continuous period of eight weeks [except for] cases, where the charge concerns an offence being punishable under the law by imprisonment for six years or more, which are not subject to any restriction in time. The charge against [the applicant] for drug offences under Article 191 of the Penal Code satisfies this condition. Under section 770b, the courts must check whether the purpose of the solitary confinement can be fulfilled by less radical measures, and they must ensure that the measure is not disproportionate to the importance of the case and the sanction that may be expected if the person charged is found guilty. Furthermore, under this provision the court must “take into account the special potential strain on the person charged owing to his youth, or physical or mental weakness” when it orders solitary confinement.",
                "In the opinion of the court, the legislator has thus realised that solitary confinement may at worst result in an unintended harmful effect owing to the mental weakness of the person charged. This is attempted countered by imposing a duty on the Prison and Probation Service staff ( kriminalforsorgens personale ), including the prison doctor, to be aware of any danger signals, according to which psychiatric monitoring may prove relevant.",
                "The question of medical monitoring may be raised by everybody who is in contact with the detainee, including counsel, as well as the detainee himself and the prison staff. If so, the judge responsible for a continuation of the pre-trial detention in solitary confinement must decide whether the interest of society in prosecution must give way for the mental wellbeing of the person charged, with particular regard to the risk of permanent mental harm.",

In addition to the specific elements of the case, the court has taken into account the assessments made by the European Commission of Human Rights, the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations (CCPR), the Committee against Torture of the United Nations (CAT), and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe (CPT) on the conditions of solitary confinement in Denmark as well as national deliberations, most recently report ( betænkning ) No. 1358/1998 on pre ‑ trial detention in solitary confinement...",

The same applies as to the effect of the imprisonment on [the applicant's] health.",

                "The research team found that: \"...remand in custody in solitary confinement versus non-solitary confinement involves the risk of harmful effects on mental health\" and that \"...there is a greater probability that those in solitary confinement develop mental problems and are transferred to prison hospitals for mental reasons than those who are not placed in solitary confinement\". (cf. page 164 of document CPT/ Inf (96) 14) However, researchers found no proven link between the length of judicially-ordered solitary confinement and prisoners'mental health.",
                "The report concludes that: \"... the harmful effects of solitary confinement are not in general such as to result in abnormalities in the cognitive functions, e.g. concentration and memory\". (cf. page 165 of document CPT/ Inf (96) 14).",
                "The Criminal Justice Review Committee is currently examining the findings of \"Remand in Custody and Mental Health\", with a view to re-assessing the rules governing placement in judicially ordered solitary confinement. In addition, the same research team is producing a follow-up study, which is to be published in the form of a supplementary report.",
                "56. The CPT welcomes the fact that the mental health of prisoners in judicially ordered solitary confinement has been the subject of a study. However, it feels bound to point out that, during its 1996 visit, a considerable number of doctors, lawyers, prison staff and other persons who have frequent contact with such inmates expressed considerable surprise at the study's principal conclusion. In their experience, prisoners subjected to lengthy periods of judicially ordered solitary confinement frequently exhibited lapses in concentration, memory loss and impaired social skills. These observations were borne out by the Committee's own findings during its second periodic visit. Many prisoners subject to judicially ordered solitary confinement complained of symptoms including anxiety, depression, inability to concentrate, irregular sleeping patterns, nausea and persistent headaches. In one particular case, the delegation's psychiatric expert was of the opinion that symptoms such as impairment of concentration, depressive mood and suicidal thoughts could be attributed to the inmate's lengthy placement in solitary confinement.",
                "In short, notwithstanding the principal conclusion of \"Remand in Custody and Mental Health\", the CPT considers that there remain serious grounds for concern about the effects upon remand prisoners'mental health of being placed in judicially-ordered solitary confinement for prolonged periods.",
                "57. In addition to stressing that all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible, the CPT's 1991 report recommended that the Danish authorities take steps to ensure that remand prisoners were only placed in solitary confinement in exceptional circumstances which were strictly limited to the actual requirements of the case. It also recommended that there be an effective judicial review of placements in solitary confinement and that, where a placement was prolonged, the reasons for such prolongation be set out in writing (cf. paragraph 29 of document CPT/ Inf (91) 12).",
                "In their response, the Danish authorities asserted that Danish law was already in accordance with these recommendations and cited a steady fall in the number of remand prisoners being placed in judicially-ordered solitary confinement.",
                "58. The CPT welcomes the above-mentioned fall. However, the information gathered during the second periodic visit would suggest that - at least in respect of certain types of cases (serious drugs offences, crimes of violence etc.) - the balance between the legitimate requirements of a criminal investigation and the potentially harmful effects of imposing solitary confinement is still not being struck in an appropriate way. As an example, senior police officers, prosecutors and judges with whom the delegation spoke agreed that it would be extremely unusual were solitary confinement not to be sought (and granted) in a case brought under Section 191 of the Administration of Justice Act (which deals with serious drugs offences). It is also noteworthy that a detailed examination of the court transcript of a randomly-selected Section 191 case showed that no specific reasons had been given by the judge for imposing solitary confinement; instead, he had simply cited the statute which authorised him to grant the prosecutor's request.",
                "Furthermore, although it is true that the statistical information which has been supplied by the Danish authorities shows a downward trend in the number of placements in solitary confinement, it also indicates that the average length of solitary confinement has increased. Indeed, in the course of the 1996 visit, the CPT's delegation met a number of prisoners who had been subject to judicially ordered solitary confinement for long periods of time (one for ten months, two for six months and six for three months or more).",
                "59. In the light of the information set out above, the CPT considers that further action is required to ensure that the safeguards in Danish law concerning the placement of remand prisoners in solitary confinement are rendered fully effective in practice. The CPT recommends that steps be taken to ensure that: - prosecutors are reminded that they should only seek a placement in solitary confinement when this is strictly necessary in the interests of a particular criminal investigation; - on every occasion when the question of whether to impose or prolong solitary confinement is raised before a court, the reasoned grounds for the decision which results are recorded in writing; - prisoners are systematically informed in straightforward language of the reasons for their placement in judicially-ordered solitary confinement; - in the context of each periodic review of the necessity to continue remand in custody, the necessity to continue a placement in solitary confinement is fully considered as a separate issue, bearing in mind the general principle that all placements in solitary confinement should be as short as possible. The Committee also invites the Danish authorities to consider introducing a maximum limit on the total period for which a remand prisoner may be placed in solitary confinement.",
                "60. The effect upon remand prisoners of being placed in judicially ordered solitary confinement can be exacerbated by the imposition of prohibitions/restrictions upon their letters and visits. The imposition of such restrictions lies within the sole discretion of the police (although a prisoner may appeal to a court against the imposition of restrictions). In the course of its second visit, the delegation found that the police rarely if ever sought to prohibit letters or visits; however, it was common for remand prisoners'letters to be monitored and their visits supervised. In its report on the first visit, the CPT recommended that the police be given clear instructions on the circumstances in which such prohibitions/restrictions might be imposed and required to state the reasons in writing for any such measures. This recommendation has not been implemented by the Danish authorities, who consider that the Administration of Justice Act already provides sufficient safeguards in this respect.",
                "In the view of the CPT, the current system of police-imposed restrictions upon letters and visits still does not adequately ensure that the measures adopted in a given case will be strictly proportionate to the needs of the criminal investigation involved. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Danish authorities take steps to implement its 1991 recommendation on this subject without further delay. The CPT also recommends that, in the context of each periodic review by a court of the necessity to continue remand in custody, the question of the necessity for the police to continue to impose particular restrictions upon a remand prisoner's visits and letters be considered as a separate issue.",
                "61. As regards the question of activities for remand prisoners placed in judicially-ordered solitary confinement, the Committee was pleased to note that the Ministry of Justice fully agrees with the CPT's view that persons in solitary confinement should be provided with access to purposeful activities and appropriate human contact in order to counteract the effects of being placed in solitary confinement (cf. page 165 of document CPT/ Inf (96) 14). During the second periodic visit, the delegation noted that efforts were being made to achieve this objective in the establishments visited. The CPT recommends that the Danish authorities pursue their efforts in this respect.",

Since the CPT's first visit to the Western Prison in 1990, the establishment has become the reception facility for all of the Copenhagen Prisons (a role previously filled by the Police Headquarters Prison, cf. paragraph 62, above); the Western Prison now has a turnover of between 8,000 and 10,000 inmates per year.

                "According to the existing Danish legislation, only the courts can decide whether a suspect may be placed in solitary confinement and that such a decision requires that certain conditions are met, i.e. that the suspect is remanded in custody because he or she must be prevented from influencing other suspects through other inmates or in any other way. Total isolation was only possible for a maximum period of eight weeks unless the person involved was charged with a criminal offence punishable by six years'imprisonment or more. Furthermore, the principle of proportionality must be observed – hence, if the purpose of the solitary confinement may be achieved through other means of less vital importance, or if the solitary confinement is disproportionate to the importance of the case and the legal consequences to be expected if the suspect is found guilty, solitary confinement must not be used. When deciding this matter, the judge must also take into account the strain, which solitary confinement may put upon the suspect due to the suspect's young age or mental or physical weakness. The Government also pointed out that the number of persons kept in solitary confinement was decreasing significantly over the years and that the conditions to be met in order to keep someone in solitary confinement were among the strictest in Europe;",

It is always possible for the doctor to inform the prison management and in certain cases also the public prosecutor, the inmate's counsel and the courts of whether and to what extent a psychopathological symptom ascertained must be deemed to have been caused or worsened by solitary confinement and what the inmate's prognosis must be deemed to be under continued solitary confinement. Such medical information will form part of the considerations of the courts when deciding whether solitary confinement is proportionate in the case in question;",

There had been reasonable grounds for suspecting that the applicant had committed a very serious crime that might have resulted in prolonged imprisonment, and solitary confinement was necessary to prevent the applicant from impeding the police investigation. Moreover, the applicant himself gave rise to a considerable extent to the duration of the pre-trial detention in solitary confinement by maintaining until 26 September 1995 his false statement, as agreed with the other co-accused, PL, and by fabricating false diary notes in support thereof. The solitary confinement had been lifted as soon as the applicant could no longer influence the investigation, for example through communication with the co-accused in order that they harmonise their statements."

The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162).

However, the absence of such a purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of this provision (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, §§ 67-68 and 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Valašinas v.

The applicant was detained in a cell which had an area of about eight square metres and in which there was a television. Also, he had access to newspapers. He was totally excluded from association with other inmates, but during the day he had regular contact with prison staff, e.g. when food was delivered; when he made use of the outdoor exercise option or the fitness room; when he borrowed books in the library or bought goods in the shop.

                "107. In addition to the medical notes submitted, the Court recalls inter alia the statement provided on 2 October 1998 by the Chief Consultant of the Copenhagen Prisons. He did not question that the applicant was found to be psychotic during the period of psychiatric observation from 8 December 1997 until 19 January 1998, that is more than two years after the termination of the solitary confinement, but underlined that the applicant had not been found to be significantly mentally ill, borderline psychotic or psychotic during the period of detention from 13 December 1994 until 14 May 1996. Moreover, he stressed that the psychiatrist's assessment of the applicant on 18 January 1995 was carried out for administrative reasons only in connection with the applicant's short ‑ term refusal to eat. It was thus not carried out due to any uncertainty on the prison doctor's behalf as to the applicant's mental state, and neither the prison doctor nor the psychiatrist found the applicant's mental state particularly remarkable or even threatened. Before the High Court the chief consultant repeated that none of the highly qualified and well ‑ trained doctors and nurses attending the applicant during the relevant period had noted any signs of mental disorder in the applicant. He pointed out in that respect that the said doctors and nurses had plenty of experience with examining inmates held in solitary confinement and that they knew what telltale signs of oncoming or existing mental disorder to look for when examining such inmates. However, there were no signs that the applicant was characterised by incipient isolation syndrome. The symptoms of this syndrome are difficulties of concentrating, sleeping trouble, disturbed perception of time and space, disturbed interpretation of sensory impulses, depression, possibly with self-destruction and low self-esteem, attacks of anxiety, lack of interest in surroundings. An incipient isolation syndrome may develop into a borderline psychosis, the symptoms being delusions/paranoia, feeling of unreality and into an actual psychosis. When he suspects incipient isolation syndrome, he writes to the prison management about it with a view to forwarding it to the counsel and the prosecutor. In 1998, for example, the witness wrote such letters in thirty ‑ two cases. He did not know exactly how many such letters he had written in 1995, but he has not changed practice in this respect since 1992."

Admittedly, the applicant was not automatically or regularly examined by a psychologist or a psychiatrist. In the Court's opinion, however, such a general obligation cannot be imposed on the authorities, or the detainees for that matter, in order that the States comply with the requirement that persons in solitary confinement are effectively monitored."

Finally, the Court will proceed to examine whether observations made by other persons of the applicant's behaviour during his pre-trial detention in solitary confinement could or should have given rise to the authorities increasing their monitoring or submitting the applicant to further psychological or psychiatric examinations. In particular, the Court notes the testimonies given by the applicant's mother, his cousin, the prison chaplain, and the prison teacher before the City Court in the compensation proceedings (see §§ 48-51). However, none of those four witnesses expressed the opinion that the applicant had developed a mental illness and they did not at any time during the applicant's detention in solitaryconfinement report their observations or their concerns to the courts, the counsel, the prison management, the nurses or the doctors. Having addressed the latter would have been highly appropriate, as will be seen from the statement given by the Chief Consultant of the Copenhagen Prisons as to his general practice of reporting suspicion of incipient isolation syndrome to the prison management with a view to forwarding it to the counsel and the prosecutor."

In this connection, it recalls that international standards allow for a certain degree of latitude relating to the manner in which the separation of juvenile and adult offenders is to be effected, including the placement of juvenile offenders in separate parts of institutions normally designed for adult inmates. This, in itself, does not amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention and the Court needs to assess whether the conditions of detention, taken as a whole, comply with the State ’ s obligation under Article 3 of the Convention (see, for instance, Kuparidze v. Georgia, no. 30743/09, § 60, 21 September 2017).",
                "In the present case, the Court notes that although the applicant was accused of murder, at the time of his placement in prison no. 13 he had not been convicted. As a minor placed for the first time in detention, he was obviously in a particularly vulnerable position. His suspected mental disability (see paragraph 21 above) could only have exacerbated his vulnerability. Nonetheless, he was placed in a cell with five other detainees who had already been convicted at least by a first-instance court of serious offences, such as murder and sexual violence, while one of them had apparently been convicted by a final court judgment for the rape of a minor (see paragraph 24 above). In the Court ’ s view, this situation in itself created the risk of the applicant being abused (see Gorea v. Moldova, no. 21984/05, § 47, 17 July 2007). In this respect the Court notes that under both Council of Europe and United Nations prison rules (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above), untried prisoners should be detained separately from sentenced prisoners."

It was not even clear whether the ill-treatment complained of had taken place. The investigation into the alleged ill-treatment by other detainees had been effective: it had been initiated promptly after the complaint had been made and had been extensive and complete. Witnesses had been heard (including the prison psychologist), and forensic examinations had been carried out; those examinations had not revealed any evidence of the applicant having been ill-treated. Moreover, the applicant ’ s initial failure to report his alleged ill-treatment and his unclear submissions regarding the exact date of the abuse and the identity of the abusers had reduced the efficiency of the investigation."

This positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as to not impose an excessive burden on the authorities to guarantee, through the legal system, that inhuman or degrading treatment is never inflicted by one individual on another (see Premininy, cited above, § 73, and Gjini v. Serbia, no. 1128/16, § 77, 15 January 2019 ). However, it has been the Court ’ s constant approach that Article 3 imposes on States a duty to protect the physical well-being of persons who find themselves in a vulnerable position by virtue of being within the control of the authorities, such as, for instance, detainees or conscripted servicemen ( Premininy, cited above, § 73 )."

This, in itself, does not amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention and the Court needs to assess whether the conditions of detention, taken as a whole, comply with the State ’ s obligation under Article 3 of the Convention (see, for instance, Kuparidze v.

As a minor placed for the first time in detention, he was obviously in a particularly vulnerable position. His suspected mental disability (see paragraph 21 above) could only have exacerbated his vulnerability. Nonetheless, he was placed in a cell with five other detainees who had already been convicted at least by a first-instance court of serious offences, such as murder and sexual violence, while one of them had apparently been convicted by a final court judgment for the rape of a minor (see paragraph 24 above). In the Court ’ s view, this situation in itself created the risk of the applicant being abused (see Gorea v. Moldova, no. 21984/05, § 47, 17 July 2007).

This incomplete information meant that the report, rather than implying that medical evidence could neither confirm nor deny the applicant ’ s allegations, was instead cited as constituting definitive proof that he had not been raped. Moreover, the applicant had mentioned a certain aspect of his alleged abuse (namely that his abusers had shaved him around his anus). However, despite a specific question about that allegation which the proctologist had not answered in his report, the prosecutor did not find it necessary to obtain a clear answer. Indeed, the prosecutor did not find it important to interview that specialist until after the reopening of the investigation in 2013.

Rather, the applicant was accused of committing, during the same set of events of 12 August 2012, three offences against P. The fact that shortly after the two new criminal investigations were started they were joined with the original one (see paragraph 8 above) only confirms that.

Clearly, the prosecutor saw the alleged murder of P. as an important element to be taken into consideration by the judge when deciding whether to remand the applicant in custody in respect of the proceedings concerning the robbery of P. and the destruction of his property during the same set of events of 12 August 2012 (see paragraph 8 above)."

For instance, the Court has considered that the need for confidentiality is essential in respect of a prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings, particularly where such correspondence relates to claims and complaints against the prison authorities. For such correspondence to be susceptible to routine scrutiny, particularly by individuals or authorities who may have a direct interest in the subject matter contained therein, is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client (see Campbell, cited above, § 47).

Here, therefore, the Court’s task is not to review, in abstracto, the compatibility with the Convention of the above procedure, but to determine, in concreto, the effect of the interference on the applicant’s right to respect for his correspondence (see, as a recent authority, Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v.

In assessing the permissible extent of such control, the fact that the opportunity to write and to receive letters is sometimes the prisoner’s only link with the outside world should, however, not be overlooked (see Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 45, Series A no. 233)."

For instance, the Court has considered that the need for confidentiality is essential in respect of a prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings, particularly where such correspondence relates to claims and complaints against the prison authorities. For such correspondence to be susceptible to routine scrutiny, particularly by individuals or authorities who may have a direct interest in the subject matter contained therein, is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client (see Campbell, cited above, § 47).

Monitoring under the rule in Article 91 of the CES was non-selective and routine; it was not limited as to its length or scope. This provision did not specify the manner of its exercise. No reasons were required to warrant its application. The CES made no provision for an independent review of the scope and duration of monitoring measures (see Enea v.

The [first-instance] court gave only a general list of information and documents ..., without specifying which information and documents and when [the applicant] had communicated. As the offences imputed to [the applicant] were continuous in time and spanned the period from 1992-1993 to July 1998, during which period Russian legislation evolved, the determination of these issues is of crucial importance for the case.",

In addition to the detainees ’ cubicles, the cabin contained a 1.5-m wide lobby for two police officers. According to the Government, the applicant was placed in a single-occupancy cubicle on the basis of a written request by the prison administration, in order to prevent him from communicating with other detainees (a copy of that request has not been provided to the Court). The applicant submitted that he was usually placed in a multi-occupancy cubicle with up to eighteen other detainees, who had stood or sat on one another ’ s laps. Even when he was confined to the tiny solitary cubicle, he had had to share it with another person and they had taken turns sitting on each other ’ s laps.

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kudła v.

The Court reiterates that in certain cases the lack of personal space afforded to detainees in Russian remand prisons was so extreme as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq .m of personal space (see, for example, Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 59, 6 December 2007; Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, § § 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, §§ 47-49, 29 March 2007; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44, 16 June 2005 ). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four sq. m per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § § 70-72, ECHR 2001 ‑ III )."

These fittings further reduced the floor surface available to detainees. It is of particular concern for the Court that there existed no partition or separation between the living area and the lavatory which was not equipped with any kind of flush. Such a close proximity was not only objectionable from a sanitary perspective but also deprived the detainees using the toilet of any privacy. This situation must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medicine in full view of his cellmates and the wardens who watched through the peephole."

The Court observes that during the entire period of detention the applicant ’ s access to natural light and air was significantly restricted, to the point of being virtually non-existent. The window in his cell had frosted glass which greatly reduced the amount of natural light penetrating to the inside and required the artificial lighting to be kept on at all times. It appears that the window did not open and that the air only circulated through the mandatory ventilation system. The possibility for outdoor exercise was limited to one hour a day. It follows that for three and a half years the applicant was practically confined to his cell with no transparent window or access to natural air (compare Peers, cited above, § 75). Moreover, the exercise yards could hardly afford any real possibility for exercise, being just two square metres larger than the cells. They were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with the opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. Obviously the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation. In addition, on the days of court hearings, the applicant forfeited the opportunity to go to the exercise yard."

                "131. On the facts, the Court observes that the applicant was transported to the court hearings in standard-issue prison vans on more than one hundred and fifty days. The passenger cabins of those vans were designed for the transportation of twenty-five detainees on a floor space measuring less than nine square metres, which left an area of approximately fifty by fifty centimetres for each detainee. The height of the cabin (1.6 m) was not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van. The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s claim that the applicant was always transported alone further to a special request by the prison administration, because a copy of that request was not produced. The Government did not comment on the total number of detainees transported by prison vans. However, it appears that overcrowding of prison vans transporting prisoners in Moscow was one of the problems reported by the authority in charge of remand centres as a result of an inquiry carried out in 2003 (see the letter of 26 November 2003 from the head of the Moscow Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, cited in Starokadomskiy v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 42239/02, 12 January 2006 ).

The Government admitted that the heating and lighting systems were only operational when the engine was running. Given that there were no windows or other openings giving access to natural light, the detainees remained in darkness – and, occasionally, in the cold – once the engine was stopped. Natural ventilation through the emergency hatches was obviously inadequate on hot days, given the cramped conditions inside the van, and was, moreover, not directly accessible to detainees from within the cubicles."

            [
                "133. The Court observes that the applicant remained in these conditions for extended periods of time on each journey. Admittedly, the Lefortovo prison is located not far from the Moscow City Court and the direct route would have hardly required more than thirty minutes. However, the Government did not refute, or comment upon, the applicant ’ s submission that prison vans called on their way into other remand centres, namely Matrosskaya Tishina or Butyrka, located much farther from the City Court. The detainees remained locked inside the vans during the detours and loading and unloading of other prisoners. The detailed information produced by the applicant in respect of travelling time on specific dates was likewise unrebutted by any relevant documents which the Government must have had in their possession. In fact, a response by the Moscow police department to the applicant ’ s complaint contained an acknowledgment of delays in transportation of detainees (see paragraph 67 above). Thus, whereas it is impossible to establish with absolute certainty the duration of a journey on every occasion, what is important for the Court ’ s assessment is that the time spent by the applicant inside the van was far from negligible and amounted on average to five or six hours per day, and was occasionally as long as ten hours."

                "134. The Court reiterates that the assessment of the minimum level of severity which a given form of treatment must attain if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162, and Kudła, cited above, § 91). The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kudła, cited above, § 92). Thus, the Court has found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant was transported together with one other detainee in a single-occupancy cubicle which measured one square metre. Although the travel time did not exceed one hour, the Court considered such transport arrangements inhuman and degrading, irrespective of the duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § § 118-120, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... (extracts) )."

His suffering must have been further aggravated by the absence of adequate ventilation and lighting, and unreliable heating. Having regard to the cumulative effect which these conditions of transport must have had on the applicant, the Court finds that the conditions of transport from the remand centre to the courthouse and back amounted to “inhuman” treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. It is also relevant to the Court ’ s assessment that the applicant was subjected to such treatment during his trial or at the hearings with regard to applications for an extension of his detention, that is, when he most needed his powers of concentration and mental alertness (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 120)."

In view of the essential link between Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence”, as specified in the latter provision, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 § 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty “after conviction by a competent court” (see Kudła, cited above, § 104, and Barfuss v. the Czech Republic ( dec. ), no. 35848/97, 7 September 1999). Accordingly, the applicant ’ s detention from 16 December 1999, the date of his first conviction, to 25 July 2000, the date on which that conviction was quashed and his case remitted, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 § 3. The Court consequently finds that the period to be taken into consideration consisted of two separate terms, the first lasting from 3 July 1998 to 16 December 1999 and the second from 25 July 2000 to 14 August 2001, and amounted to two years and slightly more than six months in total."

The fact that the maximum time-limits permitted by the domestic law were not exceeded may not be a decisive element in the Court ’ s assessment. As the Court has previously found in other Russian cases, the calculation of the domestic time-limits depended solely on the gravity of the charges, which was decided upon by the prosecution and was not subject to judicial review (see Shcheglyuk v.

Acting in accordance with these provisions, the domestic courts extended the applicant ’ s detention and rejected his petitions for release, relying on the gravity of the charges against him as the only relevant and sufficient ground (see, in particular, the decisions of 5 and 11 September 2000 ). They also occasionally mentioned other grounds, such as the risk of absconding or interference with justice (see the decisions of 1 February and 4 June 1999 ).

This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts – and thus the sentence faced by the applicant – is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence that has so far been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, loc. cit. )."

The requirement that a decision be given “speedily” is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 § 1 cases, Article 5 § 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, § 79, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV).

The possibility of replacing a judge who could “no longer take part in the proceedings” should normally be used only in exceptional circumstances such as the judge ’ s death, serious illness, retirement, and suspension or termination of his judicial function by the judges ’ qualifications panel. However, Russian law lacked clear rules governing the distribution of cases among judges, which left the matter of selection and replacement of judges to the discretion of the court President. A court President had no legal obligation to give grounds for substitutions and replacements. The applicant emphasised that judges were fully dependent on the court President with regard to their career advancement and fringe benefits, which made them reluctant to contradict his or her wishes. In his case, the changes in the composition of the bench had always come unannounced and no reasons had been given.

Firstly, the case was reassigned from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval on account of the former judge ’ s indisposition, the reality and intensity of which is disputed by the applicant. Secondly, lay judge A.A., sitting with Judge Komarova, withdrew for family reasons and was replaced by lay judge A.M.

In the post-admissibility submission they claimed that Judge Koval had been replaced by Judge Komarova because of the former judge ’ s continued involvement in other criminal proceedings.

None of the replaced judges expressed a wish to resign from sitting in the case, was successfully challenged or had their judicial status suspended or terminated.

It transpires in the instant case that two reassignments were explicitly ordered by the President or acting President of the City Court (from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval, and later from Judge Medvedev to Judge Komarova ). As the Court has found above, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which such reassignment could occur. The lack of foreseeability in the application of Article 241 had the effect of giving the President of the Moscow City Court unfettered discretion in the matter of replacement and reassignment of judges in the applicant ’ s criminal case. In this connection the Court emphasises that no procedural safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of the discretion were incorporated in Article 241. Thus, it did not require that the parties be informed of the reasons for the reassignment of the case or given an opportunity to comment on the matter (compare Bochan, cited above, § 72). Furthermore, the replacement of a member of the bench was not set out in any procedural decision amenable to judicial review by a higher court.

Although the applicant referred to this breach in his statement of appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in their entirety. As a consequence, it did not cure the failing in question (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 134, ECHR 2005 ‑ ...; De Haan v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 August 1997, Reports 1997 - IV, §§ 52-55; and Findlay, cited above, §§ 78-79)."

Delays in the proceedings had been mainly attributable to the domestic authorities. The pre-trial investigation had lasted more than one year and the first hearing had been postponed for almost two months because the judge had been on leave. It had taken the Supreme Court almost seven months to examine the first appeal; in the second appeal proceedings, the file had been sent from the City Court to the Supreme Court almost four months after the conviction, and its subsequent examination had lasted five months. Furthermore, arbitrary changes of the bench had been, to a significant extent, responsible for delays because every replacement of the presiding judge or lay judge required an examination de novo.

Bulgaria (no. 33977/96, § 116, 26 July 2001), the applicant noted that the delay caused by the substitution of a lay judge on 31 July 2001 could have been avoided, had the court appointed a substitute lay judge on 20 July 2001 as his defence had proposed."

On both occasions the appeal issues were decided in a single hearing. The remaining period of approximately two and a half years – the one-year pre-trial investigation having been deduced from the overall duration – was occasioned by delays of various kinds attributable to the Russian authorities.

In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice (see Bulut v.

After the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of the Custody Act which granted the authority in charge of the criminal case discretion in the matter of meetings with counsel (see paragraph 92 above), counsel for the applicant obtained an unrestricted permit; however, by that time the conviction had already been upheld in the final instance.

Under these circumstances the prosecuting authority enjoyed unrestricted access to the applicant for its own purposes but exercised full and effective control over his contacts with the defence counsel, who were required to apply for a permit from the investigator – an officer of the Federal Security Service – each time they wished to visit him in the remand centre. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s assertion that at no point in the proceedings was permission for a visit by counsel unreasonably withheld. Nevertheless, it has no doubt that the need to apply for an individual permit for every visit created considerable practical difficulties in the exercise of the rights of the defence because it detracted time and effort from pursuing the defence team ’ s substantive mission. What causes the Court still greater concern is that this arrangement put the defence in a position of dependence on, and subordination to, the discretion of the prosecution and therefore destroyed the appearance of the equality of arms. On several occasions the Federal Security Service abused the dominant position it had in the matter by refusing to accept Mrs Moskalenko ’ s request for an unrestricted permit or threatening criminal prosecution against her in the absence of any evidence that the permit had been forged (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above)."

Nothing in the text of section 18 of the Custody Act suggests that a mandate from the legal services office and an identity document were not sufficient for allowing visits to the applicant by professional advocates, which all of the applicant ’ s legal representatives were. Whereas section 18 explicitly requires consent by the competent authority for a family visit, it does not mention that visits by counsel may be subordinate to any such consent.

They did not explain why the domestic authorities had not been able to present the bill of indictment in such a way that the classified information be contained in a separate annex, which would have then been the only part with restricted access. Likewise, it does not appear that the Russian authorities considered separating the case materials constituting State secrets from all the other materials, such as for instance, the courts ’ procedural decisions, to which access should in principle be unrestricted. Finally, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant and his defence team could not remove their own notes in order to show them to an expert or use them for any other purpose effectively prevented them from using the information contained in them, since they had then to rely solely on their recollections (see Matyjek, cited above, § 59, and Luboch v.

By a ruling of 20 December 1995, the Constitutional Court had confirmed that the establishment of criminal sanctions for communication of State or military secret to a foreign State was compatible with the Constitution. The terminological difference between the initial wording of section 5 of the State Secrets Act and its text as amended on 6 October 1997 could not justify the conclusion that, prior to the enactment of the amendments, a person could not be held criminally liable for encroachments on the constitutional foundations and security of Russia.

It is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-C, §§ 34-35 and §§ 32-33; and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

The Court observes that the Russian Federation Criminal Code provides explicitly for its retrospective application to acts committed prior to its entry into force if the relevant offence carries a milder penalty than it did under the old criminal law (Article 10). High treason was punishable until 1 January 1997 under Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal Code and thereafter under Article 275 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which defined the offence in a substantially similar way. The sanctions, however, were different: whereas Article 64 laid down that high treason was punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty, Article 275 envisages a term of imprisonment as the main sanction for the same offence. Under both Codes a confiscation order could be imposed as an accessory penalty."

According to Article 276, the offence of “espionage” is not limited to the communication of State secrets to foreign agents but also includes the collection and communication of “ other ”, that is, non-classified, information at the request of a foreign intelligence service."

Thus, it had been established that the applicant had frequent contacts with Mr C., who had been a representative of the South Korean intelligence service. The documents obtained from the KCIA had listed the applicant as a Moscow resident of that organisation. The applicant had copied certain work documents, as per the list prepared by Mr C., and had transmitted those documents to him. The domestic courts deemed those elements sufficient to find the applicant guilty of the offence of high treason in the form of espionage, having regard in particular to the fact that this offence did not necessarily involve communication of information constituting a State secret. The Court considers that such an interpretation was consistent with the essence of the offence of espionage as defined in Russian law."

In deciding, secondly, whether the domestic courts ’ interpretation of the crime of espionage could reasonably be foreseen by the applicant at the material time, the Court notes that both the RSFSR Criminal Code (Articles 64 and 65) and the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation defined the concept of “espionage” in similar terms. These provisions explicitly referred to the collection of “other information” (that is, not constitutive of a State secret) at the request of a foreign intelligence service. The Court considers that the consequences of failure to comply with those laws were adequately foreseeable, not only with the assistance of legal advice, but also as a matter of common sense (compare Kuolelis and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 74357/01, 26764/02 and 27434/02, § 121, 19 February 2008). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was – as in the present case – consistent with the essence of that offence, must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable (see Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, § 109, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts) ). There has therefore been no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."

Given that the legal characterisation was identical in both situations, the Court does not discern any legal basis to assume that in either case a heavier penalty would be imposed. In these circumstances, having regard to the above finding that the applicant ’ s conviction for communication of non-classified information was not in breach of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine separately whether the applicant could reasonably have foreseen that he would be convicted under the same provision of the Criminal Code for communication of sensitive information which was subsequently found to constitute a State secret.",

The Court is therefore satisfied that the refusal had a basis in domestic law. It reiterates, however, that the expression “in accordance with the law” does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, Lupsa v. Romania, no. 10337/04, §§ 32 and 34, ECHR 2006-..., and Al- Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 119, 20 June 2002)."

However, it fell short of the requirement of foreseeability because it conferred unfettered discretion on the investigator in the matter of family visits but did not define the circumstances in which a family visit could be refused. The impugned provision went no further than implying the possibility of refusing family visits, without saying anything about the length of the measure or the reasons that could warrant its application. No mention was made of the possibility of challenging a refusal to issue an authorisation or whether a court was competent to rule on such a challenge. It follows that the provisions of Russian law governing family visits did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities, so that the applicant did not enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (compare Ostrovar v.

The regime at issue restricted the number of family visits to not more than two per month and provided for prisoners ’ separation from visitors by a glass partition. Taking into account the specific nature of the phenomenon of Mafia-type organised crime, in which family relations often play a crucial role, the Court noted that the special regime was instrumental in curtailing the contacts of imprisoned Mafia members with the outside world and preventing them from organising and procuring the commission of crimes both inside and outside their prisons. This led the Court to accept that in the critical circumstances of the investigations of the Mafia being conducted by the Italian authorities, the measures complained of were necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim (see, among others, Messina (no. 2), cited above, §§ 65-67, and Indelicato v.

The Court notes with concern that the Custody Act restricted the maximum frequency of family visits to two per month in a general manner, without affording any degree of flexibility for determining whether such limitations were appropriate or indeed necessary in each individual case. As regards the applicant ’ s personal situation, the Court is unable to discern the necessity for such stringent limitations on the frequency and duration of family visits. It notes that the applicant ’ s wife was neither a witness nor a co-accused in the criminal proceedings against him, which removed the risk of collusive action or other obstruction to the process of collecting evidence (see, by contrast, Kučera, cited above, § 130; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Klamecki, cited above, § 135). The same can be said of the applicant ’ s daughter, who was still a minor at the material time. Furthermore, the security considerations relating to criminal family links which had been found to be justified in the above-mentioned Italian cases were conspicuously absent in the instant case. In these circumstances, and having regard to the duration of the limitations on the applicant ’ s contact with his family, the Court concludes that they went beyond what was necessary in a democratic society “to prevent disorder and crime”. Indeed, the measure in question reduced the applicant ’ s family life to a degree that can be justified neither by the inherent limitations involved in detention nor by the pursuance of the legitimate aim relied on by the Government. The Court therefore holds that the authorities failed to maintain a fair balance of proportionality between the means employed and the aim they sought to achieve."

The wording which could be considered as authorising such a measure in remand centres could be found in the Internal Rules for Remand Centres of the Ministry of Justice (paragraph 147 of order no. 148 of 12 May 2000). However, these provisions were not applicable in the applicant ’ s case because at that time the Lefortovo remand centre was outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and under the management of the Federal Security Service. Although comparable provisions might be contained in the rules for the remand centres under the jurisdiction of the Federal Security Service, such rules – assuming they had been adopted as required by section 16 of the Custody Act – were never published or made otherwise publicly accessible.

Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 117, 19 June 2007 ). As the Court has found above, in the present case there were no security considerations warranting the application of such restrictions. In addition, the Court notes that the applicant was denied any physical contact with his visitors for the entire duration of his detention, that is, for more than three and a half years. The effect of such a long period of time, which must have taken a heavy toll on the applicant and his family, is a further factor weighing in favour of a finding that the contested measure was disproportionate (compare Ciorap, cited above, § 118).

As it has found in paragraph 257 above, this was the only publicly accessible legal provision governing the applicant ’ s situation because the implementing rules for remand centres adopted by the Ministry of Justice found no application in the Lefortovo remand centre managed by the Federal Security Service and because the rules of the Federal Security Service, if ever adopted, had never been made public."

                "266. As was reiterated in paragraph 249 above, the expression “in accordance with the law” also refers to the quality of the law in question which must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. The text of section 20 of the Custody Act provided for censorship of all correspondence by detainees in general terms, without distinguishing between different categories of correspondence, such as, for example, private correspondence and correspondence with legal counsel. The Court has already found that such a form of censorship, which effectively gave the remand prison administration an open licence for indiscriminate and routine checking of all of the applicant ’ s correspondence, was incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention (see Čiapas v. Lithuania, no. 4902/02, § 25, 16 November 2006, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005 ). This reasoning applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case, where the Custody Act afforded the remand centre administration unchecked discretion in the matter of censorship, without defining the length or scope of the measure, the reasons that may warrant its application, or the manner of its exercise, be it opening, reading, stopping, withholding or another form of control. Furthermore, the Custody Act made no provision for an independent review of the scope and duration of censorship measures. The lack of any safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of discretion by the remand centre administration resulted in extraordinary and unusual restrictions imposed on the applicant, such as the prohibition on having more than two photographs in the cell or keeping his letters for longer than twenty-four hours. It follows that the provisions of Russian law failed to afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his correspondence. The impugned restrictions on the applicant ’ s correspondence cannot therefore be regarded as having been “prescribed by law”. In the light of the above finding, it is not necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with."

Where, in the course of the proceedings before the Court, a new legally relevant procedural event occurs which may influence the admissibility of the application, it is in the interests of the proper administration of justice that the Contracting Party should make any formal objection without delay (see, mutatis mutandis, N.C. v. Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 45, ECHR 2002-X, and Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, §§ 39-40, 25 October 2007)."

Having jurisdiction to apply the six-month rule of its own motion (see Sabri Güneş v.

Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 157, ECHR 2009 ). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see Ülke v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 39437/98, 1 June 2004 ). As long as the situation continues, the six-month rule is not applicable (see Iordache v. Romania, no. 6817/02, § 50, 14 October 2008 ). The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, 4 December 2007). The Court found previously that in the situation of a repetition of the same events, such as, for example, an applicant ’ s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court ’ s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court ’ s competence (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, § 75, 17 January 2012 ).

The applicants, who have implied that as a consequence of that situation there were no domestic remedies to be exhausted, ought therefore to have lodged their applications with the Court no later than six months from the cessation of the situation complained of, in order to comply with the six ‑ month rule. By lodging their applications on 5 May 2008 and 2 July 2008, respectively, at the time when the third trial was pending, the applicants complied with that rule in relation to their confinement in a cage during the third trial only. The Court will therefore disregard their confinement in a cage during the first and second trials which ended in 2004 and 2006 – more than six months before the dates on which the applications were introduced – as falling outside the scope of its examination (see, mutatis mutandis, Cyprus v.

In the same period in Russia the number of grave crimes increased by more than 30%, crimes committed by a group by 30% and robberies by 66%.

In addition, defendants were not restricted in their movements by wrist or ankle shackles and were free to take more comfortable postures. The Government stated that preventing any escape attempt on the part of a defendant in custody was safer than arresting him after escape.

They referred to the domestic legal framework for detention on remand, which was meant to be an extraordinary preventive measure to be ordered as a result of the assessment by a judicial authority of individual circumstances showing the existence of a danger of absconding, reoffending or obstructing the administration of justice, and only in respect of persons suspected or accused of having committed the most serious crimes and posing significant danger to society (see paragraphs 6 7 -6 9 above)."

The applicants had not been well ‑ known public figures whose appearance in the courtroom behind a “ security barrier ” could have seriously affected their reputation.

Moreover, the witnesses and the victims had refused to take part in the hearings out of fear of the applicants ’ revenge.

In view of the foregoing, the applicants could not have a fair trial respecting the principle of the presumption of innocence. They had never pleaded guilty and it had been necessary to overcome the jury ’ s prejudice in order to prove their innocence.

During that period there had been nothing to justify those fears, that is, nothing to suggest that he had threatened the victims and witnesses or committed any other unlawful acts against them. In the decision of 8 February 2005 the Magadan Regional Court had imposed on the applicants an undertaking not to leave their place of residence as a preventive measure, which restriction had lasted ten months. The court and the prosecution, which had not appealed against that decision, had not considered that the applicants posed a danger to society. There had been no grounds on which to change that preventive measure to detention on remand on 6 December 2005. Mr Slyadnev had been detained on the same grounds as his co-defendant Mr Grishin. The Court ’ s finding of a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in the case brought by Mr Grishin and, in particular, the finding of the lack of grounds for the witnesses ’ fears, were applicable to the present case (see Mikhail Grishin v.

Nevertheless, under this provision the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kudła v.

The applicants disagreed, arguing, in particular, that the first applicant ’ s full acquittal and the second applicant ’ s acquittal on most of the charges, including banditry and robbery, had confirmed that the charges against them had been unfounded, and that this in any event could not be a relevant argument in view of the principle of the presumption of innocence."

On this latter point, in any event, the Court does not accept that such a threat has been substantiated. It observes that the Magadan Regional Court never assessed whether the applicants ’ physical restraint was at all necessary during the hearings. Moreover no reasons were given for keeping the applicants in a cage. Nor can those reasons be found in court detention orders, contrary to the Government ’ s submissions that the applicants posed a threat to witnesses, and that it was this threat that warranted their detention on remand. The first applicant was not remanded in custody for the duration of the third trial. He was detained on remand in unrelated proceedings for reasons that are not known (see paragraphs 34 and 46 above). The second applicant ’ s detention was ordered by the same court decisions as those which the Court has examined in the case of the applicants ’ co ‑ defendant and found to lack “relevant and sufficient” reasons for detention on remand to be compatible with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, and, in particular, to lack reasons which would show the risk of retaliation against, or pressure on, the witnesses now alleged by the Government (see Mikhail Grishin, cited above, §§ 149-150). That conclusion is fully applicable to the present case, and there is nothing in the Government ’ s submissions to the Grand Chamber which would warrant departing from it. Nor can the accusations that the applicants had committed violent crimes or their previous convictions – some of them with conditional sentences – six or more years before the trial in question, or the first applicant ’ s subsequent conviction, be reasonably considered to support the Government ’ s submissions in this respect. As to the negative references referred to by the Government (see paragraph 96 above), they do not suggest that the applicants ’ personalities were such as to require their physical restraint during their trial; and the second applicant also had positive references from the administrations of his remand centre and prison (see paragraph 44 above)."

Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 105, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV; Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, § 159, Reports 1998 ‑ III; and Şarli v. Turkey, no. 24490/94, §§ 85-86, 22 May 2001 )."

Latvia, no. 61005/00, §§ 171-174, 15 June 2006, and Chaykovskiy, cited above, § 96), the Court has also established that Article 34 of the Convention may impose on State authorities an obligation to provide copies of documents to applicants who find themselves in situations of particular vulnerability and dependence and who are unable to obtain the documents needed for their files without State support (see, Naydyon v.

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 § 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one ’ s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 105, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Nevertheless, Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV, and Kosteski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ”, no. 55170/00, § 37, 13 April 2006). In order to count as a “manifestation” within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, §§ 73-74, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII; Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 78)"

The Court further considers that the measure aimed to ensure the applicant ’ s presence throughout the criminal proceedings and thus pursued a legitimate aim, namely, the protection of public order.

Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003 ‑ I (extracts)).

It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 (see, for example, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ X).",

Each time the domestic authorities noted that the applicant ’ s detention was extended in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure and referred to the existence of reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the risks of absconding and reoffending.

Russia, no. 45100/98, § 106, 8 February 2005). The risk of absconding has to be assessed in light of the factors relating to the person ’ s character, his morals, home, occupation, assets, family ties and all kinds of links with the country in which he is being prosecuted ( see Becciev v.

Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 80-81, 26 July 2001). However, during the period under consideration, the gravity of charges was the only factor for the assessment of the applicant ’ s potential to abscond.

For the Court, the apparent contradiction between the applicant ’ s abiding by the rules of these permissions and the authorities ’ insistence on him being a flight risk was not solved; and the authorities ’ reasoning remained limited to the possibility of a severe sentence, which alone cannot be considered sufficient, after a certain lapse of time, to justify continued detention."

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 § 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one ’ s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 105, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Nevertheless, Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV, and Kosteski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ”, no. 55170/00, § 37, 13 April 2006). In order to count as a “manifestation” within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v.

On many occasions the Court has held that the detention of a person who is ill may raise issues under Article 3 of the Convention and that the lack of appropriate medical care may amount to treatment contrary to that provision (see Sławomir Musiał v. Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 20 January 2009 with further references therein). In particular, the assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment. The feeling of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has (or will be) complied with. There are three particular elements to be considered in relation to the compatibility of an applicant’s health with his stay in detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an applicant (ibid. and Dybeku v.

The last forensic psychiatrist report submitted to the Court indicated that his condition was well controlled on anti-psychotic medication and that participation in occupational and vocational activities at Broadmoor, including attendance at the Mosque, had helped prevent any significant deterioration in his mood. However, the applicant had only limited insight into his illness and would be likely to relapse if he ceased taking his medication. In giving evidence to the First-Tier Tribunal (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Mental Health a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist stated that if he were to be returned to prison, his compliance with medication would be uncertain, particularly in the medium to long term, and this would likely lead to a relapse. The Tribunal subsequently concluded that detention and treatment in a medical hospital were necessary for the applicant’s own health and safety."

Whether or not the applicant’s extradition to the United States would breach Article 3 of the Convention very much depends upon the conditions in which he would be detained and the medical services that would be made available to him there. However, any assessment of those detention conditions is hindered by the fact that it cannot be said with any certainty in which detention facility or facilities the applicant would be housed, either before or after trial. This is particularly the case with respect to the pre-trial period, about which very little information has been provided. The United States’ Department of Justice has given no indication of where the applicant would or could be held, although it has advised that if he consents to his medical records being provided to the United States’ authorities on extradition, those authorities would be able to take his mental health concerns into account in deciding where to house him while on remand. It is also unclear how long the applicant might expect to remain on remand pending trial. If extradited the applicant’s representatives would be entitled to contend that he was not fit to stand trial in the United States on account of his mental disorder. A District Judge would then have to assess his competency and, if the applicant was found to be competent, he could appeal to the Court of Appeals. There is no information before the Court concerning the potential length of a competency assessment or any subsequent appeals procedure, but it is reasonable to assume that the length of pre-trial detention might be prolonged if the applicant were to assert these rights.

In particular, it notes that with regard to detention following a possible conviction, the Department of Justice has informed the Court that after sentencing the Federal Bureau of Prisons would decide which institution the applicant should be housed in. The Bureau would assess the applicant within the first twenty-four hours and if there were concerns about his mental health at that time a doctoral level psychologist would be consulted. In any case, he would be referred to a doctoral level psychologist after fourteen days for an evaluation. If the Bureau held a hearing, the applicant could present evidence and make an oral statement to the panel. In deciding which institution he should be housed in, the Bureau would consider any medical, psychiatric or psychological concerns that had been identified. While his mental disorder would not by itself preclude his designation to ADX Florence, the evidence suggested that most inmates with paranoid schizophrenia were not housed in maximum security facilities (see paragraph 27 above)."

Indeed, it recalls that in Babar Ahmad it was not argued that psychiatric care in the United States’ federal prisons was substantially different from that which was available at HMP Long Lartin ( Babar Ahmad, cited above, § 249). However, the mental disorder suffered by the present applicant was of sufficient severity to necessitate his transfer from HMP Long Lartin to a high-security psychiatric hospital and the medical evidence, which was accepted by the First-Tier Tribunal, clearly indicated that it continued to be appropriate for him to remain there “for his own health and safety”."

Moreover, there is no guarantee that if tried and convicted he would not be detained in ADX Florence, where he would be exposed to a “highly restrictive” regime with long periods of social isolation. In this regard, the Court notes that the applicant’s case can be distinguished from that of Mustafa Kamal Mustafa (Abu Hamza).

As in the community, the vast majority of mental health care in the Bureau is provided on an outpatient basis at the local institution level by the Psychology Services Department working in collaboration with either a full-time or consultant psychiatrist.",
                "Mental health services in the Bureau are delivered by psychiatrists and doctoral ‑ level psychologists. This hiring standard ensures mental health providers in the Bureau have a minimum of four years of graduate level, supervised training in the treatment of mental illnesses.",
                "All Bureau facilities are equipped to manage mentally ill inmates, including those with schizophrenia, as each institution employs doctoral-level psychologists and has access to psychiatric services. Many inmates with mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, are managed successfully in mainline institutions through the treatments of choice which include medication, clinical case management, and cognitive-behavioural interventions. While a diagnosis of schizophrenia would not preclude a designation to a maximum security facility, most inmates with this diagnosis are managed and treated in other facilities. Conditions of confinement are largely determined by security needs and would be modified based on mental illness only if the inmate’s mental status warranted such a change (e.g., if his mental status deteriorated).",
                "The Bureau provides a structured living environment for inmates with significant staff oversight. This environment allows for prompt identification of mental health concerns, provides immediate access to mental health professionals, and facilitates compliance with mental health treatment. All inmates confined in the Bureau are evaluated by Health Services’ staff within 24 hours of arrival. At that time, their medication regimens are reviewed and continued, as appropriate. Thus, any mental health medications the inmate may be taking would be noted and continued as appropriate, upon admission. Additionally, an inmate’s mental health status is evaluated to determine whether there is any imminent risk of self-harm or suicide and whether he or she is stable and appropriate for placement in the designated setting. If Health Services’ staff has any concerns at the time of admission, a doctoral level psychologist will be called to consult.",
                "In all cases, regardless of the outcome of the initial evaluation performed by Health Services’ staff, all new designees are seen within 14 days for evaluation by a doctoral level psychologist. This evaluation focuses on collecting a mental health history, as well as identifying any current symptoms and determining treatment needs. All inmates are classified based on their mental health treatment needs to ensure appropriate placement, treatment, and follow-up services to be provided.",
                "Psychologists are a visible presence in the institution – in the cafeteria, on the compound, and in the housing units. In addition, a psychologist is on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with a prompt response to the institution in the event of a mental health crisis. All inmates have direct access to psychological services from doctoral level psychologists. Ordinarily, these services include: crisis intervention, ongoing clinical case management of mental illnesses, brief counselling focused on a specific issue or problem, individual psychotherapy, and psycho-educational and/or therapeutic groups. Inmates may access these services through self-referral or may be referred by institution staff. In addition, all inmates who need psychotropic medication are seen regularly by a psychiatrist.",
                "On occasion, despite best efforts to work with mentally ill inmates at the local institution level, more intensive mental health services are required. In these cases, an acutely mentally ill inmate is typically referred to one of the Bureau’s Psychiatric Referral Centres for acute psychiatric care. Under Bureau policy, acute psychiatric care is defined as care, including but not limited to, crisis intervention for inmates who are persistently suicidal, homicidal, or unable to function in the institution without creating a dangerous situation due to their mental illness. These inpatient services are generally brief, with the goal of returning the inmate to a level of functioning that would allow him or her to return to the designated institution.",
                "Alternatively, seriously, but not acutely, mentally ill inmates may be placed in one of the Bureau’s residential mental health treatment programs, which provide long ‑ term, intensive mental health care. The Bureau is committed to providing high ‑ quality, evidence-based residential treatment programs to all inmates in need of these services. The BOP’s Psychology Treatment Programs (PTPs) are designed using the most recent research- and evidence-based practices. These practices lead to a reduction in inmate misconduct, mental illness and behavioural disorders; substance abuse, relapse, and recidivism; and criminal activity. These practices also lead to an increase in the level of the inmate’s stake in societal norms and in standardized community transition treatment programs. Transition treatment increases the likelihood of treatment success and increases the public’s health and safety. Inmates are referred to these programs based on need and appropriateness of the program to the inmate’s security level.",
                "Decisions concerning the appropriateness of transfer to a Psychiatric Referral Centre are based on the best judgment of the treating clinicians (i.e., psychologist, staff psychiatrist, or consulting psychiatrist) and are typically dependent upon such factors as the severity of the mental illness, the specific characteristics and resources of the institution, and relevant patient variables. Inmates who are disruptive to the orderly running of the institution, but who are not mentally ill, are not generally appropriate referrals to a Psychiatric Referral Centre.",
                "In the case of schizophrenia, the treatment of choice is medication, clinical case management, and cognitive behavioural interventions, with inpatient admissions only as necessary to manage brief psychiatric emergencies, should they arise. The Bureau attempts to manage and treat the mental illnesses of all offenders in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their mental health and security needs. Therefore, an inmate’s security level would only be adjusted due to schizophrenia should behavioural issues or a psychiatric emergency warrant such an adjustment. The Bureau currently incarcerates many inmates diagnosed with schizophrenia, the majority of whom is managed and treated successfully in general population settings.”"

These meetings are generally referred to as \"team\" and the inmate is present. Team meetings are intended to give staff and inmates the opportunity to discuss issues in an open format. This is the inmate’s opportunity for individual attention and he or she should be encouraged to ask questions and discuss concerns.",
                "Classification is the initial team meeting whereby a careful review of the case and inmate’s history are discussed and relevant programs are recommended. The purpose of the meeting is to define clearly for the inmate: (1) sentence information, including financial obligations; (2) educational programs; (3) security/custody levels; (4) release plans; and (5) work assignments. These programs reflect the needs of the inmate and are stated in measurable terms. Generally, initial classification occurs within four weeks of an inmate’s arrival at his designated institution.",
                "Subsequent team meetings are referred to as Program Reviews. These meetings are held at least once every six months (every three months for inmates with less than one year remaining to serve) and are conducted to monitor and evaluate the inmate’s progress in all program areas. Program participation is discussed in relation to the schedule developed at initial classification. New and/or revised goals are developed as necessary. A progress report is the principal document used by the Unit Team to evaluate the behaviour and activities of inmates. The progress report is a detailed, comprehensive account of an inmate’s case history, prepared by the Case Manager at prescribed intervals during the inmate’s confinement. Generally, the Case Manager composes the progress report with input from other unit staff, work detail supervisors, and education instructors. The progress report reflects the inmate’s past status, assesses his current status, and offers an indication of anticipated accomplishments. This could include the inmate’s continued participation in a program; and what he plans to do at the completion of the program, or if he plans to use what he has learned upon his release. Information is also provided on the inmate’s relationship with others (both staff and inmates), particularly with respect to attitude, punctuality, etc. A progress report is required, at a minimum, once every three years. At the ADX, the inmates are provided with a copy of the most current progress report. Upon request, an inmate may read and receive a copy of any progress report retained in the inmate’s central file.",

Moreover, it found that this conclusion applied equally to extradition and to all other types of removal from the territory of a Contracting State and should apply without distinction between the various forms of ill-treatment prescribed by Article 3 (§§ 166 – 176). However, the Court underlined that the absolute nature of Article 3 did not mean that any form of ill-treatment would act as a bar to removal from a Contracting State; on the contrary, treatment which might violate Article 3 because of an act or omission of a Contracting State might not attain the minimum level of severity required for there to be a violation of Article 3 in an expulsion or extradition case (§ 177)."

With regard to the facts of the case, the Government accepted that there was a real risk that the first, third, fifth and sixth applicants would be detained at ADX Florence if convicted and the Court proceeded on that basis. It found that the physical conditions there – that is, the size of the cells, the availability of lighting and appropriate sanitary facilities and so on – met the requirements of Article 3 (§ 219). Moreover, the Court did not accept that the applicants would be detained at ADX Florence simply on account of their conviction for terrorism offences. Instead, it was clear to the Court that the Federal Bureau of Prisons would apply accessible and rational criteria, and placement was accompanied by a high degree of involvement of senior officials within the Bureau who were external to the inmate’s current institution. Both this fact and the requirement that a hearing be held prior to transfer provided an appropriate measure of procedural protection. Even if the transfer process were unsatisfactory, there would be recourse to the Bureau’s administrative remedy programme and the federal courts to cure any defects in the process (§ 220)."

Moreover, the Court further held that if the applicants were convicted the United States’ authorities would be justified in considering them to pose a significant security risk and strictly limiting their ability to communicate with the outside world. In any case, the Court found that while the regime in the General Population Unit and the Special Security Unit at ADX Florence were highly restrictive and aimed to prevent all physical contact between an inmate and others, that did not mean that inmates were kept in complete sensory isolation or total social isolation. Although confined to their cells for much of the time, a great deal of in-cell stimulation was provided through television and radio, newspapers, books, crafts and educational programming. Inmates were also permitted regular telephone calls and social visits and even those under special administrative measures were permitted to correspond with their families. Furthermore, the Court found that applicants could talk to each other through the ventilation system and during recreation periods they could communicate without impediment. In any case, the Court observed that the figures showed that there would be a real possibility for the applicants to gain entry to step down or special security unit programs. Consequently, the Court concluded that the isolation experienced by ADX inmates was partial and relative (§§ 221 – 223)."

However, it would only be in very exceptional circumstances that the applicant would be able to demonstrate that a sentence faced in a non-Contracting State would be grossly disproportionate (§ 238). In this regard, the Court noted that an Article 3 issue would only arise in respect of a mandatory life sentence without parole and a discretionary life sentence when it could be shown that the applicant’s imprisonment could no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds and that the sentence was irreducible de facto and de jure (§ 242)."

It noted that insofar as the applicants’ complaints concerned the conditions of pre-trial detention, those complaints were manifestly ill-founded because it had not been suggested that prior to extradition the United Kingdom authorities would not inform their United States’ counterparts of the applicants’ mental health conditions or that, upon extradition, the United States’ authorities would fail to provide appropriate psychiatric care to them. The Court also noted that it had not been argued that psychiatric care in the United States’ federal prisons was substantially different to that available at HMP Long Lartin. Moreover, there was no reason to believe that the United States’ authorities would ignore any changes in the applicants’ conditions or refuse to alter the conditions of their detention to alleviate any risk to them.

With regard to the substance of the applicant’s complaint, it is now well-established that Contracting States have the right to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens. However, in exercising their right to expel aliens, Contracting States must have regard to Article 3 of the Convention which enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic societies. It is precisely for this reason that the Court has repeatedly stressed in its line of authorities involving extradition, expulsion or deportation of individuals to third countries that Article 3 prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that its guarantees apply irrespective of the reprehensible nature of the conduct of the person in question (see, for example, Ahmed v. Austria, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2206, § 38, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1853, §§ 73-74)."

Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 20 January 2009 with further references therein). In particular, the assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment. The feeling of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has (or will be) complied with. There are three particular elements to be considered in relation to the compatibility of an applicant’s health with his stay in detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an applicant (ibid. and Dybeku v.

The medical evidence in the present case indicates that the applicant is suffering from an enduring mental disorder, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which has been characterised by auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, delusions of reference, grandeur and guarded and suspicious behaviour (paragraph 22 above). The last forensic psychiatrist report submitted to the Court indicated that his condition was well controlled on anti-psychotic medication and that participation in occupational and vocational activities at Broadmoor, including attendance at the Mosque, had helped prevent any significant deterioration in his mood. However, the applicant had only limited insight into his illness and would be likely to relapse if he ceased taking his medication. In giving evidence to the First-Tier Tribunal (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Mental Health a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist stated that if he were to be returned to prison, his compliance with medication would be uncertain, particularly in the medium to long term, and this would likely lead to a relapse. The Tribunal subsequently concluded that detention and treatment in a medical hospital were necessary for the applicant’s own health and safety."

Whether or not the applicant’s extradition to the United States would breach Article 3 of the Convention very much depends upon the conditions in which he would be detained and the medical services that would be made available to him there. However, any assessment of those detention conditions is hindered by the fact that it cannot be said with any certainty in which detention facility or facilities the applicant would be housed, either before or after trial. This is particularly the case with respect to the pre-trial period, about which very little information has been provided. The United States’ Department of Justice has given no indication of where the applicant would or could be held, although it has advised that if he consents to his medical records being provided to the United States’ authorities on extradition, those authorities would be able to take his mental health concerns into account in deciding where to house him while on remand. It is also unclear how long the applicant might expect to remain on remand pending trial. If extradited the applicant’s representatives would be entitled to contend that he was not fit to stand trial in the United States on account of his mental disorder. A District Judge would then have to assess his competency and, if the applicant was found to be competent, he could appeal to the Court of Appeals. There is no information before the Court concerning the potential length of a competency assessment or any subsequent appeals procedure, but it is reasonable to assume that the length of pre-trial detention might be prolonged if the applicant were to assert these rights. Finally, the Court notes with concern the complete absence of any information about the consequences for the applicant if the District Judge were to find that he was not fit to stand trial."

The Court has given its fullest consideration to the submissions of the Government and the Department of Justice concerning the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in the United States of America. In particular, it notes that with regard to detention following a possible conviction, the Department of Justice has informed the Court that after sentencing the Federal Bureau of Prisons would decide which institution the applicant should be housed in. The Bureau would assess the applicant within the first twenty-four hours and if there were concerns about his mental health at that time a doctoral level psychologist would be consulted. In any case, he would be referred to a doctoral level psychologist after fourteen days for an evaluation. If the Bureau held a hearing, the applicant could present evidence and make an oral statement to the panel. In deciding which institution he should be housed in, the Bureau would consider any medical, psychiatric or psychological concerns that had been identified. While his mental disorder would not by itself preclude his designation to ADX Florence, the evidence suggested that most inmates with paranoid schizophrenia were not housed in maximum security facilities (see paragraph 27 above)."

The Court therefore accepts that if convicted the applicant would have access to medical facilities and, more importantly, mental health services, regardless of which institution he was detained in. Indeed, it recalls that in Babar Ahmad it was not argued that psychiatric care in the United States’ federal prisons was substantially different from that which was available at HMP Long Lartin ( Babar Ahmad, cited above, § 249). However, the mental disorder suffered by the present applicant was of sufficient severity to necessitate his transfer from HMP Long Lartin to a high-security psychiatric hospital and the medical evidence, which was accepted by the First-Tier Tribunal, clearly indicated that it continued to be appropriate for him to remain there “for his own health and safety”."

Moreover, there is no guarantee that if tried and convicted he would not be detained in ADX Florence, where he would be exposed to a “highly restrictive” regime with long periods of social isolation. In this regard, the Court notes that the applicant’s case can be distinguished from that of Mustafa Kamal Mustafa (Abu Hamza). While no “diplomatic assurances” were given that Abu Hamza would not be detained in ADX Florence, the High Court found on the evidence before it that his medical condition was such that, at most, he would only spend a short period of time there ( Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09 (dec.), §§ 144 – 145, 6 July 2010).

Immediately after that a de facto moratorium on the death penalty was applied in Russia: no one has been given the death penalty or executed since 1996. In 2009 the Russian Constitutional Court confirmed the moratorium and held that a constitutional regime providing for firm guarantees of the right not to be subjected to the death penalty had been formed in Russia. It also found that an irreversible process of abolishing the death penalty was underway in Russia on the basis of its Constitution and its international obligations, including Protocol No. 6, which was signed but not ratified by it (see paragraph 51 above). It is notable that the moratorium in force in Russia, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, does not make an exception allowing imposition of the death penalty in time of war."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not make an assessment of the risks of being subjected to the death penalty and receiving inhuman treatment if the applicant were deported to China. Their reasoning on that issue was limited to stating, without reliance on any domestic provision, that the exclusion order issued against the applicant did not automatically entail his deportation to China and that the applicant could still leave Russia for another country. The Court is not convinced by that argument. The Entry and Exit Procedures Act provides that any foreign national who is the subject of an exclusion order and fails to leave Russia as required is to be deported (see paragraph 49 above). The exclusion order against the applicant mentioned explicitly that if he did not leave Russia before the stated deadline he would be deported (see paragraph 19 above). The Court also notes that the applicant ’ s Russian passport was seized and there is no evidence that he possesses any other valid identity document or the requisite visas allowing him to cross the Russian border and enter a third country. In such circumstances, the Court accepts the applicant ’ s submission that it was impossible for him to leave Russia for another country within the three-day time-limit imposed by the exclusion order and that he is now at imminent risk of deportation to China as a direct and inevitable consequence of that exclusion order."

It had been issued by a competent authority in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and had been based on sufficient reasons. Given that the applicant was sought by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of murder, had been fined several times in Russia for driving offences and had lived in Russia unlawfully with an unlawfully issued passport, there were sufficient reasons to find that he represented a real threat to public order and security. The court further noted that the applicant did not dispute the above facts. The thrust of his complaint was that his deportation to China would expose him to a risk of being subjected to the death penalty that amounted to inhuman treatment. Those arguments could not, however, serve as grounds for annulling the lawfully adopted exclusion order. The court also held that the applicant ’ s argument that the exclusion order would automatically entail his deportation to China was unconvincing. Firstly, deportation was not automatic and required a separate administrative decision that could be challenged before a court. Secondly, the applicant had the possibility of avoiding deportation to China by leaving Russia for another country."

The exclusion order alone constituted a sufficient legal basis for deportation and his failure to leave Russia before the stated deadline could therefore entail automatic deportation to China. He did not have any remedies with suspensive effect in such a situation. He further reiterated his argument that he could not leave Russia for another country because his passport had been seized by the authorities and he did not have any other identity documents. Lastly, he argued that his deportation to China would amount to a breach of not only Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, but also of Article 8, because he was married to a Russian national."

Prisoners undergoing this punishment should be visited on a daily basis by the prison director or another member of senior management, and the order given to terminate solitary confinement when this step is called for on account of the prisoner ’ s condition or behaviour. Records should be kept of such visits and of related decisions."

Thus, they should be of an adequate size, enjoy access to natural light and be equipped with artificial lighting (in both cases sufficient to read by), and have adequate heating and ventilation. They should also be equipped with a means of communication with prison staff. Proper arrangements should be made for the prisoners to meet the needs of nature in a decent fashion at all times and to shower at least as often as prisoners in normal regime. Prisoners held in solitary confinement should be allowed to wear normal prison clothing and the food provided to them should be the normal prison diet, including special diets when required.

It is not necessary to have an “all or nothing” approach to the question. Each particular restriction should only be applied as appropriate to the assessed risk of the individual prisoner.

The Russian authorities had then initiated exclusion proceedings, which were purely administrative in nature and did not require approval by a court.

He pointed out that the exclusion order mentioned explicitly that if he did not leave Russia before the stated deadline he would be deported. Indeed, the Entry and Exit Procedures Act provided for an automatic deportation of any foreign national who failed to leave Russia as required (see paragraph 49 above).

                "62. The Court reiterates its general principles as set out in the case of Al ‑ Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom (no. 61498/08, ECHR 2010):",
                "“115. The Court takes as its starting point the nature of the right not to be subjected to the death penalty. Judicial execution involves the deliberate and premeditated destruction of a human being by the State authorities. Whatever the method of execution, the extinction of life involves some physical pain. In addition, the foreknowledge of death at the hands of the State must inevitably give rise to intense psychological suffering. The fact that the imposition and use of the death penalty negates fundamental human rights has been recognised by the member States of the Council of Europe. In the Preamble to Protocol No. 13 the Contracting States describe themselves as “convinced that everyone ’ s right to life is a basic value in a democratic society and that the abolition of the death penalty is essential for the protection of this right and for the full recognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings ”.",
                "116. Sixty years ago, when the Convention was drafted, the death penalty was not considered to violate international standards. An exception was therefore included to the right to life, so that Article 2 § 1 provides that “[n]o one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law”. However, as recorded in the explanatory report to Protocol No. 13, there has subsequently been an evolution towards the complete de facto and de jure abolition of the death penalty within the member States of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 95 above; see also paragraph 96 above). Protocol No. 6 to the Convention, which abolishes the death penalty except in respect of “acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war”, was opened for signature on 28 April 1983 and came into force on 1 March 1985. Following the opening for signature of Protocol No. 6, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe established a practice whereby it required States wishing to join the Council of Europe to undertake to apply an immediate moratorium on executions, to delete the death penalty from their national legislation and to sign and ratify Protocol No. 6. All the member States of the Council of Europe have now signed Protocol No. 6 and all save Russia have ratified it.",
                "117. ... Protocol No. 13, which abolishes the death penalty in all circumstances, was opened for signature on 3 May 2002 and came into force on 1 July 2003. At the date of adoption of the present judgment, Protocol No. 13 has been ratified by forty-two member States and signed but not ratified by a further three (Armenia, Latvia and Poland). Azerbaijan and Russia are alone in not having signed the Protocol ...",
                "119. In Öcalan (cited above), the Court examined whether the practice of the Contracting States could be taken as establishing an agreement to abrogate the exception in Article 2 § 1 permitting capital punishment in certain conditions [:]",
                "‘ ... Equally the Court observes that the legal position as regards the death penalty has undergone a considerable evolution since Soering was decided. The de facto abolition noted in that case in respect of twenty-two Contracting States in 1989 has developed into a de jure abolition in forty-three of the forty-four Contracting States and a moratorium in the remaining State that has not yet abolished the penalty, namely Russia. This almost complete abandonment of the death penalty in times of peace in Europe is reflected in the fact that all the Contracting States have signed Protocol No. 6 and forty-one States have ratified it, that is to say, all except Turkey, Armenia and Russia. It is further reflected in the policy of the Council of Europe, which requires that new member States undertake to abolish capital punishment as a condition of their admission into the organisation. As a result of these developments the territories encompassed by the member States of the Council of Europe have become a zone free of capital punishment.",
                "... Such a marked development could now be taken as signalling the agreement of the Contracting States to abrogate, or at the very least to modify, the second sentence of Article 2 § 1, particularly when regard is had to the fact that all Contracting States have now signed Protocol No. 6 and that it has been ratified by forty-one States. It may be questioned whether it is necessary to await ratification of Protocol No. 6 by the three remaining States before concluding that the death penalty exception in Article 2 § 1 has been significantly modified. Against such a consistent background, it can be said that capital punishment in peacetime has come to be regarded as an unacceptable ... form of punishment that is no longer permissible under Article 2. ’",
                "Having thus concluded that the use of the death penalty except in time of war had become an unacceptable form of punishment, the Grand Chamber in Öcalan went on to examine the position as regards capital punishment in all circumstances :",
                "‘ 164. The Court notes that, by opening for signature Protocol No. 13 concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances, the Contracting States have chosen the traditional method of amendment of the text of the Convention in pursuit of their policy of abolition. At the date of this judgment, three member States have not signed this Protocol and sixteen have yet to ratify it. However, this final step towards complete abolition of the death penalty – that is to say both in times of peace and in times of war – can be seen as confirmation of the abolitionist trend in the practice of the Contracting States. It does not necessarily run counter to the view that Article 2 has been amended in so far as it permits the death penalty in times of peace.",
                "165. For the time being, the fact that there is still a large number of States who have yet to sign or ratify Protocol No. 13 may prevent the Court from finding that it is the established practice of the Contracting States to regard the implementation of the death penalty as inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, since no derogation may be made from that provision, even in times of war. However, the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber that it is not necessary for the Court to reach any firm conclusion on these points since, for the following reasons, it would be contrary to the Convention, even if Article 2 were to be construed as still permitting the death penalty, to implement a death sentence following an unfair trial. ’",
                "120. It can be seen, therefore, that the Grand Chamber in Öcalan did not exclude that Article 2 had already been amended so as to remove the exception permitting the death penalty. Moreover, as noted above, the position has evolved since then. All but two of the member States have now signed Protocol No. 13 and all but three of the States which have signed it have ratified it. These figures, together with consistent State practice in observing the moratorium on capital punishment, are strongly indicative that Article 2 has been amended so as to prohibit the death penalty in all circumstances. Against this background, the Court does not consider that the wording of the second sentence of Article 2 § 1 continues to act as a bar to its interpreting the words “inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” in Article 3 as including the death penalty (compare Soering, cited above, §§ 102-04) ...",
                "123. The Court further reiterates that expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see Saadi, cited above, § 125). Similarly, Article 2 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 13 prohibit the extradition or deportation of an individual to another State where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk of being subjected to the death penalty there (see Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008; and, mutatis mutandis, Soering, cited above, § 111; S.R. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 62806/00, 23 April 2002; Ismaili v. Germany (dec.), no. 58128/00, 15 March 2001; Bader and Kanbor, cited above, § 42; and Kaboulov v. Ukraine, no. 41015/04, § 99, 19 November 2009). ”",

                "63. The Court notes that, upon becoming a member of the Council of Europe, Russia undertook to abolish the death penalty as a condition of its admission into the organisation. Immediately after that a de facto moratorium on the death penalty was applied in Russia: no one has been given the death penalty or executed since 1996. In 2009 the Russian Constitutional Court confirmed the moratorium and held that a constitutional regime providing for firm guarantees of the right not to be subjected to the death penalty had been formed in Russia. It also found that an irreversible process of abolishing the death penalty was underway in Russia on the basis of its Constitution and its international obligations, including Protocol No. 6, which was signed but not ratified by it (see paragraph 51 above). It is notable that the moratorium in force in Russia, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, does not make an exception allowing imposition of the death penalty in time of war."

In view of Russia ’ s unequivocal undertaking to abolish the death penalty, partly fulfilled through an initially de facto moratorium that was subsequently confirmed de jure by the Constitutional Court, the Court considers that the finding made in the case of Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi ‒ namely that capital punishment has become an unacceptable form of punishment that is no longer permissible under Article 2 as amended by Protocols Nos. 6 and 13 and that it amounts to “inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” under Article 3 (see paragraph 62 above) ‒ applies fully to Russia, even though it has not ratified Protocol No. 6 or signed Protocol No. 13. Russia is therefore bound by an obligation that stems from Articles 2 and 3 not to extradite or deport an individual to another State where there exist substantial grounds for believing that he or she would face a real risk of being subjected to the death penalty there."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not make an assessment of the risks of being subjected to the death penalty and receiving inhuman treatment if the applicant were deported to China. Their reasoning on that issue was limited to stating, without reliance on any domestic provision, that the exclusion order issued against the applicant did not automatically entail his deportation to China and that the applicant could still leave Russia for another country. The Court is not convinced by that argument. The Entry and Exit Procedures Act provides that any foreign national who is the subject of an exclusion order and fails to leave Russia as required is to be deported (see paragraph 49 above). The exclusion order against the applicant mentioned explicitly that if he did not leave Russia before the stated deadline he would be deported (see paragraph 19 above). The Court also notes that the applicant ’ s Russian passport was seized and there is no evidence that he possesses any other valid identity document or the requisite visas allowing him to cross the Russian border and enter a third country. In such circumstances, the Court accepts the applicant ’ s submission that it was impossible for him to leave Russia for another country within the three-day time-limit imposed by the exclusion order and that he is now at imminent risk of deportation to China as a direct and inevitable consequence of that exclusion order."

In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner ’ s welfare and the proportionality of the measure. Firstly, solitary confinement measures should be ordered only in exceptional cases and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules (see paragraph 54 above). Secondly, the decision imposing such solitary confinement must be based on genuine grounds both at the outset and also when its duration is extended. Thirdly, the decisions issued by the authorities should allow it to be established that those authorities have carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the prisoner ’ s circumstances, situation and behaviour, and they must provide substantive reasons in support thereof. The statement of reasons should be increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Finally, a system of regular monitoring of the prisoner ’ s physical and mental condition should also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement measures remain appropriate in the circumstances (see Ramirez Sanchez v.

According to the applicant, he did not have any contact with other inmates. His contact with the warders was limited to the delivery of food through a small window in the door and occasional escorting to the exercise yard, where he was again left alone. The number of family visits was also restricted, meaning that the applicant was allowed only four half-hour visits from his wife during the entire period of his detention. Being locked in his cell, the applicant did not have access to the detention centre ’ s library or to a radio or TV set. He was not given any books or newspapers.

The Court notes that, while the applicant ’ s allegations were supported by a letter from the local Federal Migration Service and affidavits from inmates (see paragraphs 71 and 73 above), the Government have provided no information to counter the applicant ’ s allegations that he was kept in nearly absolute social isolation (see, for similar reasoning, Gorbulya v. Russia, no. 31535/09, § 79, 6 March 2014 ).

It appears that no formal decision to place the applicant in solitary confinement, stating the legal basis and the reasons for that measure or its duration, was ever issued. No such decision was given to the applicant or submitted to the Court by the Government. The applicant was therefore in complete ignorance as to why he had been placed in solitary confinement or for how long a period. Such a state of uncertainty undoubtedly increased his distress. The Court takes note in this connection of the conclusions of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which in its 2011 general report stated that the damaging effects of solitary confinement can be immediate and that they intensify the longer the measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is (see paragraph 55 above). It is deeply concerned by the fact that a person may be placed in solitary confinement without being offered at the very least some explanation for such isolation (see A.B. v.

                "87. The Court reiterates that it has already examined the conditions of detention obtaining in police stations in various Russian regions and found them to be in breach of Article 3 (see Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, § 66 ‑ 70, 25 October 2005; Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, §§ 86-96, 12 June 2008; Kuptsov and Kuptsova v. Russia, no. 6110/03, § § 69 et seq., 3 March 2011; and Ergashev v. Russia, no. 12106/09, §§ 128-34, 20 December 2011 ). It noted that cells in police stations were designed for short-term administrative detention not exceeding three hours. There was no provision for supplying detainees with food or drinking water, and toilet access was problematic. Being dark, poorly ventilated, dirty, and devoid of any of the amenities required for prolonged periods of detention, such as a toilet, a sink, and any furniture other than a bench, administrative-detention cells in police stations were therefore unacceptable for periods of detention longer than just a few hours. The Court, for instance, found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant had been kept in an administrative ‑ detention police cell for twenty ‑ two hours (see Fedotov, cited above, § 68 )."

The applicant was held in an administrative-detention police cell for two days despite the fact that it had been designed for detention not exceeding three hours. By its design, the cell lacked the amenities required for prolonged periods of detention. It did not have a toilet or a sink. It was equipped only with a bench, there being no bed, chair or table or any other furniture. Toilet access was restricted. The window was covered with a metal sheet blocking access to fresh air and daylight."

The Court notes that the Government did not submit copies of the police officers ’ statements on which they relied to support their allegation that the applicant had been given food. Nor did they refer to any domestic provision requiring the police station to make arrangements for providing inmates of administrative ‑ detention cells with food or drinking water. Indeed, the Court has found on several earlier occasions that such inmates were not provided with food or water and that the possibility for their relatives to bring them food could not make up for the lack of the most basic necessities during his detention (see Fedotov, cited above, § § 67 and 68; Shchebet, cited above, § 93; and Ergashev, cited above, § 132)."
