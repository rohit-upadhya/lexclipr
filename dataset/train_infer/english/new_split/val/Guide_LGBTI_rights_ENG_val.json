This is the case especially where the positive obligations implicit in that concept are concerned, as in the instant case (see the Rees v. the United Kingdom judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, p. 14, para. 35, and the Cossey v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 184, p. 15, para. 36), and its requirements will vary considerably from case to case according to the practices followed and the situations obtaining in the Contracting States. In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual (see in particular the above-mentioned Cossey judgment, p. 15, para. 37)."

This number was used as part of the system of dealings between social security institutions, employers and those insured; it therefore appeared on records of contributions paid and on payslips. A transsexual was consequently unable to hide his or her situation from a potential employer and the employer ’ s administrative staff; the same applied to the many occasions in daily life where it was necessary to prove the existence and amount of one ’ s income (taking a lease, opening a bank account, applying for credit, etc). This led to difficulties for the social and professional integration of transsexuals. Miss B. had allegedly been a victim of this herself. The INSEE number was also used by the Banque de France in keeping the register of stolen and worthless cheques.",

While the Court is not formally bound to follow its previous judgments, it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that it should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases (see, for example, Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, ECHR 2001-I, § 70). However, since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond, for example, to any evolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved (see, amongst other authorities, the Cossey judgment, p. 14, § 35, and Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, judgment of 28 May 2002, to be published in ECHR 2002-, §§ 67-68). It is of crucial importance that the Convention is interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. A failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would indeed risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see the above-cited Stafford v. the United Kingdom judgment, § 68). In the present context the Court has, on several occasions since 1986, signalled its consciousness of the serious problems facing transsexuals and stressed the importance of keeping the need for appropriate legal measures in this area under review (see the Rees judgment, § 47; the Cossey judgment, § 42; the Sheffield and Horsham judgment, § 60)."

The Court observes that in the case of Rees in 1986 it had noted that little common ground existed between States, some of which did permit change of gender and some of which did not and that generally speaking the law seemed to be in a state of transition (see § 37). In the later case of Sheffield and Horsham, the Court's judgment laid emphasis on the lack of a common European approach as to how to address the repercussions which the legal recognition of a change of sex may entail for other areas of law such as marriage, filiation, privacy or data protection. While this would appear to remain the case, the lack of such a common approach among forty-three Contracting States with widely diverse legal systems and traditions is hardly surprising. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is indeed primarily for the Contracting States to decide on the measures necessary to secure Convention rights within their jurisdiction and, in resolving within their domestic legal systems the practical problems created by the legal recognition of post-operative gender status, the Contracting States must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation. The Court accordingly attaches less importance to the lack of evidence of a common European approach to the resolution of the legal and practical problems posed, than to the clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend in favour not only of increased social acceptance of transsexuals but of legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals.",

Under Article 8 of the Convention in particular, where the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees, protection is given to the personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of their identity as individual human beings (see, inter alia, Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, judgment of 29 April 2002, § 62, and Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, judgment of 7 February 2002, § 53, both to be published in ECHR 2002-...). In the twenty first century the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security in the full sense enjoyed by others in society cannot be regarded as a matter of controversy requiring the lapse of time to cast clearer light on the issues involved. In short, the unsatisfactory situation in which post-operative transsexuals live in an intermediate zone as not quite one gender or the other is no longer sustainable. Domestic recognition of this evaluation may be found in the report of the Interdepartmental Working Group and the Court of Appeal's judgment of Bellinger v. Bellinger (see paragraphs 50, 52-53)."

The official position is that an amendment may only be made if the error occurred when the birth was registered. The fact that it may become evident later in a person's life that his or her “psychological” sex is in conflict with the biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry at birth was a factual error. Only in cases where the apparent and genital sex of a child was wrongly identified, or where the biological criteria were not congruent, can a change in the initial entry be made. It is necessary for that purpose to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect. No error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex."

A smaller number will undergo surgical procedures to make their bodies resemble, so far as possible, those of their acquired gender. The extent of treatment may be determined by individual choice, or by other factors such as health or financial resources. Many people revert to their biological sex after living for some time in the opposite sex, and some alternate between the two sexes throughout their lives. Consideration of the way forward must therefore take into account the needs of people at these different stages of change.",

The criminal justice system (i.e. the police, prisons, courts, etc.) try to accommodate the needs of transsexual people so far as is possible within operational constraints. A transsexual offender will normally be charged in their acquired gender, and a post-operative prisoner will usually be sent to a prison appropriate to their new status.

The lack of legal recognition of her changed gender had been the cause of numerous discriminatory and humiliating experiences in her everyday life. In the past, in particular from 1990 to 1992, she was abused at work and did not receive proper protection against discrimination. She claimed that all the special procedures through which she had to go in respect of her NI contributions and State retirement pension constituted in themselves an unjustified difference in treatment, as they would have been unnecessary had she been recognised as a woman for legal purposes.

The applicant had been issued with a new NI card with her changed name and style of address. Furthermore, the DSS had a policy of confidentiality of the personal details of a NI number holder and, in particular, a policy and procedure for the special protection of transsexuals. As a result, an employer had no means of lawfully obtaining information from the DSS about the previous sexual identity of an employee. It was also in their view highly unlikely that the applicant's employer would discover her change of gender through her NI number in any other way.

In those cases, it held that the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to alter the register of births or to issue birth certificates whose contents and nature differed from those of the original entries concerning the recorded gender of the individual could not be considered as an interference with the right to respect for private life (the above-mentioned Rees judgment, p. 14, § 35, and Cossey judgment, p. 15, § 36). It also held that there was no positive obligation on the Government to alter their existing system for the registration of births by establishing a new system or type of documentation to provide proof of current civil status. Similarly, there was no duty on the Government to permit annotations to the existing register of births, or to keep any such annotation secret from third parties (the above-mentioned Rees judgment, p. 17, § 42, and Cossey judgment, p. 15, §§ 38-39). It was found in those cases that the authorities had taken steps to minimise intrusive enquiries (for example, by allowing transsexuals to be issued with driving licences, passports and other types of documents in their new name and gender). Nor had it been shown that the failure to accord general legal recognition of the change of gender had given rise in the applicants' own case histories to detriment of sufficient seriousness to override the respondent State's margin of appreciation in this area (the Sheffield and Horsham judgment cited above, p. 2028-29, § 59)."

However, since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond, for example, to any evolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved (see, amongst other authorities, the Cossey judgment, p. 14, § 35, and Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, judgment of 28 May 2002, to be published in ECHR 2002-, §§ 67-68). It is of crucial importance that the Convention is interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. A failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would indeed risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see the above-cited Stafford v. the United Kingdom judgment, § 68). In the present context the Court has, on several occasions since 1986, signalled its consciousness of the serious problems facing transsexuals and stressed the importance of keeping the need for appropriate legal measures in this area under review (see the Rees judgment, § 47; the Cossey judgment, § 42; the Sheffield and Horsham judgment, § 60)."

This has had, and continues to have, effects on the applicant's life where sex is of legal relevance and distinctions are made between men and women, as, inter alia, in the area of pensions and retirement age. For example, the applicant must continue to pay national insurance contributions until the age of 65 due to her legal status as male. However as she is employed in her gender identity as a female, she has had to obtain an exemption certificate which allows the payments from her employer to stop while she continues to make such payments herself. Though the Government submitted that this made due allowance for the difficulties of her position, the Court would note that she nonetheless has to make use of a special procedure that might in itself call attention to her status."

The stress and alienation arising from a discordance between the position in society assumed by a post-operative transsexual and the status imposed by law which refuses to recognise the change of gender cannot, in the Court's view, be regarded as a minor inconvenience arising from a formality.

The Court is struck by the fact that nonetheless the gender re-assignment which is lawfully provided is not met with full recognition in law, which might be regarded as the final and culminating step in the long and difficult process of transformation which the transsexual has undergone. The coherence of the administrative and legal practices within the domestic system must be regarded as an important factor in the assessment carried out under Article 8 of the Convention. Where a State has authorised the treatment and surgery alleviating the condition of a transsexual, financed or assisted in financing the operations and indeed permits the artificial insemination of a woman living with a female-to-male transsexual (as demonstrated in the case of X., Y. and Z. v. the United Kingdom, cited above), it appears illogical to refuse to recognise the legal implications of the result to which the treatment leads."

The expert evidence in the domestic case of Bellinger v. Bellinger was found to indicate a growing acceptance of findings of sexual differences in the brain that are determined pre- natally, though scientific proof for the theory was far from complete. The Court considers it more significant however that transsexualism has wide international recognition as a medical condition for which treatment is provided in order to afford relief (for example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth edition (DSM-IV) replaced the diagnosis of transsexualism with “gender identity disorder”; see also the International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10)). The United Kingdom national health service, in common with the vast majority of Contracting States, acknowledges the existence of the condition and provides or permits treatment, including irreversible surgery. The medical and surgical acts which in this case rendered the gender re-assignment possible were indeed carried out under the supervision of the national health authorities. Nor, given the numerous and painful interventions involved in such surgery and the level of commitment and conviction required to achieve a change in social gender role, can it be suggested that there is anything arbitrary or capricious in the decision taken by a person to undergo gender re-assignment. In those circumstances, the ongoing scientific and medical debate as to the exact causes of the condition is of diminished relevance."

It is known however that chromosomal anomalies may arise naturally (for example, in cases of intersex conditions where the biological criteria at birth are not congruent) and in those cases, some persons have to be assigned to one sex or the other as seems most appropriate in the circumstances of the individual case. It is not apparent to the Court that the chromosomal element, amongst all the others, must inevitably take on decisive significance for the purposes of legal attribution of gender identity for transsexuals (see the dissenting opinion of Thorpe LJ in Bellinger v.

The latest survey submitted by Liberty in the present case shows a continuing international trend towards legal recognition (see paragraphs 55-56 above). In Australia and New Zealand, it appears that the courts are moving away from the biological birth view of sex (as set out in the United Kingdom case of Corbett v.

In the later case of Sheffield and Horsham, the Court's judgment laid emphasis on the lack of a common European approach as to how to address the repercussions which the legal recognition of a change of sex may entail for other areas of law such as marriage, filiation, privacy or data protection. While this would appear to remain the case, the lack of such a common approach among forty-three Contracting States with widely diverse legal systems and traditions is hardly surprising. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is indeed primarily for the Contracting States to decide on the measures necessary to secure Convention rights within their jurisdiction and, in resolving within their domestic legal systems the practical problems created by the legal recognition of post-operative gender status, the Contracting States must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation. The Court accordingly attaches less importance to the lack of evidence of a common European approach to the resolution of the legal and practical problems posed, than to the clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend in favour not only of increased social acceptance of transsexuals but of legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals.",

As Lord Justice Thorpe observed in the Bellinger case, any “spectral difficulties”, particularly in the field of family law, are both manageable and acceptable if confined to the case of fully achieved and post-operative transsexuals. Nor is the Court convinced by arguments that allowing the applicant to fall under the rules applicable to women, which would also change the date of eligibility for her state pension, would cause any injustice to others in the national insurance and state pension systems as alleged by the Government. No concrete or substantial hardship or detriment to the public interest has indeed been demonstrated as likely to flow from any change to the status of transsexuals and, as regards other possible consequences, the Court considers that society may reasonably be expected to tolerate a certain inconvenience to enable individuals to live in dignity and worth in accordance with the sexual identity chosen by them at great personal cost."

                "92. In the previous cases from the United Kingdom, this Court has since 1986 emphasised the importance of keeping the need for appropriate legal measures under review having regard to scientific and societal developments (see references at paragraph 73). Most recently in the Sheffield and Horsham case in 1998, it observed that the respondent State had not yet taken any steps to do so despite an increase in the social acceptance of the phenomenon of transsexualism and a growing recognition of the problems with which transsexuals are confronted (cited above, paragraph 60). Even though it found no violation in that case, the need to keep this area under review was expressly re-iterated. Since then, a report has been issued in April 2000 by the Interdepartmental Working Group which set out a survey of the current position of transsexuals in inter alia criminal law, family and employment matters and identified various options for reform. Nothing has effectively been done to further these proposals and in July 2001 the Court of Appeal noted that there were no plans to do so (see paragraphs 52-53). It may be observed that the only legislative reform of note, applying certain non-discrimination provisions to transsexuals, flowed from a decision of the European Court of Justice of 30 April 1996 which held that discrimination based on a change of gender was equivalent to discrimination on grounds of sex (see paragraphs 43-45 above)."

Having regard to the above considerations, the Court finds that the respondent Government can no longer claim that the matter falls within their margin of appreciation, save as regards the appropriate means of achieving recognition of the right protected under the Convention. Since there are no significant factors of public interest to weigh against the interest of this individual applicant in obtaining legal recognition of her gender re-assignment, it reaches the conclusion that the fair balance that is inherent in the Convention now tilts decisively in favour of the applicant. There has, accordingly, been a failure to respect her right to private life in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.",

They also pointed out that the domestic law approach had been recently reviewed and upheld by the Court of Appeal in Bellinger v. Bellinger, the matter now pending before the House of Lords. In their view, if any change in this important or sensitive area were to be made, it should come from the United Kingdom's own courts acting within the margin of appreciation which this Court has always afforded.

The Court recalls that in the cases of Rees, Cossey and Sheffield and Horsham the inability of the transsexuals in those cases to marry a person of the sex opposite to their re-assigned gender was not found in breach of Article 12 of the Convention. These findings were based variously on the reasoning that the right to marry referred to traditional marriage between persons of opposite biological sex (the Rees judgment, p. 19, § 49), the view that continued adoption of biological criteria in domestic law for determining a person's sex for the purpose of marriage was encompassed within the power of Contracting States to regulate by national law the exercise of the right to marry and the conclusion that national laws in that respect could not be regarded as restricting or reducing the right of a transsexual to marry in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right was impaired (the Cossey judgment, p. 18, §§ 44-46, the Sheffield and Horsham judgment, p. 2030, §§ 66-67).

The Court is not persuaded that at the date of this case it can still be assumed that these terms must refer to a determination of gender by purely biological criteria (as held by Ormrod J. in the case of Corbett v. Corbett, paragraph 21 above). There have been major social changes in the institution of marriage since the adoption of the Convention as well as dramatic changes brought about by developments in medicine and science in the field of transsexuality. The Court has found above, under Article 8 of the Convention, that a test of congruent biological factors can no longer be decisive in denying legal recognition to the change of gender of a post-operative transsexual. There are other important factors – the acceptance of the condition of gender identity disorder by the medical professions and health authorities within Contracting States, the provision of treatment including surgery to assimilate the individual as closely as possible to the gender in which they perceive that they properly belong and the assumption by the transsexual of the social role of the assigned gender. The Court would also note that Article 9 of the recently adopted Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union departs, no doubt deliberately, from the wording of Article 12 of the Convention in removing the reference to men and women (see paragraph 58 above)."

The right under Article 8 to respect for private life does not however subsume all the issues under Article 12, where conditions imposed by national laws are accorded a specific mention. The Court has therefore considered whether the allocation of sex in national law to that registered at birth is a limitation impairing the very essence of the right to marry in this case. In that regard, it finds that it is artificial to assert that post-operative transsexuals have not been deprived of the right to marry as, according to law, they remain able to marry a person of their former opposite sex. The applicant in this case lives as a woman, is in a relationship with a man and would only wish to marry a man. She has no possibility of doing so. In the Court's view, she may therefore claim that the very essence of her right to marry has been infringed."

The Government have argued that in this sensitive area eligibility for marriage under national law should be left to the domestic courts within the State's margin of appreciation, adverting to the potential impact on already existing marriages in which a transsexual is a partner. It appears however from the opinions of the majority of the Court of Appeal judgment in Bellinger v. Bellinger that the domestic courts tend to the view that the matter is best handled by the legislature, while the Government have no present intention to introduce legislation (see paragraphs 52-53)."

It may be noted from the materials submitted by Liberty that though there is widespread acceptance of the marriage of transsexuals, fewer countries permit the marriage of transsexuals in their assigned gender than recognise the change of gender itself. The Court is not persuaded however that this supports an argument for leaving the matter entirely to the Contracting States as being within their margin of appreciation. This would be tantamount to finding that the range of options open to a Contracting State included an effective bar on any exercise of the right to marry. The margin of appreciation cannot extend so far. While it is for the Contracting State to determine inter alia the conditions under which a person claiming legal recognition as a transsexual establishes that gender re-assignment has been properly effected or under which past marriages cease to be valid and the formalities applicable to future marriages (including, for example, the information to be furnished to intended spouses), the Court finds no justification for barring the transsexual from enjoying the right to marry under any circumstances."

                "“ ... Regarding the grounds for refusing Ms B. authorisation:",
                "Firstly, the fact that a request for authorisation to adopt a child is submitted by a single person, as is permitted by Article 343-1 of the Civil Code, does not prevent the administrative authority from ascertaining, in terms of child-rearing and psychological factors that foster the development of the child's personality, whether the prospective adoptive parent can offer – in her circle of family and friends – a paternal “ role model or referent ” where the application is submitted by a woman ...; nor, where a single person seeking to adopt is in a stable relationship with another person, who will inevitably be required to contribute to providing the child with a suitable home for the purposes of the above-mentioned provisions, does this fact prevent the authority from determining – even if the relationship in question is not a legally binding one – whether the conduct or personality of the third person, considered on the basis of objective considerations, is conducive to providing a suitable home. Accordingly, the Administrative Court of Appeal did not err in law in considering that the two grounds on which the application by Ms [B.] for authorisation as a single person was refused – namely, the “ absence of identificational markers due to the lack of a paternal role model or referent ” and “the ambivalence of the commitment of each member of the household to the adoptive child” – were capable of justifying, under the above-mentioned provisions of the decree of 1 September 1998, the refusal to grant authorisation;",
                "Secondly, with regard to Ms [B.]'s assertion that, in referring to her “ lifestyle ” to justify the refusal to grant her authorisation to adopt, the Administrative Court of Appeal had implicitly referred to her sexual orientation, it can be seen from the documents submitted to the tribunals of fact that Ms [B.] was, at the time of the examination of her application, in a stable homosexual relationship. As that relationship had to be taken into consideration in the needs and interests of an adopted child, the court neither based its decision on a position of principle in view of the applicant's sexual orientation nor breached the combined requirements of Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; nor did it breach the provisions of Article L. 225-2 of the Criminal Code prohibiting sexual discrimination;",
                "Thirdly, in considering that Ms [B.], “ having regard to her lifestyle and despite her undoubted personal qualities and aptitude for bringing up children, did not provide the requisite safeguards – from a family, child-rearing and psychological perspective – for adopting a child ”, the Administrative Court of Appeal, which did not disregard the elements favourable to the applicant in the file submitted to it, did not distort the contents of the file;",

France, no. 36515/97, § 32, ECHR 2002-I), the refusal to grant the applicant authorisation had not been based, explicitly or implicitly, on the applicant's sexual orientation and could not therefore amount to direct or indirect discrimination based on her homosexuality."

With regard to the ground relating to the lack of a paternal referent, the Government pointed out that many professionals considered that a model of sexual difference was an important factor in a child's identity and that it was perfectly understandable that the social services of the département should take into consideration the lack of markers enabling a child to construct its identity with reference to a father figure. The Government cited decisions of the domestic courts in support of their submission that any other heterosexual applicant whose immediate circle of family and friends did not include a member of the opposite sex would have had their application refused on the same ground."

They observed that the applicant continued to deny the relevance of that fact, whereas it was legitimate to have regard to the conduct of a prospective adoptive parent's immediate circle of family and friends where there were plans to bring a child into the home. Irrespective of the lack of legal consequences for the partner, the arrival of a child would change the balance of the receiving couple and the family unit, and an adopted child's previous history made it all the more important to assess the solidity of a couple's approach to any plan to adopt. Accordingly, apart from the fact that R. would necessarily be involved in the child's day-to-day life, her lack of involvement could be seen as a source of insecurity for the child with the risk that the child would find him or herself in competition with the applicant's partner for the applicant's time and affection. In the Government's submission, that ground could not be said to be related to the applicant's sexual orientation, as had been borne out by the decisions of the domestic courts."

In the Government's view, the circumstances of the present case were therefore very different from those in Fretté ( cited above) and it should be stressed that the French administrative and judicial authorities had given paramount consideration to what lay in the best interests of the child. Those best interests were central to many international instruments binding on France. There was no right to a child or right to authorisation to adopt one. Adoption was a measure taken for the child's protection and was designed to provide him or her with a family. The sole purpose of the authorisation procedure was to identify from among the many candidates the person who could provide a child with the most suitable home in every respect. Accordingly, the desire for a child must not prevail over the child's interests."

Neither party contests this. The right to respect for “ family life ” does not safeguard the mere desire to found a family; it presupposes the existence of a family ( see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, § 31), or at the very least the potential relationship between, for example, a child born out of wedlock and his or her natural father ( see Nylund v. Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI ), or the relationship that arises from a genuine marriage, even if family life has not yet been fully established ( see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, § 62), or the relationship that arises from a lawful and genuine adoption ( see Pini and Others v.

Accordingly, the Court considers that the facts of this case undoubtedly fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. Consequently, the State, which has gone beyond its obligations under Article 8 in creating such a right – a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention – cannot, in the application of that right, take discriminatory measures within the meaning of Article 14 ( see, mutatis mutandis, Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium ”, cited above )."

Having regard to the competing interests of the applicant and children who were eligible for adoption, and to the paramountcy of the latter's best interests, it noted that the scientific community was divided over the possible consequences of a child being adopted by one or more homosexual parents, that there were wide differences in national and international opinion and that there were not enough children to adopt to satisfy demand (§ 42). Taking account of the broad margin of appreciation to be left to States in this area and to the need to protect children's best interests to achieve the desired balance, the Chamber considered that the refusal to authorise adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and that, accordingly, the justification given by the Government appeared objective and reasonable and the difference in treatment complained of was not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (§§ 42 and 43)."

Accordingly, where a male or female applicant, although unmarried, has already set up home with a partner, that partner's attitude and the role he or she will necessarily play on a daily basis in the life of the child joining the home set-up require a full examination in the child's best interests. It would moreover be surprising, to say the least, if the relevant authorities, having been informed of the existence of a de facto couple, pretended to be unaware of that fact when assessing the conditions in which the child would be given a home and his future life in that new home.

Besides their considerations regarding the applicant's “ lifestyle ”, they above all confirmed the decision of the president of the council for the département. The Court points out that the latter reached his decision in the light of the opinion given by the adoption board whose various members had expressed themselves individually in writing, mainly recommending, with reasons in support of that recommendation, that the application be refused on the basis of the two grounds in question. It observes that the manner in which certain opinions were expressed was indeed revealing in that the applicant's homosexuality was a determining factor. In particular, the Court notes that in his opinion of 12 October 1998 the psychologist from the children's welfare service recommended that authorisation be refused, referring to, among other things, an “ unusual attitude [ on the part of the applicant ] to men in that men are rejected” (see paragraph 13 above)."

The Court observes that at times it was her status as a single person that was relied on as a ground for refusing the applicant authorisation to adopt, whereas the law makes express provision for the right of single persons to apply for authorisation to adopt. This emerges particularly clearly from the conclusions of the psychologist who, in her report on her interviews with the applicant of 28 August 1998, stated, with express reference to the applicant's case and not as a general comment – since she prefaces her remark with the statement that she is not seeking to diminish the applicant's confidence in herself or to insinuate that she would be harmful to a child – that “all the studies on parenthood show that a child needs both its parents ” ( see paragraph 11 above ). On 28 October 1998 the adoption board's representative from the Family Council for the association of children currently or formerly in State care recommended refusing authorisation on the ground that an adoptive family had to be composed “ of a mixed couple ( man and woman ) ” ( see paragraph 14 above )."

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person ( see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 22). It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual ’ s physical and social identity ( see Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 53, ECHR 2002-I ). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, for example, B. v. France, cited above, pp. 53-54, § 63; Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 28, § 24; Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 19 8 1, Series A no. 45, pp. 18-19, § 41; Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 19 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 131, § 36; and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 71, ECHR 1999-VI). Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v. Austria, judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, § 45). Likewise, the Court has held that although no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002-III ). Moreover, the very essence of the Convention being respect for human dignity and human freedom, protection is given to the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security (see I. v. the United Kingdom, § 70, and Christine Goodwin, § 90, both cited above )."

The Court of Appeal had regard to various passages of the expert opinion. Thus, it noted that the expert had considered gender reassignment surgery as one possible medical treatment; however, the question of necessity could not be clearly affirmed given the diverging scientific opinions and results. In his view, consensus existed on the improved psycho-social situation following the change of the sexual role, although the effect of the operation as such was often overrated. In the applicant ’ s case, the advantages of an operation would, in the expert ’ s view, prevail, while psychotherapy could not cure the transsexuality on account of the applicant ’ s chronic narcissistic character structure; even extended psychotherapy was not likely to result in any changes. Turning to the expert ’ s statement that gender reassignment was not the only possible curative treatment, but recommendable from a psychiatric -psychotherapheutic point of view in order to improve the applicant ’ s social situation, the Court of Appeal found that, with this cautious formulation, the expert had not clearly affirmed the necessity of an operation. The applicant had therefore failed to prove that the conditions for reimbursement of medical treatment were met in her case. The Court of Appeal added that, while the expert had mentioned that the gender reassignment operation “ formed part of the curative treatment of a mental disease ”, taking his other statements into account, he had regarded success as rather uncertain. Such a vague hope could not justify the necessity of medical treatment, bearing the aim of health insurance in mind. Thus, the health insurance had to bear only costs of treatment suitable to cure a disease. In the applicant ’ s case, the expert had explained that gender reassignment measures could not be expected to cure the applicant ’ s transsexuality, but at best to improve her psycho-social situation. This result was insufficient, as such an improvement did not affect the applicant ’ s transsexuality as such.

Bellinger was found to indicate a growing acceptance of findings of sexual differences in the brain that are determined pre- natally, although scientific proof for the theory was far from complete. The Court considers it more significant however that transsexualism has wide international recognition as a medical condition for which treatment is provided in order to afford relief (for example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4 th edition (DSM-IV) replaced the diagnosis of transsexualism with ‘ gender identity disorder ’; see also The International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition (ICD-10)). The United Kingdom National Health Service, in common with the vast majority of Contracting States, acknowledges the existence of the condition and provides or permits treatment, including irreversible surgery. The medical and surgical acts which in this case rendered the gender reassignment possible were indeed carried out under the supervision of the national health authorities. Nor, given the numerous and painful interventions involved in such surgery and the level of commitment and conviction required to achieve a change in social gender role, can it be suggested that there is anything arbitrary or capricious in the decision taken by a person to undergo gender reassignment.

It is known however that chromosomal anomalies may arise naturally (for example, in cases of intersex conditions where the biological criteria at birth are not congruent) and in those cases, some persons have to be assigned to one sex or the other as seems most appropriate in the circumstances of the individual case. It is not apparent to the Court that the chromosomal element, amongst all the others, must inevitably take on decisive significance for the purposes of legal attribution of gender identity for transsexuals ... ”",

In 1992 the Regional Court ordered an expert opinion on the questions of the applicant ’ s transsexuality and the necessity of gender reassignment measures. The Regional Court and the Court of Appeal concluded that the expert had not clearly affirmed the medical necessity of gender reassignment surgery.

It had not criticised the applicant ’ s sexual orientation, nor had it regarded this orientation as reprehensible or unacceptable.

                "69. As the Court has had previous occasion to remark, the concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person ( see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 22). It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual ’ s physical and social identity ( see Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 53, ECHR 2002-I ). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, for example, B. v. France, cited above, pp. 53-54, § 63; Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 28, § 24; Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 19 8 1, Series A no. 45, pp. 18-19, § 41; Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 19 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 131, § 36; and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 71, ECHR 1999-VI). Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v. Austria, judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, § 45). Likewise, the Court has held that although no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002-III ). Moreover, the very essence of the Convention being respect for human dignity and human freedom, protection is given to the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security (see I. v. the United Kingdom, § 70, and Christine Goodwin, § 90, both cited above )."
            ],
            [
                "70. The Court further reiterates that, while the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, p. 11, § 23; Botta v. Italy, judgment of 24 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 422, § 33; and Mikulić, cited above, § 57)."

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, for instance, Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, § 49; B. v.

It thereby required the applicant not only to prove that this orientation existed and amounted to a disease necessitating hormone treatment and gender reassignment surgery, but also to show the ‘ genuine nature ’ of her transsexuality although, as stated above (see paragraph 75 above), the essential nature and cause of transsexualism are uncertain."

Their sexual identity was a private matter which could not be a condition for confirmation of gender. Transgenderism was a medical condition falling within the scope of private life. The State was violating her right to privacy every time the male identity number revealed that she was a transsexual.

The European Court of Human Rights had found, under Article 12 of the Convention, that there were no acceptable grounds for denying transsexuals the right to marry but that the margin of appreciation in this respect was wide. It was not possible under Finnish law for persons of the same sex to marry, but in such a case they could enter into a registered partnership. As to its legal and economic consequences, a registered partnership was essentially comparable to marriage. The question of transforming the institution of marriage into a gender-neutral one brought significant ethical and religious values into play and required the enactment of an Act of Parliament.

The absence of legal regulations in these member States leaves a number of questions unanswered, among which is the fate of a marriage concluded before gender reassignment surgery. In six member States ( Italy, Hungary, Ireland, Malta, Turkey and Ukraine) relevant legislation on gender recognition exists. In these States the legislation specifically requires that a person be single or divorced, or there are general provisions in the civil codes or family -law provisions stating that after a change of sex any existing marriage is declared null and void or dissolved.

This interference had a basis in national law, namely, in section 2 (1) of the Transsexuals ( Confirmation of Gender ) Act.

As to whether the impugned measures were necessary in a democratic society, the Chamber noted that the applicant and her spouse were lawfully married under domestic law and that they wished to remain married. In domestic law, marriage was only permitted between persons of opposite sex and same-sex marriages were not permitted. The applicant could obtain a new identity number as a woman only if her spouse consented to their marriage being turned into a registered partnership.

The Chamber considered that there were two competing rights which needed to be balanced against each other, namely, the applicant ’ s right to respect for her private life by obtaining a new female identity number and the State ’ s interest in maintaining the traditional institution of marriage intact. Obtaining the former while remaining married would imply a same-sex marriage between the applicant and her spouse, which was not allowed by the current legislation in force in Finland. The Chamber reiterated that, according to the Court ’ s case-law, Article 12 of the Convention did not impose an obligation on Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to marriage. Nor could Article 8, a provision of more general purpose and scope, be interpreted as imposing such an obligation.

The Chamber noted that consensus on same-sex marriages was evolving in the European context, and that some Council of Europe member States had already included such a possibility in their domestic legislation. In Finland, however, this possibility did not exist, although it was currently being examined by Parliament. On the other hand, the rights of same-sex couples were currently protected by the possibility to register a partnership. While it was true that the applicant faced daily situations in which the incorrect identity number created inconvenience for her, the Chamber considered that the applicant had a genuine possibility to change that state of affairs: her marriage could be turned at any time, ex lege, into a registered partnership with the consent of her spouse. If no such consent was obtained, the applicant had the possibility to divorce."

Nor was it disproportionate that the applicant ’ s marriage be turned into a registered partnership as the latter was a genuine option which provided legal protection for same-sex couples that was almost identical to that of marriage. Moreover, although there was a child from the marriage, there was no suggestion that this child, or any other individual, would be adversely affected if the applicant ’ s marriage were turned into a registered partnership. The applicant ’ s rights and obligations arising either from paternity or parenthood would not be altered if her marriage were turned into a registered partnership. The Chamber therefore considered that the effects of the Finnish system had not been shown to be disproportionate and that a fair balance had been struck between the competing interests. There had accordingly been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

The applicant argued that, under the domestic law, she was forced to choose between two fundamental rights recognised under the Convention, namely, her right to sexual self-determination and her right to remain married, with the result that she was effectively compelled to forego one of them. Such legislation placed her in a quandary. She referred in that respect to a judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany of 27 May 2008. The object of her application was not to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples but only to preserve her pre-existing marriage to her spouse. In her case, same-sex marriage was an unintended and accidental outcome of legal gender recognition. She sought protection of a pre-acquired right and not the presumptive right to marry a woman."

Malta ( no. 38816/07, 20 July 2010 ), the family-life aspect of the case could not be excluded. The margin of appreciation should be narrower where a particularly important facet of an individual ’ s existence or identity was at stake. In her submission, the Court should narrow it down even further and move towards removing the divorce requirement in the legal gender recognition context. The margin of appreciation could not extend so far as to allow States to terminate a marriage at their discretion."

The applicant submitted that the divorce requirement imposed by the Transsexuals (Confirmation of Gender) Act was an unnecessary and disproportionate interference with her Article 8 rights. The balancing act carried out by the Chamber had been fundamentally flawed for several reasons."
            ],
            [
                "44. Firstly, the Chamber had failed to weigh up in the balancing exercise the applicant ’ s and her wife’s acquired right to be married. If the applicant had chosen legal gender recognition, this would have terminated her marriage either through divorce or by conversion into a registered partnership. Both scenarios involved termination of the marriage. Conversion into a registered partnership was akin to divorce as the consequences of the conversion only applied for the future. As the spouse ’ s consent was needed, divorce in these circumstances was “forced” by the State. The compulsory termination of the applicant ’ s marriage would have substantially undermined her rights under the Convention as well as the rights of her spouse and daughter. Such dissolution of a valid marriage would have contradicted the underlying commitment to permanence in marriage, distinguishing it from other relationships. Marriage continued to qualify for the highest degree of protection under Article 8 of the Convention. The applicant and her wife had been married for seventeen years, still lived together and had had a child together. The survival of their relationship, despite the gender reassignment of one spouse, demonstrated a high degree of mutual commitment between the spouses. Important distinctions remained between marriage and a registered partnership: when the female partner in a registered partnership gave birth, both parents did not automatically become parents as in the case of marriage. Nor was adoption possible if neither of the parents was a biological parent of the child to be adopted. The applicant and her family would have lost these rights, which were not insignificant, if they had agreed to enter into a registered partnership. It was also doubtful to what extent the legal parent-child relationship between the applicant and her daughter would have survived as there were no provisions to that effect in the Transsexuals (Confirmation of Gender) Act. The spouses had contracted marriage on the understanding, inspired by their strong religious beliefs, that it would last for life. They were not willing to relinquish their marriage under any circumstances. The applicant ’ s gender reassignment did not necessarily transform the couple into a homosexual couple. The applicant ’ s wife, who had entered into the heterosexual relationship seventeen years ago, continued to be heterosexual. Accordingly, the downgrading of the applicant ’ s relationship to a registered partnership did not reflect the reality of the applicant ’ s wife ’ s position. She was forced to make an impossible choice between supporting the applicant or preserving their marriage. Their child ’ s situation would be similar to that of children born out of wedlock."
            ],
            [
                "45. Secondly, the applicant claimed that the Chamber had not given sufficient weight to her right to sexual self-determination. The lack of legal recognition of the applicant ’ s female gender had had profound implications for her daily life. She had effectively been forced to reveal her transsexual condition to complete strangers in daily situations that most people took for granted. For example, the applicant travelled extensively in connection with her job but her passport still indicated that she was a man. When she travelled on her current passport, she was forced to buy airline tickets with the title “ Mr ”. Her appearance with female characteristics at the airport, carrying a passport which stated her gender as male, had inevitably led to intrusive questioning, delays, embarrassment and distress. As Finland had allowed the applicant to change her first names to correspond to her female identity, it was illogical to deny her legal gender recognition at this juncture, thus leaving her stranded in the territory between two sexes for a potentially indeterminate period. The applicant had not chosen to become transsexual and should therefore not be punished by being deprived of her marriage. The express requirement that legal gender recognition was contingent on the termination of marriage did not allow the Finnish courts to make an individualised assessment taking into account the applicant ’ s circumstances. In Schlumpf v. Switzerland ( no. 29002/06, 8 January 2009 ), the Court had found a violation in similar circumstances. The domestic courts had also failed to consider other alternatives that did not require the termination of marriage."
            ],
            [
                "46. Thirdly, the applicant argued that the Chamber ’ s assumption that the State ’ s interest in protecting marriage would be fatally undermined if transsexuals were allowed to marry was inaccurate. The Chamber had wrongly assumed that the only interest of public value involved in the case was protecting the heterosexual character of marriage. The applicant did not specifically challenge the importance of preserving heterosexual marriage but claimed that forcing her to divorce in order to achieve legal gender recognition was an unnecessary and disproportionate means of achieving the State ’ s objective. Allowing transsexuals to marry would only marginally affect heterosexual marriage as such cases were extremely rare. De facto or de jure same-sex marriages might already exist in Finland as the marriage of persons in the same situation as the applicant created the appearance of same-sex marriage. Moreover, legal gender recognition obtained in a foreign State was also valid in Finland."
            ],
            [
                "47. Moreover, the applicant claimed that the Chamber had failed to take due account of the recent international trends towards abandonment of the compulsory divorce requirement, legalisation of same-sex marriage and divorce by free consent. Abandoning compulsory divorce requirements was achieved by either explicitly allowing transsexuals to marry or by legalising same-sex marriage. The applicant referred to comparative - law studies concerning legal gender recognition and marital - status requirements."
            ],
            [
                "48. In Finland there had also been a trend towards abolishing the compulsory divorce requirement. The Ombudsman for Equality had suggested in 2012 that equal marriage rights for all could be a solution which would allow the continuation of marriage where one spouse was transgender. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe had also called for abolition of the divorce requirement following his visit to Finland in 2012. In that context, the Finnish Government had committed themselves to establishing a working group to examine the possibility of reforming the impugned legislation. There was also a European and international trend towards allowing same-sex marriages. Ten European States currently allowed same-sex marriage. The situation in Finland was also expected to change in the near future. In February 2013 the Parliamentary Law Committee had voted down a draft bill to that effect by a narrow majority of nine votes to eight. Public support for same-sex marriage had also grown from 45 % in 2006 to 58 % in March 2013."

                "49. The Government agreed with the Chamber ’ s reasoning and conclusion to the effect that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention in the present case. They noted that the impugned legislation had been passed in order to prevent inequality caused by varying administrative practices throughout the country and in order to set coherent preconditions for legal gender recognition. The bill had initially required that the person requesting legal gender recognition be unmarried or not in a registered partnership and had not allowed his or her marriage or registered partnership to continue in another legally recognised form. This had been seen as unreasonable during the legislative procedure and therefore the conversion mechanism had been introduced into the provision. Since the entry into force of the Transsexuals (Confirmation of Gender) Act, at least fifteen marriages had been turned into registered partnerships and sixteen registered partnerships into marriages. In nine cases the spouses had had children together and in none of these cases had the legal parent -child relationship changed."

            [
                "50. The Government noted that the applicant had on many occasions in her observations erroneously referred to compulsory divorce legislation. However, if the spouse ’ s consent was received, the marriage turned automatically, ex lege, into a registered partnership. The expression “turns into” in section 2 of the Transsexuals (Confirmation of Gender) Act had been explicitly used to illustrate the fact that the legal relationship continued with only a change of title and minor changes to the content of the relationship. This continuity preserved certain derived rights, such as a widower ’ s pension, and did not create a right or obligation to divide the property between the spouses. The length of the partnership was calculated from the beginning of the relationship, not from the change of title of it. Moreover, the rights and obligations pertaining to parenthood did not depend on the gender of the parent. Consequently, there was no obligatory divorce in Finland but, on the contrary, the possibility of divorcing was at the applicant ’ s own discretion. Finnish legislation offered the chance to reconcile both the right to sexual self-determination and the right to marry, in the form of a registered partnership."

The Government pointed out that the only differences between marriage and registered partnership appeared in two areas : establishment of paternity on the basis of marriage did not apply to registered partnerships, nor did the provisions of the Adoption Act or the Names Act regarding the family name of the spouse. However, a registered partner could adopt the other partner ’ s child. Those exceptions were applicable only to those cases in which parenthood had not been established beforehand. Paternity presumed on the basis of marriage or established paternity could not be annulled on the ground that the man later underwent gender reassignment and became a woman. Nor did the father ’ s gender reassignment have any legal effects on his responsibility for the care, custody or maintenance of a child as such responsibility was based on parenthood, irrespective of sex or form of partnership. The applicant was not even claiming that her legal rights and obligations would be reduced were her marriage turned into a registered partnership, but rather relied on the social and symbolic significance of marriage. The Government stressed that the applicant ’ s legal rights and obligations vis-à-vis her child arising either from paternity or parenthood would not be altered and the applicant had not produced any evidence to the contrary. Finnish law did not impose compulsory divorce on the applicant, nor annulment or dissolution of marriage. Nor was there any evidence of possible implications for the applicant ’ s private or family life as she could continue her family life without any interference."

It was well-established in international human rights law that the general prohibition of discrimination included a prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. Both gender identity and sexual orientation related to highly subjective notions of self. Often, discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity found its expression in relation to family relationships. In the vast majority of those cases, the adjudicating bodies concluded that the States had not put forward reasonable, convincing, objective or weighty arguments to justify discrimination against individuals on the ground of their sexual orientation. Stereotypes constituted a form of discrimination when they resulted in differentiated treatment that nullified or impaired the enjoyment of human rights or fundamental freedoms. Many differences in treatment based on sexual orientation had their roots in stereotypes about gender roles."

This conflation affected a person ’ s dignity and rights by forcing a gender definition that might not align with the individual ’ s sense of self. Such conflation was also unnecessary if the law conferred the same status and rights on all couples. States could not impose one particular vision of rights on those who did not share that vision.

Some of the member States either allowed same-sex couples to marry or offered the option of a registered partnership. Of the States which offered the option of a registered partnership, some States currently required mandatory termination of marriage while some other States did not.

Nonetheless, certain factors have been considered relevant for the assessment of the content of those positive obligations on States. Some of them relate to the applicant. They concern the importance of the interest at stake and whether “fundamental values” or “essential aspects” of private life are in issue (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 27, and Gaskin, cited above, § 49), or the impact on an applicant of a discordance between the social reality and the law, the coherence of the administrative and legal practices within the domestic system being regarded as an important factor in the assessment carried out under Article 8 (see B. v.

Other factors relate to the impact of the alleged positive obligation at stake on the State concerned. The question here is whether the alleged obligation is narrow and precise or broad and indeterminate (see Botta v. Italy, 24 February 1998, § 35, Reports 1998 ‑ I), or about the extent of any burden the obligation would impose on the State (see Rees v. the United Kingdom, 17 October 1986, §§ 43-44, Series A no. 106, and Christine Goodwin, cited above, §§ 86-88)."

Where a particularly important facet of an individual ’ s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be restricted (see, for example, X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, §§ 24 and 27, and Christine Goodwin, cited above, § 90; see also Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 71, ECHR 2002 ‑ III ).

France, no. 36515/97, § 41, ECHR 2002-I; and Christine Goodwin, cited above, § 85).

Furthermore, the Convention does not require that any further special arrangements be put in place for situations such as the present one. The Court found in 2006 in the case in Parry ( cited above ) that, even if same-sex marriage was not allowed at the time in English law, the applicants could continue their relationship in all its essentials and could also give it a legal status akin, if not identical, to marriage, through a civil partnership which carried with it almost all the same legal rights and obligations.

Only in six member States which do not allow same-sex marriage does relevant legislation on gender recognition exist. In those States either the legislation specifically requires that a person be single or divorced or there are general provisions stating that after a change of sex any existing marriage is declared null and void or dissolved.

The Court observes that the aim of the impugned legislation, as explained by the Government, was to unify the varying practices applied in different parts of the country and to establish coherent requirements for legal gender recognition. If the consent of the spouse is received, the system provides both for legal recognition of the new gender and legal protection of the relationship. The system works both ways, thus providing not only for a marriage to be converted into a registered partnership, but also for a registered partnership to be converted into a marriage, depending on whether the gender reassignment surgery has the effect of turning the existing relationship into a same-sex or a heterosexual partnership.

However, the Court considers that as the conversion is automatic under the Finnish system, the spouse ’ s consent to the registration of a change of gender is an elementary requirement designed to protect each spouse from the effects of unilateral decisions taken by the other. The requirement of consent is thus clearly an important safeguard which protects the spouse who is not seeking gender recognition. In this context, it is worth noting that consent is also needed when a registered partnership is to be converted into a marriage. This requirement thus applies also for the benefit of the institution of marriage."

As the Government explained, these differences concern the establishment of paternity, adoption outside of the family and the family name. However, these exceptions are applicable only to the extent that those issues have not been settled beforehand. They are therefore not applicable to the present case. Consequently, the Court considers that the differences between a marriage and a registered partnership are not such as to involve an essential change in the applicant ’ s legal situation. The applicant would thus be able to continue enjoying in essence, and in practice, the same legal protection under a registered partnership as that afforded by marriage (see, mutatis mutandis, Schalk and Kopf, cited above, § 109)."

As convincingly explained by the Government, the expression “turns into” in section 2 of the Transsexuals ( Confirmation of Gender ) Act is explicitly used to illustrate the fact that the original legal relationship continues with only a change of title and minor changes to the content of the relationship. The length of the partnership is thus calculated from the date on which it was contracted and not from the change of its title. This may be important in situations in which the length of the relationship is relevant in the domestic legislation, for example when calculating a widower ’ s pension. The Court cannot therefore uphold the applicant ’ s complaint that the conversion of a marriage into a registered partnership would be akin to a divorce."

Furthermore, the Court considers that the effects of the conversion of the applicant ’ s marriage into a registered partnership would be minimal or non-existent as far as the applicant ’ s family life is concerned. The Court stresses that Article 8 also protects the family life of same-sex partners and their children (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, §§ 91 and 94). It does not therefore matter, from the point of view of the protection afforded to family life, whether the applicant ’ s relationship with her family is based on marriage or a registered partnership."

As the applicant ’ s paternity of her daughter has already been validly established during the marriage, the Court is satisfied that under current Finnish law the subsequent conversion of the marriage into a registered partnership would not have any effect on the paternity of the applicant ’ s child. She would thus continue to be considered to have been born in wedlock. Moreover, as the Government noted, in the Finnish system paternity presumed on the basis of marriage or established paternity cannot be annulled on the ground that the man later undergoes gender reassignment and becomes a woman. This is confirmed by the fact that, as the Government have observed, in none of the cases in which conversion has already taken place in Finland has the legal parent- child relationship changed. Nor does the father ’ s gender reassignment have any legal effects on the responsibility for the care, custody or maintenance of a child as in Finland that responsibility is based on parenthood, irrespective of sex or form of partnership. The Court therefore finds it established that the conversion of the applicant ’ s marriage into a registered partnership would have no implications for her family life, as protected by Article 8 of the Convention."

                "87. While it is regrettable that the applicant faces daily situations in which the incorrect identity number creates inconvenience for her, the Court considers that the applicant has a genuine possibility of changing that state of affairs: her marriage can be converted at any time, ex lege, into a registered partnership with the consent of her spouse. If no such consent is obtained, the possibility of divorce, as in any marriage, is always open to her. In the Court ’ s view, it is not disproportionate to require, as a precondition to legal recognition of an acquired gender, that the applicant ’ s marriage be converted into a registered partnership as that is a genuine option which provides legal protection for same-sex couples that is almost identical to that of marriage (see Parry, cited above). The minor differences between these two legal concepts are not capable of rendering the current Finnish system deficient from the point of view of the State ’ s positive obligation."

The applicant had been legally married since 1996. The issue at stake rather concerned the consequences of the applicant ’ s change of gender for the existing marriage between her and her spouse, which had already been examined under Article 8 of the Convention.

In the former case, Article 12 would not be relevant to the applicant ’ s situation as her marriage to her wife had been contracted when they were a different-sex couple. In the latter case, however, the test whether the “ forced ” divorce injured “the very substance of the right to marry” would have to be satisfied. In the applicant ’ s submission, the latter interpretation applied since the Government ’ s ability to interfere with a marriage in a manner such as in the present case would render the right to marry largely ineffective.

The Court ’ s case-law did not protect the applicant ’ s wish to remain married to her female spouse after the confirmation of her new gender, and the matter of how to regulate the effects of the gender change fell within the margin of appreciation of the Contracting State. The Supreme Administrative Court had found in the present case that the domestic legislation did not aim to change the fact that only a man and a woman could marry but rather allowed the relationship to continue as a registered partnership that was legally protected and comparable to marriage. Transformation of the institution of marriage into a gender-neutral one required the enactment of an Act of Parliament."

It enshrines the traditional concept of marriage as being between a man and a woman (see Rees, cited above, § 49 ).

Nor could Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 be interpreted as imposing an obligation on Contracting States to grant same-sex couples a right to remain married.

Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008 )."

They submitted that the comments were not only degrading, detrimental to their dignity and incited discrimination, but also “incited violence and physically violent treatment”. The comments were therefore frightening both to homosexual people in general and to the applicants in particular. The applicants considered that such actions were criminal and merited pre-trial investigation. They reasoned in their request that their wish for the LGL Association, as a non-governmental organisation that defended the public interest, to act on their behalf was based on the applicants’ view that the Lithuanian legal system did not provide any additional procedural guarantees for alleged victims of homophobic hate crimes. The applicants also wrote that they feared retaliation by the authors of the online comments should they personally lodge such a complaint with the prosecutor.

The complaint was lodged on the basis of Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (“Incitement against any national, racial, ethnic, religious or other group of people” – see paragraph 30 below) and Article 19 § 1 (3) of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, which prohibits publishing in the media information that incites hatred or violence against a group of people because of their sexual orientation (see paragraph 33 below).

                "18. On 30 December 2014 a prosecutor at the Klaipėda district prosecutor’s office took the decision not to initiate a pre-trial investigation regarding the LGL Association’s complaint. Having examined the thirty-one comments referred to by the LGL Association, the prosecutor noted that of those thirty-one comments, twenty-seven people had written one comment each, and two people had written two comments each. For the prosecutor, this was easy to establish, since the commenters had placed those comments under their personal profiles. The prosecutor held that in order to assess whether the comments in question were of a criminal nature, it was necessary to take into account not only the comments as such, but also the context in which those comments had been written. Given that the comments had been written by different people, each comment had to be assessed individually, and not collectively. It was also essential to establish whether those comments constituted an active attempt ( aktyvus siekis ) to incite other people to disseminate degrading comments and to incite them to commit violence. The prosecutor then considered that active attempts required “systematic action”. In the applicants’ case, however, that criterion had not been met because various individuals had written only one or two comments, which was not enough to be considered as constituting a systematic attempt to incite hatred or violence against people distinguishable by their sexual orientation. From this it followed that the objective element of a crime, as established under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, was absent. Furthermore, the fact that the “expression of opinion” in question had been non-systematic and isolated meant that there had been no subjective element – namely, that of direct intent – in the crime in question, because by posting the comments the authors thereof had merely been “expressing their opinion”, instead of seeking to incite hatred or violence against individuals who were distinguishable by their sexual orientation. Even though the authors of the comments had reacted “unethically” in respect of the image portrayed in the photograph of the two applicants, such “immoral behaviour” did not constitute an element of a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor lastly considered that the Supreme Court was of a similar view, in view of the fact that by a ruling of 18 December 2012 in case no. 2K-677/2012 it had acquitted a person who had posted a comment stating that gay people were “perverts” and “belonged in a psychiatric hospital”. In that case the Supreme Court had considered that such a comment, even though unethical, had not actively incited hatred or discrimination against homosexual people (for a more detailed description see paragraphs 39-41 below). The prosecutor thus found that his conclusion was in line with the Supreme Court’s practice in such cases – that is to say, that comments of such a tenor were unethical but not criminal."

                "19. On 9 January 2015 the LGL Association lodged an appeal against the prosecutor’s decision with the Klaipėda City District Court. The LGL Association pointed out that the prosecutor had taken the decision not to prosecute on two grounds: firstly, that the actions of the people who had commented on the above-mentioned Facebook post had not been systematic in nature, and secondly, that in respect of cases concerning similar situations (that is to say, comments of a similar nature) the authorities routinely considered that no crime had been committed. The LGL Association noted that in more than 90% of cases in Lithuania, hatred was promoted through the electronic sphere – for example, by the creation of hatred-promoting groups on the Facebook social network or on Internet forums. The LGL Association also relied on Lithuanian court decisions of 2014 at district court (that is to say, first-instance) level which had found that a single comment had been sufficient to find the author thereof guilty of a crime under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 50-51 below). The LGL Association thus disputed the prosecutor’s conclusion that such actions had to be systematic in nature in order for criminal liability to arise. The LGL Association argued that the question of whether or not comments could be deemed to be systematic in nature could be taken into account when assessing the gravity of a crime and imposing a punishment on the author of such comments, but it did not amount to a constitutive element of that crime. As to the applicants’ case in particular, it also argued, inter alia, that several terms contained in the comments had promoted the infliction of physical harm and even the killing of members of the group in question (for example, advocating burning and extermination), which had indicated their authors’ “particular attitude” ( ypatingą nusiteikimą ) towards people of non-traditional sexual orientation and had clearly intentionally articulated a call for violence. On this point the LGL Association relied on the Court’s judgment in Vejdeland v. Sweden (no. 1813/07, §§ 54-55, 9 February 2012), in which it had held that Sweden had not breached the rights of the applicants in that case by prosecuting them, even if their statements had not called for violence. Lastly, the LGL Association argued that if the comments under the photograph of the applicants on Facebook had been only “expressing [the authors’] opinion”, it was totally unclear what could be considered to constitute “publicly ridiculing, expressing contempt, urging hatred or inciting discrimination” within the meaning of Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code. That norm of criminal law was destined to become a “dead letter”, which the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply “by giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law”."

                "20. By a ruling of 23 January 2015, the Klaipėda City District Court dismissed the LGL Association’s appeal. The court shared the prosecutor’s view that the authors of the impugned comments “had chosen improper words” ( pavartojo netinkamus žodžius ) to express their disapproval of homosexual people. Even so, the “mere use of obscenities” ( tik necenzūrinių žodžių pavartojimas ) was not enough to incur criminal liability under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The court considered that in making such comments their authors had not been inciting others to discriminate against or hate homosexuals."

                "21. The District Court also pointed out that the first applicant’s Facebook page, where the picture of the two men kissing had been posted, had been public, visible and accessible not only to his acquaintances and friends, but also to individuals who were completely unknown to him. Therefore, a person who posted in the public sphere ( viešoje erdvėje ) a picture “of two men kissing” should and must have foreseen that such “eccentric behaviour really did not contribute to the social cohesion of those who had different views or to the promotion of tolerance” ( ekscentriškas elgesys tikrai neprisideda prie visuomenėje kitokias pažiūras turinčių asmenų tarpusavio supratimo bei tolerancijos ugdymo ). The owner of a social network profile on which such an image was posted, by exercising his freedom to express his convictions and freedom to promote tolerance, had to take into account the fact that that freedom was inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions of others. According to the court, “the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciate[d] traditional family values” ( itin vertina tradicinės šeimos vertybes ). Indeed, that view was enshrined in Article 38 of the Constitution, which read that the family should be the basis of society and the State, and that marriage should be undertaken on the basis of the free mutual consent of a man and a woman. The District Court also referred to a passage from the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 28 September 2011 (see paragraph 34 below), and from that ruling inferred that “the family, as a constitutional value, is a union between a man and a woman”. Lastly, the court stated that criminal proceedings were an ultima ratio measure and that they should therefore be initiated only when serious grounds and all the elements of a crime existed. This was not the situation in the case at hand. In its view, the decision not to prosecute the authors of the comments had been reasonable."

                "22. The LGL Association lodged an appeal on 29 January 2015. It pleaded that certain comments had been clearly meant to incite violence, thus directly constituting an objective element of a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The LGL Association noted that even milder public comments, although concerning racial or ethnic discrimination, had been considered by the Lithuanian courts to constitute a crime. The LGL Association also argued that the subjective element of a crime, that is to say direct intent, should be assessed only after the identification of the alleged perpetrators and during subsequent criminal proceedings, not at the time that a procedural decision was taken regarding whether to start a pre-trial investigation or not. Responding to the District Court’s statement that the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciated “traditional family values”, the LGL Association underlined that a criminal offence could not be justified by the views and traditions of either an individual or the majority of society. In that connection the LGL Association also relied on the Court’s case-law, which held that freedom of expression was applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those that offended, shocked or disturbed. The LGL Association lastly referred to the Court’s judgment in Balsytė-Lideikienė v. Lithuania (no. 72596/01, § 82, 4 November 2008) to the effect that one right, such as the freedom of speech of the authors of the comments, could be restricted if such a restriction was necessary because that speech was offensive."

By a final ruling of 18 February 2015 the Klaipėda Regional Court dismissed the LGL Association’s appeal, upholding the prosecutor’s and the District Court’s reasoning, including that court’s arguments regarding the applicants’ “eccentric behaviour”. The Regional Court also underlined the fact that the first applicant had posted the photograph in question publicly and had not restricted it to his friends or “like-minded people” ( bendraminčiams ), even though the Facebook social network allowed such a possibility. Such an action could therefore be interpreted as constituting “an attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments”. The court also considered that, in the absence of objective and subjective elements of a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code, it would constitute a “waste of time and resources”, or even an unlawful restriction of the rights of others [that is to say, Internet commenters’] to open criminal proceedings. Lastly, criminal proceedings constituted an ultima ratio measure, and not all actions merited them.",

On several occasions the applicants had been verbally harassed in public places. They had also received a number of threatening private messages in their social network mailboxes.

That principle was specified in more detail by Article 170 of the Criminal Code, which mainly aimed at protecting the equality of persons but also at protecting their honour and dignity. The Supreme Court also pointed out that for criminal liability under Article 170 § 2 to arise, it was sufficient for the person concerned to publicly make “negative, degrading or demeaning” ( neigiami, niekinantys ar žeminantys ) statements towards one of the groups of persons defined in that provision, or by “inciting and urging” ( skatindamas ir kurstydamas ) negative feelings, hatred or discrimination in others in respect of that group of persons, or a member thereof.

Accordingly, for the Supreme Court, “the convicted person’s negative reaction towards the unlawful event as such had [constituted] her natural civic position ( natūrali pilietiška pozicija )”. In that connection one also had to bear in mind the “provocative aspect” of the event and the unlawful manner, that is to say in the course of an unauthorised public gathering, in which the participants of that event had chosen to express their views ( pažiūros ) and ideas.

The participants in that event, when using their right to freely express their beliefs and promote tolerance, should have had regard to the fact that that freedom is inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions [ pažiūros ir tradicijos ] of others.

The Supreme Court furthermore noted that J.J. had been found guilty under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code of having publicly ridiculed ( viešai niekino ) “persons of homosexual orientation” by using the words “perverts” and “reprobates”. The Supreme Court then pointed out that according to both the Lithuanian Language Dictionary ( Lietuvių kalbos žodynas ) and the Contemporary Lithuanian Language Dictionary ( Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas ), a “pervert” was one who had a perversion, was a “degenerate” ( išsigimėlis ), or “a person who did not have a proper lifestyle” ( netvarkingai gyvenąs žmogus ). A “reprobate” was a person who was “naughty” ( išdykęs ), “fidgety” ( nenuorama ), “debauched” ( palaidūnas ) or “profligate” ( ištvirkėlis ). The Supreme Court thus concluded that even though those words had “negative and demeaning” ( neigiama ir niekinama ) connotations in the Lithuanian language, the mere use of those words in the impugned comment, without any concrete and direct statement inciting hatred or discrimination towards this group of persons, meant that there were no objective elements of a crime, as listed in Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code."

Lastly, the use of only two such unethical terms in the public sphere was not sufficient to establish the subjective element of a crime – namely that of the direct intent to incite hatred or discrimination in Internet users reading J.J.’s comment against homosexual persons."

It admitted that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was just as perilous as discrimination on the basis of race or colour of skin. Moreover, comments on the Internet, in the event that they instigated hatred or violence, were dangerous, given the fact that persons could be inclined to write such comments because of the protection that anonymity afforded them and the fact that, because of the nature of the Internet, such comments could be read by a large number of persons, especially when published on one of the most popular websites, as was the situation in that case. The Supreme Court also pointed out that “the topic of sexual minorities’ rights in Lithuania was pertinent ( tema aktuali ) and was surrounded by a certain social tension that was linked, among other things, to a rather conservative (or negative) attitude on the part of society towards sexual minorities”."

Nevertheless, even if the author of that comment had used his right to freedom of expression inappropriately, such a comment could not have posed a real danger to the values protected by Article 170 of the Criminal Code, that is to say it could not have breached homosexuals’ right of equality, collectively or individually, or their dignity. The comment also could not have genuinely incited readers of the Internet portal in question to commit violence against that group or individuals belonging to that group. For the Supreme Court, that conclusion stemmed from the fact that the comment in question had been “laconic” rather than specific (that is to say, the author had not further elaborated on his views in order to incite others against the group of persons in question); and “violence had been discussed only in an abstract manner and through the means of idiom”.

The court noted that V.I. had used that term on one occasion in a public space – on the street in Vilnius. In an appeal on points of law V.I. had pleaded that she had used the term “negro”. The Supreme Court considered that the latter term, if used in Lithuania – which had no history of slave labour, segregation or social conflict on the basis of certain people belonging to another race and where the word “negro” therefore did not have a demeaning connotation – could not have been considered discriminatory on the basis of race. This also stemmed from the fact that “[historically], there were practically no persons of non-Caucasian race living in Lithuania”. The image of a “negro” in Lithuanian culture was linked to that of a person who had been exploited and was hard-working, and who therefore deserved compassion. However, the word “nigger”, which came from the English language, had a demeaning and vulgar connotation, especially when used together with word “fucking”.

However, on 18 December 2012, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and found that her words had been merely inappropriate, but did not constitute incitement to hatred. The Supreme Court was also of the opinion that the woman’s homophobic comments were provoked by the nature of the pro-LGBT event in front of the Seimas and the “eccentric conduct” of the protesters which violated the constitutionally protected traditional family values. Moreover, the Supreme Court emphasised that, in its view, criminal prosecution of homophobic hate speech should only be a measure of last resort [see paragraphs 39-43 above]. In spite of the Supreme Court judgement mentioned above, a Vilnius district court, in January 2013, found a person guilty of encouraging mockery, defiance, discrimination and physical violence against a group of people because of their sexual orientation and ordered him to pay a fine ... for having posted on Facebook: “What we need is another Hitler to exterminate those fags because there’s just too many of them multiplying.”",

There is, however, no full official data on such acts. According to LGBT representatives, this is mainly due to a fear of revealing one’s LGBT identity and lack of trust in the willingness of the police to investigate such crimes. According to the 2013 EU LGBT Survey, 39% of the 821 respondents in Lithuania said they were physically/sexually attacked or threatened with violence, but only 16% reported incidents of hate-motivated violence to the police. A monitoring report prepared by a local NGO reveals nine instances of violence against LGBT persons that occurred between January and November 2013, including one case of extreme physical violence, four cases of assault, and four cases of damage against property. The authorities, on the other hand, did not record any cases for 2013.",

An example is the case of a young man who was beaten up in a bar in Vilnius, after having been approached by the perpetrator with the words ‘Are you gay?’ When he reported the case, the police were unwilling to record it as a homophobic attack and in the course of collecting testimony from the victim an investigator allegedly implied that he had been attacked because he provoked the perpetrator with unwanted advances of a sexual nature.",

Fear of living openly with one’s LGBT identity increases further as a result of violent attacks against public figures who do so, in particular if the bias-motivation is not formally acknowledged and the perpetrators are not apprehended and convicted. On 24 July 2014, for example, an explosive device was thrown at the openly homosexual singer R.K. during a concert in the village of Linksmakalnis. This was not the first attack against the singer. In February 2013, eggs were thrown at him during a concert, hitting him in the face [see also paragraph 54 in fine above].

The book contains fairy tales featuring members of socially vulnerable groups, such as same-sex couples, Roma, and disabled people, and aims at promoting tolerance and respect for diversity among children. Following the complaints, the LEU explained the withdrawal of the book by suddenly describing it as ‘harmful, primitive and biased homosexual propaganda’. Furthermore, the Office of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics concluded that two fairy tales that promote tolerance for same-sex couples are harmful to minors. The Inspectorate’s experts deemed the stories in violation of the Law on the Protection of Minors because they encourage ‘the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania’. The experts also considered the stories to be ‘harmful, invasive, direct and manipulative’.",

Such training for police officers is implementing measures foreseen in the Action Plan for the Promotion of Non-discrimination (2017-2019). While ECRI recognises the positive intentions contained in the Action Plan, its overall level of coordination does not appear to be well developed, which is also highlighted by the fact that the Action Plan was adopted by only one Ministry, namely the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, and shows no evidence of being based on an integrated interagency strategy.",

According to the Government, the criminal case file did not contain the applicants’ letter of 10 December 2014 to the LGL Association asking the latter to pursue criminal proceedings (see paragraph 16 above). The Government asserted that the applicants had only submitted that letter to the Court; it contained no stamp or any other sign confirming its receipt by the LGL Association. In any case, in that letter the applicants had asked the LGL Association to act in its own name, not on their behalf. The Government thus asserted that the opening of the pre-trial investigation had been the intention, exclusively, of the LGL Association, which saw the proceedings as strategic litigation, since the applicants themselves had never wished to institute such proceedings.

As correctly pointed out by the Government, under domestic law any person could inform the relevant domestic institutions of an alleged criminal act (see paragraph 68 in fine above). Moreover, the Government had failed to explain what difference it would have made if the applicants had initiated the domestic proceedings themselves. It also had to be borne in mind that the LGL Association was the sole civil-society organisation in Lithuania representing the interests of the LGBT community and seeking to improve their situation. In fact, its statutes read that it sought to “promote measures to prevent homophobic ... hate crimes” (see paragraph 55 above). Accordingly, it seemed that the Government were challenging the very fact that a civil-society organisation might also have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the applicants’ case, and thus questioning the fundamental role of non-governmental organisations in performing a “public watchdog” function in a pluralist, democratic society. Lastly, the fact that the LGL Association had acted with the full knowledge and consent of the applicants when initiating the domestic proceedings was further confirmed by the fact that it was the applicants themselves who were complaining before the Court as “victims”, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.

Accordingly, in order to be able to lodge an application in accordance with Article 34, an individual must be able to show that he was “directly affected” by the measure complained of.

Subsequently, the LGL Association consistently appealed against the prosecutor’s and the court’s rulings that those comments had been merely unethical and lacked the constitutive elements of a crime (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). The Court attaches considerable significance to the fact that the LGL Association’s capacity to represent the applicants’ interests before the prosecutors and the courts at two levels of jurisdiction has never been questioned or challenged in any way. As a matter of fact – and irrespective of whether the applicants’ complaint to the LGL Association and their request for criminal proceedings to be initiated in respect of the comments on the first applicant’s Facebook page were submitted to the prosecutor and included in the criminal case file – those authorities dealt with the application and appeals submitted to them without any objections as to standing, regardless of their conclusion as to the merits of the complaint (see paragraphs 18, 20-21 and 23 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v.

Furthermore, the Court cannot but note that under Lithuanian law, any person can notify the law-enforcement authorities that a crime may have been committed, and the authorities are then under an obligation to investigate (see paragraph 32 above; see also Česnulevičius v. Lithuania, no. 13462/06, § 49, 10 January 2012). The Government have not demonstrated that such a complaint could not be lodged by a non-governmental organisation, those entities being created precisely for the purpose of representing and defending their members’ interests (see paragraph 29 above; see also paragraph 140 below). In the present case, where the issue of violence-inciting hate speech against persons belonging to the homosexual minority was brought by the LGL Association to the Lithuanian authorities’ attention, the Court is even more inclined to hold that, once they had been notified of those issues – regardless of by whom – the prosecutors were under an obligation to investigate the comments. Such a conclusion also stems from the Government’s own admission, based on the methodological guidelines issued by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s Office, that in respect of homophobic crimes, the launching of a pre-trial investigation should not be formalistic and that prosecutors should be conscious of the vulnerability of the victims of such crimes. Likewise, prosecutors are under an obligation to act, even if the application received is anonymous (see paragraph 31 above). The fact that persons guilty of homophobic speech can be prosecuted on the basis of applications lodged by non-governmental organisations is also supported by the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 50-51 above)."

Although the Government argued that this case had been taken up by the LGL Association by way of strategic litigation, the Court finds that, even if there might have been an element of strategic litigation in the LGL Association lodging the complaint on the applicants’ behalf, this is irrelevant for the admissibility of the applicants’ complaint. It suffices to note that the legal action brought by the LGL Association was not an actio popularis, since it acted not on the basis of any abstract situation, be it a provision of domestic law or practice, affecting LGBT persons in Lithuania, but in response to specific facts affecting the rights of the two applicants – members of that association – under the Convention; moreover, these facts were supported by the evidence which it furnished to the authorities (see paragraph 17 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, § 110)."

Against the above background, the Court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegations, it should have been open to the LGL Association, of which the applicants were members (see paragraph 7 above) and which is a non-governmental organisation set up for the purpose of assisting people who have suffered discrimination to exercise their right to a defence, including in court, to act as a representative of the applicants’ “interests” in the domestic criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 29 and 55 above). To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at the national level. Indeed, the Court has held that in modern-day societies recourse to collective bodies such as associations is one of the accessible means, sometimes the only means, available to citizens to defend their particular interests effectively. Moreover, the standing of associations to bring legal proceedings in defence of their members’ interests is recognised by the legislation of most European countries (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, §§ 37-39, ECHR 2004 ‑ III; see also, mutatis mutandis, Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, §§ 101, 103 and 112, and the case-law cited therein). Any other, excessively formalistic, conclusion would make protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention ineffectual and illusory. In that context, and also in the light of the findings by ECRI (see paragraphs 33 and 58 of the report cited in, respectively, paragraphs 58 and 59 above), the Court is also not ready to disregard the applicants’ statement that they preferred that the LGL Association initiate the criminal proceedings on their behalf for fear that the Internet commenters would retaliate should the applicants launch such proceedings themselves. Lastly, the Court observes that the present application was lodged by the applicants, acting for themselves, after the domestic courts had adopted decisions in the case that dealt with their particular situation."

The difference in treatment had manifested itself in the prosecutor’s and the courts’ refusal to enforce the Lithuanian criminal legislation, notwithstanding the fact that the applicants had been subjected to extreme homophobic online hate speech. The content of the domestic authorities’ decisions had also made it clear that it had been the applicants’ sexual orientation, as demonstrated in the photograph posted on the first applicant’s social network page, that had justified the decision not to start a pre-trial investigation. Accordingly, one could not follow the Government’s argument that in the present case the applicants’ homosexuality itself had never been a ground for refusing to start a pre-trial investigation (see paragraph 93 below). In fact, as pointed out by the Regional Court, it was precisely the public display of their sexual orientation that had been identified by that court as “an attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments” (see paragraph 23 above)."

The fact that they had been treated differently by the public authorities exclusively owing to their sexual orientation could be illustrated by a hypothetical comparison with other individuals in a similar situation, such as a comparison between the applicants and a hypothetical unmarried opposite-sex couple who had posted a picture of themselves kissing on their public social-media profile. Applying the reasoning of the domestic courts, an opposite-sex kiss would have been in line with “traditional family values”. Moreover, since such an opposite-sex kiss (that is to say, “non-eccentric behaviour”) would not have been aimed at provoking people into posting negative comments, the prosecutors would certainly have launched a pre-trial investigation if comments had been posted encouraging Facebook users to “kill” or “burn” an opposite-sex couple. The applicants were likewise convinced that the outcome of the domestic proceedings, that is to say, the decision not to prosecute, would not have occurred if the picture had depicted any other social or ethnic group within Lithuanian society, such as the Lithuanian Jewish community, and analogous comments, such as “throw [them] into the gas chambers” and “exterminate them”, had been posted. The applicants thus asserted that in their own particular case, the refusal by the public authorities to open a pre-trial investigation had been partially or entirely motivated by an unmerited distinction on the grounds of their sexual orientation."

The applicants also disagreed that the expression of their affection (that is to say, their same-sex kiss) should have been considered as constituting “eccentric” or “provocative” conduct, since they had not violated any of the rights of others by posting that particular picture on the first applicant’s Facebook page. They therefore maintained that their different treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation had lacked any objective and reasonable justification. The position of the domestic courts and the Government (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above, and paragraph 94 below) seemed to suggest that the applicants had no right to kiss in public, be that on the first applicant’s Facebook page or on the street, since this amounted to “eccentric behaviour” owing to the applicants’ sexual orientation. The Government’s position also seemed to suggest that if the sight of two men kissing had triggered threats of violence, in strict contravention of Article 170 of the Criminal Code, then that had been the fault of the applicants, and the courts had thus been correct in refusing to enforce the relevant Lithuanian legislation aimed at protecting same-sex couples such as the applicants. Such a position of the Government amounted to accepting as justified the private prejudices of the members of public who had written those threatening comments, rather than using Lithuanian legislation to challenge those prejudices. This was clearly incompatible with Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention and the Court’s case-law on the subject (the applicants relied on Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 97, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI, and Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, § 81, 21 October 2010)."

The applicants further submitted that the domestic authorities had failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests – the right to freedom of expression on the part of the Internet commenters and the applicants’ right to respect for their private life. They also relied on the Court’s judgment in Delfi AS v. Estonia ([GC], no. 64569/09, §§ 110 and 117, ECHR 2015) to the effect that while important benefits could be derived from the Internet in respect of the exercise of freedom of expression, liability for defamatory or other types of unlawful speech had, in principle, to be retained and constituted an effective remedy in respect of violations of personality rights. The Court had also held that the unlawful nature of online comments in certain instances did not require any further linguistic or legal analysis if those remarks were on the face of it unlawful. For the applicants, it was difficult to understand how comments such as “Burn the faggots”, “Into the gas chamber with the pair of them”, “You are fucking gays – you should be exterminated” and “Kill” in their case did not amount to punishable criminal hate speech in respect of sexual orientation under Article 170 of the Criminal Code. If those comments had merely constituted “unethical” expressions of opinion then it was unclear what statements would be “sufficient” to qualify as “publicly ridiculing, expressing contempt, urging hatred or inciting discrimination”."

The applicants also criticised the fact that the domestic authorities had considered that a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 had to have been committed by means of systematic actions, even though neither the wording of that provision nor its interpretation by the domestic courts in other hate-speech cases mandated this criterion. In fact, according to the domestic courts’ case-law, one single expression of public ridicule or contempt – or one single instance of hatred or discrimination against a certain group of people – amounted to the criminal offence of incitement of hatred. It followed that by introducing the additional element of actus reus, the prosecutor and the domestic courts had relied on a flawed interpretation of the law and had violated the fundamental principle of legal certainty."

Although the Government had placed great emphasis on what to them appeared to be a cross woven into the second applicant’s jumper (see paragraph 94 below; see also paragraphs 99 and 118 below), none of the thirty-one online comments brought to the prosecutors’ attention had made reference to any offended religious feelings on the part of the authors of the comments. Furthermore, out of more than 800 comments posted under the photograph in question, the Government had been able to identify only one that referred to the presence of the image of a cross in the picture. This was not surprising, because the position of the second applicant’s left arm had made it impossible to determine whether there was indeed a cross on his jumper, or some other shape. Additionally, the presence of a cross shape had never been addressed as part of any factual and/or legal assessment undertaken by the prosecutor’s office or the domestic courts when deciding on the applicants’ case. The Government’s attempt to introduce an “additional” – and “distracting” – reason for the hostile comments thus had no basis in facts."

Lastly, the applicants acknowledged that one of their aims in posting the photograph in question had been to test the level of tolerance among the Lithuanian population, and it had been their fundamental right to do so under Article 10 of the Convention. In fact, on multiple occasions the Court had reiterated that freedom of expression was applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offended, shocked or disturbed the State or any sector of the population. Accordingly, the Government’s suggestion that the applicants could have concealed their sexual orientation, or exercised reserve in expressing their sexual orientation by not kissing in the photograph, or deleted the negative comments once they had been posted (see paragraph 101 below) was irrelevant, because it once again sought to shift the responsibility for hateful comments being written by perpetrators onto the applicants. The Government had thus seemed to engage in “victim shaming” and “victim blaming”. In a case of gender-based violence, the equivalent statement would be that a woman had been raped because she had been wearing “provocative” or “eccentric” clothing. In that context the applicants also referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union’s findings (see paragraph 65 above), which they saw as a fortiori applying to the expression of sexual orientation in the European Union and the Council of Europe member States."

The applicants’ homosexuality had never been a ground in itself for the refusal to start a pre-trial investigation (the Government contrasted the applicants’ situation to that of the applicants in Smith and Grady, cited above, § 121). The applicants’ conduct had been assessed by the domestic authorities in order to establish the context in which the comments had been made and to establish the intent of the commenters. In that respect the Government also wished to emphasise certain aspects of the domestic courts’ conclusion that the applicants had attempted to deliberately tease or shock individuals holding different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments."

The Government accordingly submitted that, firstly, “the photograph itself was already rather provocative on account of the kiss between two gays”, taken together with the image of a big cross across the second applicant’s jumper. The applicants’ conduct, that is to say their non-verbal means of expression – wearing a jumper with a cross, which was the principal symbol of the Christian religion – could be regarded as a way of expressing the applicants’ views as regards the compatibility of homosexuality with the Christian religion (the Government referred to Donaldson v the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56975/09, § 29, 25 January 2011). In the Government’s view, the public display of such a photograph together with the image of a cross “could have sparked conflict with people of a different cultural and religious background”. This was illustrated by one comment under the photograph, which read as follows: “Very beautiful composition. In particular, the cross on the jumper. In place.” The Government thus considered that in such cases “the Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation in assessing which emblems could potentially inflame existing tensions if displayed publicly” (ibid., § 28)."

Some persons had strongly supported the act of posting the photograph, some had been strongly opposed to homosexuality as such, and others had not been against homosexuality but had nevertheless not approved of the posting of the photograph in question. Thirdly, the provocative nature of the applicants’ behaviour had been recognised by their supporters themselves. Indeed, in a public post of 9 December 2014 – that is to say, only one day after the posting of the photograph of the applicants – LGBT-friendly Vilnius had specifically used the verb “provoked” (see paragraph 11 above); subsequently the first applicant had implied much the same thing (see paragraph 14 above)."

The Government considered that the domestic authorities’ reference to “traditional values” (see paragraph 21 above) did not mean that homosexuals were not tolerated in Lithuanian society. Rather, the domestic courts had been referring to the applicants themselves, who had deliberately demonstrated their opposition to such values. In other words, the domestic authorities’ decision not to start a pre-trial investigation had had nothing to do with so-called “traditional” and “non-traditional” values as such."

Furthermore, the so-called “eccentric behaviour” of the applicants had not been the sole factor prompting the domestic institutions to decide not to start a pre-trial investigation, given that the constitutive elements of a crime had not been established by the domestic authorities in the present case. The Government considered that the situation in the present case differed from a situation involving intense fear and anxiety, such as that described in the judgment of Identoba and Others (cited above, §§ 70-71). Contrary to the facts in that case, the people who had commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters, and no physical assaults had ever taken place against them. In that context it was noteworthy that almost since the re-establishment of Lithuania’s independence in 1990 numerous actions had been taken to protect LGBT rights in the country. Baltic Pride, an annual LGBT pride parade, had taken place in Lithuania in 2010, 2013 and 2016. The applicants had taken part in that parade in 2016, and the first applicant had been happy when there had been no protests against the event (see paragraph 15 above)."

Under Article 170 of the Criminal Code it was a criminal offence to make public statements directed at a wide and unlimited group of people seeking to incite them to violence against a group of other persons belonging to a distinct group owing to their sexual orientation (see paragraphs 44-45 above). The Court had likewise recognised that the “potential impact of the medium concerned was an important factor” (the Government referred to Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary, no. 22947/13, § 56, 2 February 2016). In the present case, however, the comments had been made on a social network page and not, for example, on an Internet news portal, which could have attracted a large number of comments. Moreover, the comments had been made within the context of a discussion started intentionally by the first applicant and had been made on a social network, an action that had been unlikely to attract much attention."

In their view, the Facebook users had posted their comments “on the spot”, not in a premeditated fashion, after they had come across the photograph together with the comments posted by other Facebook users, including by the applicants themselves and their supporters. In the same vein, those commenters, although they had used improper words, had been trying to show that, contrary to what had been suggested by the applicants and their supporters, homosexuality was negative in itself and had a negative impact on children, and that the applicants’ conduct by depicting a cross in their photograph had been incompatible with the Catholic religion. It had to be borne in mind that the domestic authorities had considered that the comments had not been systematic, and that was one of the factors that could also indicate that there had no been direct intent on the part of the perpetrators, and that posting such comments had therefore not reached the threshold required by Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52-53 above). The fact that most of the comments had been one-off ( pavieniai ), and that some had consisted of only a couple of words was a further indication of a lack of intent. That also followed from the Supreme Court’s case-law (see paragraph 45 above). Such a lack of direct intent to incite Internet users against homosexuals had also constituted a ground for the domestic institutions to refuse to initiate a pre-trial investigation."

Belgium (dec.), no. 34367/14, 27 June 2017). The third-party interveners also considered that the elements of likelihood, foreseeability and imminence of hostility or violence had to be considered before determining whether and when instances of hate speech constituted incitement to commit violent acts and should therefore be criminalised.

Furthermore, where hate speech constituting incitement to commit violent acts against individuals had occurred, then the Court’s position was clear: failure to investigate, prosecute and punish such hate speech amounted to a breach of the State’s positive obligations under the Convention (in that context, they cited Faruk Temel v.

Where a difference in treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation, the State’s margin of appreciation is narrow. The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background; in this respect, one of the relevant factors may be the existence or non-existence of common ground between the laws of the Contracting States. Differences based solely on considerations of sexual orientation are unacceptable under the Convention (see, more recently, Ratzenböck and Seydl v.

The Court’s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention.

The fact that human dignity as a constitutional value must be protected by the State has also recently been emphasised by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 35 above).

The Court observes that although in their application to the Court the applicants stated that the idea behind their posting of the photograph in question had been to announce the beginning of their relationship, in their subsequent observations they admitted that the photograph had been meant to incite discussion about gay people’s rights in Lithuania (see paragraph 91 above). That being so, and although the Government saw the latter fact as provocative, the Court does not view either of those reasons as illegitimate or meriting the suppression of the applicants’ rights. On the contrary, it has already held that there is no ambiguity about the member States’ recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms (see Alekseyev, cited above, § 84). The Court also points to LGBT-friendly Vilnius’s follow-up posts on its own Facebook page in which it was stated that the applicants’ photograph had been posted to serve the aim of helping other LGBT people in Lithuania, and potentially those who were “condemned by others” and perhaps “[standing] on the roof of some house, or on the edge of a window sill or balcony”, to move “to a safer spot”. The applicants also confirmed this intention when interviewed by the LGL Association (see paragraphs 11 ‑ 12 above). While accepting the Supreme Court’s finding that the atmosphere in respect of issues concerning homosexuality is tense in Lithuania (see paragraph 22 of the ECRI report cited in paragraph 57 above; as confirmed by other international bodies, see paragraphs 63-64 above), the Court cannot view the above-mentioned intentions, as indicated by the applicants, as having threatened to cause public unrest (see paragraph 44 above; compare and contrast Donaldson, cited above, § 29). In fact, it is a fair and public debate about sexual minorities’ social status that benefits social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views are heard, including the individuals concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 86)."

Furthermore, and even though the Government placed much emphasis on what they saw as the shape of a cross on the first applicant’s sweater in the photograph in question (see paragraph 94 above), the Court must note that this argument was not the subject of any analysis whatsoever, either by the prosecutor or by the courts at two levels of jurisdiction which ruled that the thirty-one comments referred to them by the LGL Association did not constitute a crime. In this context the Court notes the applicants’ view that that argument by the Government was “additional” and “distracting”, also given that the Government could only point to a single religion-related comment (see paragraph 90 above). As the Court does not consider it necessary to take a position on this view of the applicants, it suffices to note the Constitutional Court’s case-law to the effect that Lithuania is a secular State where there is no State religion (see paragraph 38 above). That being so, it appears that the criminal courts which examined the applicants’ case focused on what they saw as the applicants’ “eccentric behaviour”, the argument which the Court will address next."

That view was fully endorsed by the Klaipėda Regional Court, which also found that it would have been preferable if the applicants had only shared such pictures among “like-minded people”, since the Facebook social network allowed such a possibility (see paragraph 23 above). Given those express references to the applicants’ sexual orientation, it is clear that one of the grounds for refusing to open a pre-trial investigation was the courts’ disapproval of the applicants’ demonstrating their sexual orientation (compare and contrast Bączkowski and Others, cited above, §§ 95 and 97)."

The Court furthermore refers to the Klaipėda District Court’s statements that “the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciate[d] traditional family values”, according to which “family, as a constitutional value, [was] the union of a man and a woman”, which that court found to be supported by the Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law (see paragraph 21 above). The Court has already considered a similar argument in Kozak v. Poland (no. 13102/02, § 98, 2 March 2010). In that case it accepted that the protection of the family in the traditional sense was, in principle, a weighty and legitimate reason that might justify a difference in treatment. However, in pursuance of that aim a broad variety of measures might be implemented by the State. Moreover, given that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions, the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family and to secure, as required by Article 8, respect for family life, must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one’s family or private life. In the present case, although the Klaipėda District Court cited the alleged incompatibility between maintaining family values as the foundation of society and acknowledging the social acceptance of homosexuality, the Court sees no reason to consider those elements to be incompatible, especially in view of the growing general tendency to view relationships between same-sex couples as falling within the concept of “family life” (see Bayev and Others v. Russia, nos. 67667/09 and 2 others, § 67, 20 June 2017)."

                "123. The Court also has particularly strong reservations as to the validity of the latter element (that is to say, what constitutes a family), since as far back as 2011 the Constitutional Court underlined that while marriage was a union between a man and a woman, the concept of family was not limited to the union of two such persons (see paragraph 34 above). This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court in 2019 when examining questions related to two persons of the same sex living in two different countries who wished to be reunited in Lithuania (see point 32.5 in paragraph 36 above). In the latter ruling the Constitutional Court also underlined not only the fact that under the Lithuanian Constitution “the concept of family [was] neutral in terms of gender” but also that “the Constitution [was] an anti-majoritarian act” and that the views of the majority could not override those of the minority (see points 31.3 and 32.5 in paragraph 36 above). The Court, for its part, has also held that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group’s rights would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 81, and the case-law cited therein)."

It therefore remains for the Court to determine whether the Government have sufficiently demonstrated that the way the national authorities assessed the relevant facts, as presented in the criminal complaint lodged by the LGL Association, was acceptable (see paragraph 116 above). In particular, the Court is called upon to determine whether the decision by the prosecutor to discontinue the criminal investigation, subsequently confirmed by the national courts, was motivated by a discriminatory attitude and stereotypes related to sexual orientation (see, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v. Portugal, no. 17484/15, § 46, 25 July 2017).",

            [
                "125. On the facts of this case, the Court notes, firstly, the prosecutor’s view that the authors of the comments, including those stating that “it’s not only the Jews that Hitler should have burned” and that “faggots ... [should be thrown] into the gas chamber” or “into the bonfire” or have “a free honeymoon trip to the crematorium”, or have “their heads smash[ed]” or be “castrated” or be “[shot]”(see paragraph 10 above), had acted “unethically” but that such “amoral behaviour” had not reached the threshold required by Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 above). The Klaipėda District Court came to the same conclusion, finding that those comments were mere “obscenities” and the commenters had simply “chosen improper words” (see paragraph 20 above). However, while being careful not to hold that each and every utterance of hate speech must, as such, attract criminal prosecution and criminal sanctions (see paragraph 116 above), the Court is unable to subscribe to the conclusions of the Lithuanian authorities. The Court reiterates its finding that comments that amount to hate speech and incitement to violence, and are thus clearly unlawful on their face, may in principle require the States to take certain positive measures (see, mutatis mutandis, Delfi AS, cited above, §§ 153 and 159). It has likewise held that inciting hatred does not necessarily entail a call for an act of violence or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating racist speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, no. 1813/07, § 55, 9 February 2012). Moreover, the Court cannot but observe that other comments, even without calling for violence, regarding the Jews (see paragraph 52 above) have been treated by the Lithuanian authorities as falling under Article 170 of the Criminal Code. It also considers that the Government have not provided weighty arguments to refute the applicants’ view that if comments such as those uttered in their case did not amount to inciting not only hatred but even violence on the basis of the applicants’ sexual orientation, then it is hard to conceive what statements would (see paragraphs 19 and 87 above). Therefore, the Court, sharing the view of the Constitutional Court that the attitudes or stereotypes prevailing over a certain period of time among the majority of members of society may not serve as justifiable grounds for discriminating against persons solely on the basis of their sexual orientation, or for limiting the right to the protection of private life (see point 31.3 in paragraph 35 above), considers that the assessment made in this case by the national authorities was not in conformity with the fundamental principles of a democratic State governed by the rule of law (see also, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, cited above, § 46, and Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, § 126, 24 May 2016)."

Secondly, the Government also relied on the prosecutor’s finding that the comments lacked a “systematic character”, since most of the comments referred by the LGL Association to the prosecutor had been written by different people (see paragraph 18 above). The Court again cannot subscribe to this argument. It notes that the Lithuanian courts’ practice on this issue is not uniform, in that while the courts sometimes ascribe importance to an accused posting numerous discriminatory comments and find him or her guilty under Article 170 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52-53 above), in other cases the making of a single discriminatory comment is sufficient to attract criminal liability (see paragraphs 46-49 and 54 above). In this context the Court, while acknowledging that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, among many authorities, Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, § 49, 20 October 2011), does not disregard the argument that the LGL Association put forward in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 19 above), namely that the number of comments could constitute a circumstance determining the gravity of the crime or the extent of the culprit’s criminal liability, but that it did not constitute an indispensable element of the crime under the above-mentioned provision of the Criminal Code."

The Court also notes the Klaipėda District Court’s finding that the post on the first applicant’s Facebook page and the comments under it were in the “public sphere” (see paragraph 21 above), which was one of the necessary constitutive elements of a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code. The potential reach of comments on the Internet, as well as the danger they may cause, especially when published on popular Internet websites, has also been underlined by the Lithuanian Supreme Court (see paragraph 44 above). For its part, the Court has also held that in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public’s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. At the same time, in considering the “duties and responsibilities” of those posting such information, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, § 56, with further references). Accordingly, the Court does not find it unreasonable to hold that the posting of even a single hateful comment, let alone a comment that such persons should be “killed”, on the first applicant’s Facebook page was sufficient to be taken seriously. This is further supported by the fact that the photograph had “gone viral” online and received more than 800 comments (see paragraph 10 above). The ECRI report on Lithuania also indicates that the country “has a problem” and that most hate speech takes place on the Internet, and also on social networks (see paragraph 56 above; see also paragraphs 26-27 of the report, cited in paragraph 57 above). The Court therefore also rejects the Government’s argument that comments on Facebook are less dangerous than those on Internet news portals (see paragraph 98 above). Neither can it see as pertinent the Government’s argument that the people who commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters (see paragraph 97 above)."

It considers that this applies equally to hate speech against a person’s sexual orientation and sexual life. The Court observes that the instant case concerns undisguised calls for attacks on the applicants’ physical and mental integrity (see, in this context, Panayotova and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12509/13, §§ 58-59, 7 May 2019, with further references), which require protection by the criminal law (see paragraph 111 above). Article 170 of the Criminal Code does indeed provide for such a protection (see paragraph 30 above). However, owing to the Lithuanian authorities’ discriminatory attitude, the provisions of this Article were not applied in the applicants’ case, and the requisite protection was not granted to them. The Court considers that in the circumstances of this case, it would have been manifestly unreasonable for the victims, and would also have downplayed the seriousness of the impugned comments, to require the applicants to exhaust any other remedies.

Interestingly enough, all of those pre-trial investigations had been either suspended or terminated, and thus had not led to the actual identification or punishment of the alleged perpetrators. The three main reasons for that had been: (a) the failure to identify the individual who had committed the criminal offence in question; (b) the failure to establish the constitutive elements of a criminal offence; and (c) the fact that the IP address in question had belonged to a foreign jurisdiction.

This was clear from the results of a survey conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2013, according to which Lithuania was the most homophobic and transphobic society in the European Union, with the highest average number of violent incidents against LGBT people (see paragraph 63 above). For the applicants, the latter indicator was especially worrisome since it had been established that the prevalence of unpunished hate speech eventually led to actual acts of violence against individuals belonging to certain socially vulnerable groups (see paragraph 28 of the ECRI report cited in paragraph 58 above)."

As regards the remaining twenty-seven cases in which a pre-trial investigation had been opened, one of them was still being pursued, one had been discontinued for failure to establish the constitutive elements of a crime, and twenty-five investigations had been suspended because all possible measures to establish the identity of the people who had committed the crimes in question had been exhausted and unsuccessful, since, as a rule, the IP addresses in question had been in another State.

In fact, the Lithuanian courts, when considering cases related to alleged discrimination and hate speech, based their decisions on international standards in this field, including the Court’s case-law (the Government specifically referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling of 3 October 2017 in case no. 2K-86-648/20016, see paragraph 47 above). Moreover, so-called “traditional values” – referred to by the third-party interveners in their observations – had never resulted in the acquittal of a person in a hate-speech case, since acquittals, including in the applicants’ case, had instead been based on the lack of any of the constitutive elements of a crime. In that context, the Government also disagreed with the third-party interveners’ assessment of the Supreme Court’s ruling of 18 December 2012 (see paragraphs 39-43 above, and paragraph 148 below), and claimed that the term “eccentric behaviour” therein referred not to the participants’ sexual orientation, but to the unauthorised form in which they had expressed those ideas – namely, their unauthorised demonstration next to the Seimas. Similarly, the Supreme Court’s ruling of 1 March 2016 also could not be seen as hostile to homosexual people, since in that case the Supreme Court had had regard not only to the general social context, but also to the particular context in which the comment had been made, and the person had thus been acquitted for lack of any of the constitutive elements of a crime (see paragraphs 44-45 above)."

This practice of the Supreme Court had been condemned by ECRI in its 2016 report, in which Lithuania had been urged to take steps towards preventing the notion of “protecting public morals” from being used to justify or condone incitement of hatred against LGBT people (see paragraph 31 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph 58 above).

At the outset, the Court notes that it does not call into question that the Lithuanian criminal law, in particular Article 170 of the Criminal Code, and criminal justice system, including the courts, provide for a remedy which is generally effective for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention. However, in the present case, the applicants alleged that the authorities had not responded effectively to their complaints of discrimination on account of their sexual orientation (see paragraph 131 above). The Court is therefore called upon to determine whether Article 13 of the Convention can be infringed in situations where generally effective remedies are considered not to have operated effectively in a particular case due to discriminatory attitudes negatively affecting the application of national law. In this regard, the Court notes that in cases involving complaints under Article 13 based on allegations of discriminatory attitudes affecting the effectiveness of remedies in the application of generally applicable national laws, it has usually not considered it necessary to examine the complaints separately under that provision if a violation of Article 14, taken together with other Convention provisions, has already been found (see, in particular, Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 205, ECHR 2009).",

In its assessment, the Court will have regard to general developments in the case-law of the national courts, to conclusions by international monitoring bodies reviewing the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Lithuania and to statistical information provided by the Government, the applicants, the third-party interveners and international bodies."

With regard to the material provided by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), the Court acknowledges that in the cases cited the district courts, that is, the courts of first instance, reached guilty verdicts regarding discriminatory and homophobic comments on the Internet, as well as other types of homophobic behaviour. That being so, and in so far as the applicants’ case is concerned, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that in reaching the conclusion that the comments at issue had been merely “unethical” and “immoral”, the prosecutor relied on the practice of the Supreme Court to the same effect (see paragraphs 18 and 39-41 above). Indeed, in two cases concerning homophobic hate speech, the Supreme Court reached verdicts exculpating those on trial (see paragraphs 39-45 above; compare and contrast the position of the lower courts, indicated in paragraphs 49-51 and 54 above). The Court notes that in its ruling of 18 December 2016, the Supreme Court had recourse to two dictionaries to reach the conclusion that calling people of homosexual orientation names such as “perverts” and “reprobates” who should “be urgently sent to a psychiatric hospital” was negative and demeaning, but that the use of those names did not call for the application of Article 170 of the Criminal Code, which establishes criminal liability for discrimination, inter alia, on the basis of sexual orientation (see paragraphs 39 and 42 above). The Court notes with concern the emphasis in the Supreme Court’s ruling on the “eccentric behaviour” or the supposed duty of persons belonging to sexual minorities “to respect the views and traditions of others” in exercising their own personality rights (see paragraph 41 above).",
                "At the same time, the Court recognises that the reliance by the prosecutor in the present case on the case-law of the Supreme Court ignored significant differences in the level of gravity of the homophobic speech at stake in this case compared to expressions examined by the Supreme Court in previous judgments which were clearly less grave. As the Government have not provided a single verdict by the Supreme Court showing that the trend of interpretation, which was perceived by the prosecutor as rather lenient towards those accused of hate speech against homosexuals, has been reversed, it does not appear that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to provide greater clarity on the standards to be applied in hate-speech cases of comparable gravity. In that context the Court notes the statutory obligation on the domestic courts to take into account the Supreme Court’s case-law (see also Orlen Lietuva Ltd. v. Lithuania, no. 45849/13, §§ 33-35, 29 January 2019). Accordingly, the Court finds that the manner in which the case-law of the Supreme Court was applied by the prosecutor, whose decision was upheld by the domestic courts which examined the applicants’ case, did not provide for an effective domestic remedy for complaints of homophobic discrimination."

Similarly, on the facts of the case, and taking into account the gravity of the threats uttered by the Internet commenters, the Court has already found that a civil-law remedy, or the referral of such comments to the Inspector (see paragraph 70 above), did not constitute remedies that had to be exhausted (see paragraph 128 above)."

Accordingly, it cannot find, at least in this case, that the failure to establish the identity of those persons and bring them to justice was impossible on account of any technical limitations, even if the Lithuanian authorities had been willing to do so (see paragraph 140 above)."

                "155. The Court cannot but find that the statistics provided both by the Government and the applicants, as well as those by the third-party interveners and international bodies, show otherwise. Firstly, even acknowledging that between 2012 and 2015 some thirty pre-trial investigations regarding homophobic hate speech were opened in Lithuania, one cannot overlook the fact that all of them were discontinued, mostly because the culprits could not be found (see paragraph 139 above). As ECRI noted in 2016, the growing level of intolerance against sexual minorities has remained largely unchecked (see paragraph 56 above). That being so, the Court also gives weight to the applicants’ argument that in view of the law-enforcement authorities’ practice in this regard – and also in response to the outcome of their own case – they had not felt like complaining to the law-enforcement agencies again (see also paragraph 53 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph 59 above). In fact, in the applicants’ case the Regional Court even considered that to open criminal proceedings would have been a “waste of time and resources” (see paragraph 23 above). As put forward by the applicants and the third-party interveners, who also relied on the ECRI report (see paragraphs 136 and 148 above), this prejudicial attitude of the domestic court is fraught with the risk that Article 170 of the Criminal Code could become a “dead letter” that, in the words of the LGL Association, the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply “by giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law” (see paragraph 19 above). Secondly, the Court takes notes of the information regarding the Lithuanian law-enforcement institutions’ failure to acknowledge the bias motivation of such crimes and to take an approach which would be appropriate to the seriousness of the situation (see paragraphs 54 ‑ 55 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph 59 above; see also paragraphs 57-58 of that report, cited in paragraph 60 above). In this connection the Court reiterates that it has already held in Identoba and Others (cited above, § 77) that without such a strict approach on the part of the law-enforcement authorities, prejudice-motivated crimes would unavoidably be treated on an equal footing with ordinary cases without such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official acquiescence or even connivance in hate crimes. Regarding Lithuania, the most recent ECRI materials also show a lack of a comprehensive strategic approach on the part of the authorities to tackle the issue of racist and homophobic hate speech (see paragraph 62 above)."

However, the grounds of the latter type appear to be secondary and inconsequential. Indeed, even if the applicants had successfully contested them or corrected the formal irregularities in the registration documents, their applications for registration would still have been refused with reference to the applicant organisations’ aims. The example of Rainbow House is telling in this respect. Although the applicants corrected the irregularities identified by the registration authority in their first application for registration and resubmitted the application, the registration authority identified new irregularities it had not mentioned the first time. During the judicial review of the second refusal of registration, however, the Regional Court did not rely on any irregularities in the registration documents and limited its assessment to Rainbow House’s aims.

The absence of a European consensus on the question of same-sex marriage is therefore of no relevance to the present case, because conferring substantive rights on homosexual persons is fundamentally different from recognising their right to campaign for such rights. There is no ambiguity about the other member States’ recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 84)."

As regards the next aim advanced by the domestic authorities in their decisions – the aim of protecting Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity – it may be linked to the legitimate aims of the protection of national security and public safety. The Court reiterates that the concepts of “national security” and “public safety” must be applied with restraint and interpreted restrictively (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 54, ECHR 2007 ‑ V, and Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 86, 3 October 2017). It notes that the national authorities considered that the applicant associations threatened Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity because their activities might result in a decrease in the population. The Court is not convinced that a refusal to register an association defending LGBT rights on such grounds may serve to advance the aims of protecting national security and public safety. Firstly, the Court has already found that there was no link between the promotion of homosexuality and the demographic situation, which depends on a multitude of conditions, such as economic prosperity, social-security rights and accessibility of childcare (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 73). Secondly, neither the national courts nor the Government explained how a hypothetical decrease in the population could affect national security and public safety; nor did they provide any assessment of such an impact."

Further, as regards the aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, also advanced by the domestic authorities in their decisions, the Court notes that it is the right not to be confronted with any display of same ‑ sex relations or promotion of LGBT rights or with the idea of equality of different-sex and same-sex relations – which the majority of Russians apparently resented and considered to be offensive, disturbing or shocking – that the national authorities sought to protect by refusing to register the applicant associations."

The Court reiterates in this connection that the Convention does not guarantee the right not to be confronted with opinions that are opposed to one’s own convictions (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 81, with further references). Moreover, it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group’s rights to freedom of religion, expression, assembly and association would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Barankevich v. Russia, no. 10519/03, § 31, 26 July 2007, and Alekseyev, cited above, § 81). The Court has therefore consistently declined to endorse policies and decisions which embodied a predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against a homosexual minority (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 102, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, §§ 34-36, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; and L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, §§ 51-52, ECHR 2003 ‑ I)."

Lastly, as regards the aim of preventing social or religious hatred and enmity incited by the activities of LGBT associations and which might, in the domestic authorities’ opinion, lead to violence, this may correspond to the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder. The Court accepts that social or religious hatred and enmity represents a danger for the social peace and political stability of democratic States (see, mutatis mutandis, Féret v. Belgium, no. 15615/07, §§ 69 and 73, 16 July 2009) and is likely to lead to violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015).

It was never claimed that the applicants themselves intended to commit any violent, aggressive or otherwise disorderly actions.

The Court reiterates in this connection that genuine and effective respect for freedom of association cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 or with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association even in the sphere of relations between individuals. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of associations or political parties, even when they annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the lawful ideas or claims that they are seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, § 37, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts), with further references)."

The positive obligation to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association and assembly is of particular importance for persons holding unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they are more vulnerable to victimisation (see Bączkowski and Others, cited above, § 64). The Court considers that reference to the consciousness of belonging to a minority, the preservation and development of a minority’s culture or the defence of a minority’s rights cannot be said to constitute a threat to “democratic society”, even though it may provoke tensions. The emergence of tensions is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism, that is to say the free discussion of all political ideas. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see, mutatis mutandis, Ouranio Toxo and Others, cited above, § 40; see also Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI)."

It follows that it was the duty of the Russian authorities to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable the applicant organisations to carry out their activities without having to fear that they would be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. The Court observes that the domestic authorities had a wide discretion in the choice of means which would have enabled the applicant organisations to function without disturbance, such as for instance making public statements to advocate, without any ambiguity, a tolerant, conciliatory stance, as well as to warn potential aggressors of possible sanctions (see, for similar reasoning, Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, § 99, 12 May 2015). There is no evidence that the Russian authorities considered taking any such measures. Instead, they decided to remove the cause of tension and avert a risk of disorder by restricting the applicant’s freedom of association. In such circumstances the Court cannot accept that the refusal to register the applicant organisations was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The Court reiterates that the concept of “abuse” within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention must be understood in its ordinary sense according to general legal theory – namely, the harmful exercise of a right for purposes other than those for which it is designed (see Miroļubovs and Others v. Latvia, no. 798/05, § 62, 15 September 2009; Petrović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 56551/11 and 10 other applications, 18 October 2011; and De Luca v. Italy, no. 43870/04, § 35, 24 September 2013)."

Firstly, an application may be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) if it was knowingly based on untrue facts (see Gross v. Switzerland [GC], no. 67810/10, § 28, ECHR 2014, with further references). Secondly, it may also be rejected in cases where an applicant used particularly vexatious, contemptuous, threatening or provocative language in his communication with the Court – whether this was directed against the respondent Government, their Agent, the authorities of the respondent State, the Court itself, its judges, its Registry or members thereof. However, it does not suffice that the applicant’s language was sharp, polemical or sarcastic; to be considered an abuse, it must exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism. If after a warning by the Court the applicant ceased to use the expressions in question, expressly withdrew them or, better still, offered an apology, the application may no longer be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition (see Miroļubovs and Others, cited above, § 64, with further references)."

However, the notion of abuse of the right of application under Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention is not limited to those two instances and other situations can also be considered as an abuse of that right. In principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the Convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the Court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it can be considered as an abuse of the right of application (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 86, 13 April 2017). For example, the Court found that an applicant’s conduct had been contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition in cases where the applicant had lodged a succession of ill-founded and querulous complaints, creating unnecessary work which was incompatible with the Court’s real functions, and which hindered it in carrying them out (see M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 13284/87, Commission decision of 15 October 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; Philis v. Grece, no. 28970/95, Commission decision of 17 October 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; and Petrović, cited above); where the applicant had obtained evidence in support of his case before the Court by force in blatant violation of the rights and the values protected by the Convention (see Koch v. Poland (dec.), no. 15005/11, 7 March 2017); or where the applicant had not meticulously abided by all the relevant rules of the procedure and thereby had failed to show a high level of prudence and meaningful cooperation with the Court (see, for example, Bekauri v. Georgia (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, §§ 22-24, 10 April 2012, and Eskerkhanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18496/16 and 2 others, §§ 23 ‑ 29, 25 July 2017). It also found, in the context of critical statements made by the applicant party’s leader to the press, that “vexing manifestations of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt, might also lead to the rejection of an application as abusive (see The Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia (dec.), no. 9103/04, 22 May 2007).",

The Court notes at the outset that the Government did not name the social networking accounts to which they referred, except by mentioning that they were hosted by Instagram and VKontakte, or indeed cite any of the allegedly insulting statements. Mr Alekseyev, a well-known LGBT activist, is, however, a public figure who has given many interviews to the media and whose social networking accounts have hundreds of followers. These accounts can easily be found by typing his name and the name of the relevant social network in an Internet search engine. They contain personal information about him – for example, that he is an LGBT activist, the head of the GayRussia.Ru project and the founder of the Moscow Pride Movement – and personal photographs, as well as information about his previous and pending cases before the Court, including scanned copies of the Court’s original letters to him. Moreover, while stating that those were not his “personal” accounts, Mr Alekseyev did not deny that he had been the author of the statements concerning the Court published on them."

In particular, Mr Alekseyev published the judges’ photographs with such captions as “alcoholic”, “drug addict”, “corrupt”, and “this crone owes me 100,000 euros ... God will punish her”. He also called the judges, among other terms, “European bastards and degenerates”, “freaks”, “venal scum” and “idiotic”. He wished that they would “snuff it as soon as possible like dogs”, threatened to “torture [them] ... with litres of vodka” and announced that “it [was] time to set fire to the European Court of Human Rights”. He also stated: “We should not have given wenches the right to vote ... They should be cooking soup”. These statements clearly exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism."

The Court takes note of the fact that the above comments were made in reaction to the Court’s judgment in the case of Alekseyev and Others (cited above), that is outside the context of the present case. However, it also takes into account that, by publishing the impugned statements on social networking accounts accessible to all, Mr Alekseyev sought to ensure the widest possible circulation of his accusations and insults and thereby provided evidence of his determination to harm and tarnish the image and reputation of the institution of the European Court of Human Rights and its members (see Duringer and Grunge c. France (dec.), nos. 61164/00 and 18589/02, 4 February 2003, and Řehák v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 67208/01, 18 May 2004). The Court therefore sent a letter to Mr Alekseyev referring to all his pending applications and warning him that such statements might amount to an abuse of right of petition. Mr Alekseyev has not however withdrawn his statements which are still visible on his social networking accounts. Most importantly, he has since published new offensive statements about the Court, in particular describing it as “a rubbish heap” and calling its judges “European corrupt scum” and “homophobic”. These statements published after the warning that explicitly mentioned the present applications can therefore be considered to be connected with them."

The Court considers that by continuing to publish insults about the Court and its judges after the warning, the applicant has shown disrespect to the very institution to which he had applied for the protection of his rights. Indeed, it is unacceptable to seek the protection of a court in which the applicant has lost all trust. His conduct constitutes “a vexing manifestation of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt (see The Georgian Labour Party, cited above), and is therefore contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application, as provided for in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention.

The applicants’ argument that the time-limit had started to run on 5 March 2012, when a copy of the reasoned judgment had been deposited with the court’s registry, was therefore erroneous. The applicants had been informed about the hearing of 20 February 2012 but had not attended. A copy of the judgment had been sent to them on 27 February 2012. They had not submitted to the District Court any documents, such as a stamped envelope, showing the date on which they had received it. They had not even claimed, let alone proved, that there had been a delay in providing them with a copy of the judgment of 20 February 2012. Nor had they asked for an extension of the time-limit.

The role of the Court is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the filing of documents or the lodging of appeals. Rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal are aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty.

The Court notes that under Russian law, public associations, such as Rainbow House and Sochi Pride House, can exist without registration, whereas non-profit organisations, such as Movement for Marriage Equality, are considered to exist from the moment of State registration only. However, the Court’s case-law does not make any distinction between applicant organisations on the basis of whether they legally exist under the national law at the moment their application is lodged with the Court. The Court has frequently recognised the standing of unregistered or dissolved organisations to submit an application without enquiring into whether the organisation is considered to legally exist in some form under the national law after its dissolution or refusal of registration (see, among many other authorities, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, §§ 49-50, ECHR 2003 ‑ II; Republican Party of Russia v. Russia, no. 12976/07, §§ 91 and 100, 1 April 2011; Sindicatul “Păstorul cel Bun” v.

They might therefore destroy society’s moral values and, by decreasing the population, negatively affect Russian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Rainbow House’s activities might as a result undermine the safety of Russian society and the State. They might also jeopardise the constitutionally protected institutions of family and marriage.

Firstly, its name contained words in a foreign language. Such names were only allowed for commercial organisations and could not be used for non-commercial ones. The applicants’ argument that foreign words were often used in the names of non-commercial organisations had been misconceived because those organisations had been registered before 2006, when registration had been performed by the tax authorities, which had no competence to verify whether an organisation’s name was compatible with Russian law. There had also been other irregularities in the documents submitted for registration. The domestic courts had confirmed that the refusal of registration had been lawful. They had found, in particular, that the aims of Sochi Pride House had been incompatible with basic morality and State family policy and that its activities would amount to propaganda of non ‑ traditional sexual orientation. Such activities might undermine Russian national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity and incite social and religious hatred and enmity; they were therefore extremist in nature. In the Government’s opinion, there was no need to submit any proof for the finding that LGBT advocacy might lead to a decrease in population. Given the nature of childbearing, it was absurd to deny it. The Government also submitted that propaganda of non ‑ traditional sexual relations aimed at minors was an administrative offence.

In any event, given that the authorities had found that the associations’ aims had been contrary to Russian law, the additional reasons relating to the purely technical irregularities in the documents had been insignificant.

In a democratic society a call to respect the rights of a minority could never be considered contrary to public morals. The Court had repeatedly stated that a democratic society was pluralistic, tolerant and broadminded (they referred to Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 63, 3 May 2007), and those principles were especially important when people were expressing unpopular or minority views.

Such a debate would benefit social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views were heard, including the individuals concerned.

The Court had, however, since changed that approach, finding that an association could be established to pursue a change in the law, including the legalisation of conduct that was illegal, so long as the means to be used and the outcome to be achieved were compatible with fundamental democratic principles, including in particular non-discrimination, pluralism and respect for human rights (the interveners cited United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

Any such limitations had to be understood in the light of the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination. Accordingly, even if the government or some parts of society opposed certain activities on moral grounds, that was not in itself sufficient to justify restrictions on those activities, particularly if they were protected by the Convention or other human rights standards (the interveners cited, for example, Sidiropoulos and Others v.

Indeed, even if the applicants had successfully contested them or corrected the formal irregularities in the registration documents, their applications for registration would still have been refused with reference to the applicant organisations’ aims. The example of Rainbow House is telling in this respect. Although the applicants corrected the irregularities identified by the registration authority in their first application for registration and resubmitted the application, the registration authority identified new irregularities it had not mentioned the first time. During the judicial review of the second refusal of registration, however, the Regional Court did not rely on any irregularities in the registration documents and limited its assessment to Rainbow House’s aims.

Although States are still free, under Article 12 of the Convention as well as under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, to restrict access to marriage to different-sex couples (see, as the most recent authority, Orlandi and Others v. Italy, nos. 26431/12 and 3 others, § 192, 14 December 2017, with further references), the issue in the present case is not whether same-sex marriage should be recognised in Russia.

There is no ambiguity about the other member States’ recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 84)."

As regards the next aim advanced by the domestic authorities in their decisions – the aim of protecting Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity – it may be linked to the legitimate aims of the protection of national security and public safety. The Court reiterates that the concepts of “national security” and “public safety” must be applied with restraint and interpreted restrictively (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 54, ECHR 2007 ‑ V, and Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 86, 3 October 2017). It notes that the national authorities considered that the applicant associations threatened Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity because their activities might result in a decrease in the population. The Court is not convinced that a refusal to register an association defending LGBT rights on such grounds may serve to advance the aims of protecting national security and public safety. Firstly, the Court has already found that there was no link between the promotion of homosexuality and the demographic situation, which depends on a multitude of conditions, such as economic prosperity, social-security rights and accessibility of childcare (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 73). Secondly, neither the national courts nor the Government explained how a hypothetical decrease in the population could affect national security and public safety; nor did they provide any assessment of such an impact."

Moreover, it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group’s rights to freedom of religion, expression, assembly and association would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Barankevich v. Russia, no. 10519/03, § 31, 26 July 2007, and Alekseyev, cited above, § 81).

There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association even in the sphere of relations between individuals. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of associations or political parties, even when they annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the lawful ideas or claims that they are seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v.

The emergence of tensions is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism, that is to say the free discussion of all political ideas. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see, mutatis mutandis, Ouranio Toxo and Others, cited above, § 40; see also Serif v.

For pluralism is also built on genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs and artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV, and Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236 ). However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 ‑ 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). When exercising their freedom of expression they may be required to show restraint, bearing in mind that their views can be regarded as instructions by civil servants whose employment and careers depend on their approval."

                "“ ... Regarding the grounds for refusing Ms B. authorisation:",
                "Firstly, the fact that a request for authorisation to adopt a child is submitted by a single person, as is permitted by Article 343-1 of the Civil Code, does not prevent the administrative authority from ascertaining, in terms of child-rearing and psychological factors that foster the development of the child's personality, whether the prospective adoptive parent can offer – in her circle of family and friends – a paternal “ role model or referent ” where the application is submitted by a woman ...; nor, where a single person seeking to adopt is in a stable relationship with another person, who will inevitably be required to contribute to providing the child with a suitable home for the purposes of the above-mentioned provisions, does this fact prevent the authority from determining – even if the relationship in question is not a legally binding one – whether the conduct or personality of the third person, considered on the basis of objective considerations, is conducive to providing a suitable home. Accordingly, the Administrative Court of Appeal did not err in law in considering that the two grounds on which the application by Ms [B.] for authorisation as a single person was refused – namely, the “ absence of identificational markers due to the lack of a paternal role model or referent ” and “the ambivalence of the commitment of each member of the household to the adoptive child” – were capable of justifying, under the above-mentioned provisions of the decree of 1 September 1998, the refusal to grant authorisation;",
                "Secondly, with regard to Ms [B.]'s assertion that, in referring to her “ lifestyle ” to justify the refusal to grant her authorisation to adopt, the Administrative Court of Appeal had implicitly referred to her sexual orientation, it can be seen from the documents submitted to the tribunals of fact that Ms [B.] was, at the time of the examination of her application, in a stable homosexual relationship. As that relationship had to be taken into consideration in the needs and interests of an adopted child, the court neither based its decision on a position of principle in view of the applicant's sexual orientation nor breached the combined requirements of Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; nor did it breach the provisions of Article L. 225-2 of the Criminal Code prohibiting sexual discrimination;",
                "Thirdly, in considering that Ms [B.], “ having regard to her lifestyle and despite her undoubted personal qualities and aptitude for bringing up children, did not provide the requisite safeguards – from a family, child-rearing and psychological perspective – for adopting a child ”, the Administrative Court of Appeal, which did not disregard the elements favourable to the applicant in the file submitted to it, did not distort the contents of the file;",

The Government cited decisions of the domestic courts in support of their submission that any other heterosexual applicant whose immediate circle of family and friends did not include a member of the opposite sex would have had their application refused on the same ground."

They observed that the applicant continued to deny the relevance of that fact, whereas it was legitimate to have regard to the conduct of a prospective adoptive parent's immediate circle of family and friends where there were plans to bring a child into the home. Irrespective of the lack of legal consequences for the partner, the arrival of a child would change the balance of the receiving couple and the family unit, and an adopted child's previous history made it all the more important to assess the solidity of a couple's approach to any plan to adopt. Accordingly, apart from the fact that R. would necessarily be involved in the child's day-to-day life, her lack of involvement could be seen as a source of insecurity for the child with the risk that the child would find him or herself in competition with the applicant's partner for the applicant's time and affection. In the Government's submission, that ground could not be said to be related to the applicant's sexual orientation, as had been borne out by the decisions of the domestic courts."

In the Government's view, the circumstances of the present case were therefore very different from those in Fretté ( cited above) and it should be stressed that the French administrative and judicial authorities had given paramount consideration to what lay in the best interests of the child. Those best interests were central to many international instruments binding on France. There was no right to a child or right to authorisation to adopt one. Adoption was a measure taken for the child's protection and was designed to provide him or her with a family. The sole purpose of the authorisation procedure was to identify from among the many candidates the person who could provide a child with the most suitable home in every respect. Accordingly, the desire for a child must not prevail over the child's interests."

Neither party contests this. The right to respect for “ family life ” does not safeguard the mere desire to found a family; it presupposes the existence of a family ( see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, § 31), or at the very least the potential relationship between, for example, a child born out of wedlock and his or her natural father ( see Nylund v. Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI ), or the relationship that arises from a genuine marriage, even if family life has not yet been fully established ( see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, § 62), or the relationship that arises from a lawful and genuine adoption ( see Pini and Others v.

Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, § 85, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights protected by the Convention. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the Articles of the Convention ( see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, § 71; Karlheinz Schmidt v.

This principle is well entrenched in the Court's case-law ( see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium ” v.

Accordingly, the Court considers that the facts of this case undoubtedly fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. Consequently, the State, which has gone beyond its obligations under Article 8 in creating such a right – a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention – cannot, in the application of that right, take discriminatory measures within the meaning of Article 14 ( see, mutatis mutandis, Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium ”, cited above )."

The Government justified the failure to produce studies identifying problems or differences in development in children raised by homosexual couples by the fact that the number of children raised by a homosexual couple was unknown and the estimated numbers highly variable. Besides the complexity of the various situations that might be encountered, the existing studies were insufficiently thorough because they were based on insufficiently large samples, failed to take a detached approach and did not indicate the profile of the single-parent families in question. Child psychiatrists or psychoanalysts defended different theories, with a majority arguing that a dual maternal and paternal referent in the home was necessary."

France (cited above) the Chamber held that the decisions to reject the application for authorisation had pursued a legitimate aim, namely to protect the health and rights of children who could be involved in an adoption procedure (§ 38). With regard to whether a difference in treatment was justified, and after observing that there was no common ground between the legal systems of the Contracting States, the Chamber found it quite natural that the national authorities should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when they were asked to make rulings on such matters, subject to review by the Court (§ 41). Having regard to the competing interests of the applicant and children who were eligible for adoption, and to the paramountcy of the latter's best interests, it noted that the scientific community was divided over the possible consequences of a child being adopted by one or more homosexual parents, that there were wide differences in national and international opinion and that there were not enough children to adopt to satisfy demand (§ 42). Taking account of the broad margin of appreciation to be left to States in this area and to the need to protect children's best interests to achieve the desired balance, the Chamber considered that the refusal to authorise adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and that, accordingly, the justification given by the Government appeared objective and reasonable and the difference in treatment complained of was not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (§§ 42 and 43)."

The Court notes that the present case also concerns the question of how an application for authorisation to adopt submitted by a homosexual single person is dealt with; it nonetheless differs in a number of respects from the above-cited case of Fretté. The Court notes in particular that whilst the ground relating to the lack of a referent of the other sex features in both cases, the domestic administrative authorities did not – expressly at least – refer to E.B.'s “choice of lifestyle” (see Fretté, cited above, § 32). Furthermore, they also mentioned the applicant's qualities and her child-raising and emotional capacities, unlike in Fretté where the applicant was deemed to have had difficulties in envisaging the practical consequences of the upheaval occasioned by the arrival of a child (§§ 28 and 29). Moreover, in the instant case the domestic authorities had regard to the attitude of E.B.'s partner, with whom she had stated that she was in a stable and permanent relationship, which was a factor that had not featured in the application lodged by Mr Fretté."

With regard to the ground relied on by the domestic authorities relating to the lack of a paternal or maternal referent in the household of a person seeking authorisation to adopt, the Court considers that this does not necessarily raise a problem in itself. However, in the circumstances of the present case it is permissible to question the merits of such a ground, the ultimate effect of which is to require the applicant to establish the presence of a referent of the other sex among her immediate circle of family and friends, thereby running the risk of rendering ineffective the right of single persons to apply for authorisation. The point is germane here because the case does not concern an application for authorisation to adopt by a – married or unmarried – couple, but by a single person. In the Court's view, that ground might therefore have led to an arbitrary refusal and have served as a pretext for rejecting the applicant's application on grounds of her homosexuality."

Austria, no. 40016/98, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ), were unable to produce statistical information on the frequency of reliance on that ground according to the – declared or known – sexual orientation of the persons applying for adoption, which alone could provide an accurate picture of administrative practice and establish the absence of discrimination when relying on that ground."

Although she was the long-standing and declared partner of the applicant, Ms R. did not feel committed by her partner's application to adopt. The authorities, which constantly remarked on this point – expressly and giving reasons – concluded that the applicant did not provide the requisite safeguards for adopting a child."

It should first be noted that, contrary to the applicant's submissions, the question of the attitude of her partner, with whom she stated that she was in a stable and lasting relationship, is not without interest or relevance in assessing her application. It is legitimate for the authorities to ensure that all safeguards are in place before a child is taken into a family. Accordingly, where a male or female applicant, although unmarried, has already set up home with a partner, that partner's attitude and the role he or she will necessarily play on a daily basis in the life of the child joining the home set-up require a full examination in the child's best interests. It would moreover be surprising, to say the least, if the relevant authorities, having been informed of the existence of a de facto couple, pretended to be unaware of that fact when assessing the conditions in which the child would be given a home and his future life in that new home. The legal status of a person seeking to adopt is not incompatible with an examination of his or her actual situation and the subsequent finding of not one but two adults in the household."

The importance of these safeguards – of which the authorities must be satisfied before authorising a person to adopt a child – can also be seen in the relevant international instruments, be it the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989, the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 or the draft European Convention on the Adoption of Children ( see paragraphs 29-31 above )."

It added that the documents in the file and the conclusions reached after examining the application showed that the applicant's lifestyle did not provide the requisite safeguards for adopting a child, but disputed that the president of the council for the département had refused authorisation on the basis of a position of principle regarding her choice of lifestyle, namely, her homosexuality ( see paragraph 24 above )."

Besides their considerations regarding the applicant's “ lifestyle ”, they above all confirmed the decision of the president of the council for the département. The Court points out that the latter reached his decision in the light of the opinion given by the adoption board whose various members had expressed themselves individually in writing, mainly recommending, with reasons in support of that recommendation, that the application be refused on the basis of the two grounds in question. It observes that the manner in which certain opinions were expressed was indeed revealing in that the applicant's homosexuality was a determining factor. In particular, the Court notes that in his opinion of 12 October 1998 the psychologist from the children's welfare service recommended that authorisation be refused, referring to, among other things, an “ unusual attitude [ on the part of the applicant ] to men in that men are rejected” (see paragraph 13 above)."

This emerges particularly clearly from the conclusions of the psychologist who, in her report on her interviews with the applicant of 28 August 1998, stated, with express reference to the applicant's case and not as a general comment – since she prefaces her remark with the statement that she is not seeking to diminish the applicant's confidence in herself or to insinuate that she would be harmful to a child – that “all the studies on parenthood show that a child needs both its parents ” ( see paragraph 11 above ). On 28 October 1998 the adoption board's representative from the Family Council for the association of children currently or formerly in State care recommended refusing authorisation on the ground that an adoptive family had to be composed “ of a mixed couple ( man and woman ) ” ( see paragraph 14 above )."

She considered that there had been no grounds for a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation and that the relevant law should not be construed in a manner that allowed for such a possibility. She relied, inter alia, on the Constitution and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, arguing that even if she was not to be considered as D.B. ’ s “immediate family member”, within the meaning of the Aliens Act, she should in any case be considered as her “ other relative ” within the meaning of that Act."

It should also be taken into account that the provisions of the Aliens Act concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [the existence of] a same-sex union, nor does such a union fall within the scope of [the term] ‘ immediate family member ’ incorporated in that Act, which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant.",

It should be noted that section 56 of the [Aliens] Act explicitly enumerates persons who are to be considered immediate family members or who are to be exceptionally considered [so], which leads to a conclusion that it cannot be extended to cover persons living in a same-sex union.",

In the Government ’ s view, the Prevention of Discrimination Act provided for effective domestic remedies, which must have been known to the applicant, who was duly represented by lawyers. The effectiveness of the legal remedy under the Prevention of Discrimination Act followed from the practice of the domestic courts and had moreover been recognised by the Constitutional Court, which had therefore declared the applicant ’ s constitutional complaint inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. In addition, the Government referred to the fact that the Prevention of Discrimination Act also provided an alternative avenue under section 16, allowing an individual to raise his or her discrimination complaint as a preliminary issue in the main proceedings, but they considered that the applicant had failed to raise that matter properly in the administrative proceedings concerning her request for family reunification."

Any possible argument concerning the protection of family in the traditional sense was inapplicable in this context since there had been various other less restrictive means for achieving that aim. The applicant also stressed that her request for a residence permit on the ground of family reunification with her partner had been dismissed at the outset since the relevant domestic law per se excluded the possibility of family reunification of same-sex couples.

In the Government ’ s view, in the case at issue the applicant had failed to demonstrate that she had had family life with D.B. In particular, she had not lived with D.B. or otherwise demonstrated their mutual commitment to a family life. The fact that she wanted to move and live with D.B. and to start their common business could not amount to the recognition of a de facto family life. Moreover, the Government did not wish to speculate as to whether the matter concerned the applicant ’ s private life, since the right to a residence permit in Croatia could not be considered under the applicant ’ s right to respect for her private life.

It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 71, Series A no. 94; and E.B. v.

Austria, no. 30141/04, § 91, ECHR 2010). In contrast, the Court ’ s case-law has for a long time only accepted that the emotional and sexual relationship of a same-sex couple constitutes “private life” but has not found that it constitutes “family life”, even where a long - term relationship of cohabiting partners was at stake. In coming to that conclusion, the Court observed that despite the growing tendency in a number of European States towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto same-sex partnerships, given the existence of little common ground between the Contracting States, this was an area in which they still enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation (see Mata Estevez, cited above, with further references)."

Since then, a considerable number of member States have afforded legal recognition to same-sex couples. Certain provisions of European Union law also reflect a growing tendency to include same-sex couples in the notion of “family” (see paragraphs 36-37 above). In view of this evolution, the Court considered it artificial to maintain the view that, in contrast to a different-sex couple, a same-sex couple could not enjoy “family life” for the purposes of Article 8. It therefore held that the relationship of a cohabiting same-sex couple living in a stable de facto partnership fell within the notion of “family life”, just as the relationship of a different-sex couple in the same situation would (see P.B. and J.S. v.

With regard to the Government ’ s argument that the applicant was not in a comparable situation to different-sex couples living in an extramarital relationship given that she had not been in a relationship with D.B. for a period of three years, the Court firstly notes that when dismissing the applicant ’ s action the Administrative Court did not carry out any investigation into the circumstances of the case nor did it deal with the question of the relevance of the period in which the applicant was in a relationship with D.B. for its decision concerning her request for family reunification. Instead, it relied on the legal impossibility argument alone, finding that it was not possible under the limitations imposed by the Aliens Act to grant the applicant ’ s request (see paragraph 14 above). It also follows from the decision of the Ministry that the legal impossibility of obtaining a residence permit for family reunification by a partner in a same-sex relationship was at the centre of the domestic authorities ’ considerations (see paragraph 12 above; and compare X and Others v. Austria, cited above, §§ 118-119 and 123)."

Nevertheless, as already noted above, the Administrative Court did not consider it pertinent to examine the relevant factual aspects of the applicant ’ s case as it relied on the legal impossibility of obtaining a residence permit for family reunification by a partner in a same-sex relationship. This accordingly prevents the Court from speculating what would be the possible Administrative Court ’ s decision if it had considered that the family reunification of same-sex couples was possible under the relevant domestic law."

Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 or any other Convention provision cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to, for instance, authorise family reunion in its territory (see Jeunesse, cited above, § 107; and Gül v. Switzerland, 19 February 1996, § 38, Reports 1996 ‑ I; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 38, ECHR 2011).

Indeed, it is the Court ’ s well-established case-law that although Article 8 does not include a right to settle in a particular country or a right to obtain a residence permit, the State must nevertheless exercise its immigration policies in a manner which is compatible with a foreign national ’ s human rights, in particular the right to respect for his or her private or family life and the right not to be subject to discrimination (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, §§ 59-60; Kiyutin, cited above, § 53). Even in cases in which the State that has gone beyond its obligations under Article 8 in creating a right – a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention – it cannot, in the application of that right, take discriminatory measures within the meaning of Article 14 (see, for instance, E.B. v.

It further noted that the position of women left without any support after a long period of cohabitation, and the phenomenon of single-parent families generally, were major issues which called for a legislative response. However, the report pointed out that the status of religious marriage remained unparalleled and, alongside civil marriage, represented the best option for couples wishing to found a family with a maximum of legal, financial and social safeguards. The report also made reference to Article 8 of the Convention, which protected non-marital unions from the standpoint of the right to private and family life, and observed that a number of European countries afforded legal recognition to some form of registered partnership for different-sex or same-sex couples. Without elaborating further, it noted that civil unions were reserved for different-sex adults. It concluded that they represented a new form of partnership and not a kind of “flexible marriage”.

At present there is very limited legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the sense that marriage is not available to same-sex couples. The domestic laws of the majority of states presuppose, in other words, that the intending spouses are of different sexes. Nevertheless, in a few countries, e.g., in the Netherlands and in Belgium, marriage between people of the same sex is legally recognized. Others, like the Nordic countries, have endorsed a registered partnership legislation, which implies, among other things, that most provisions concerning marriage, i.e. its legal consequences such as property distribution, rights of inheritance, etc., are also applicable to these unions. At the same time it is important to point out that the name ‘registered partnership’ has intentionally been chosen not to confuse it with marriage and it has been established as an alternative method of recognizing personal relationships. This new institution is, consequently, as a rule only accessible to couples who cannot marry, and the same ‑ sex partnership does not have the same status and the same benefits as marriage. ...",

Moreover, the individual applicants could not be considered as victims of the alleged violation from the standpoint of Articles 14 and 8, as they did not suffer direct and immediate adverse consequences as a result of their inability to enter into a civil union. By way of example, the Government observed that the payment of maintenance following the dissolution of a civil union was optional under section 6 of Law no. 3719/2008. Furthermore, the applicants were in any case free to enter into a contract within each couple laying down obligations and reciprocal rights in that regard. As to partners’ inheritance rights, the Government conceded that section 11 of the Law at issue provided for the surviving partner in a civil union to inherit on intestacy. However, the applicants, in view of their age (the oldest of them was still under sixty), could be regarded only as hypothetical victims of the alleged violation.

In sum, those applicants who were private individuals did not have victim status because the harm they claimed to have suffered with regard to the right to potential maintenance payments, inheritance arrangements and the regulation of financial issues within each couple was hypothetical and based on speculation."

Under that provision, the State was obliged to provide redress for damage caused by the acts or omissions of its organs in the exercise of public authority. The sole condition was that the act or omission had to be unlawful, that is to say, it had to infringe a rule of law establishing a specific individual right or interest. In the present case the applicants could have complained before the domestic courts under Articles 57, 914 and 932 of the Civil Code, read together with section 105 of the Introductory Law, of a breach of their personality rights and of their social marginalisation on account of their exclusion as same-sex couples from the scope of Law no. 3719/2008. In the Government’s view, this remedy would have enabled the applicants to claim compensation for any damage caused by the impugned legislation and at the same time to challenge its constitutionality. They observed that, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the latter could interpret the constitutional principle of equality broadly, extending a legislative provision favourable to a specific category of persons to cover another category in a similar situation. As authority, the Government cited two judgments of the Court of Cassation (nos. 60/2002 and 9/2004) concerning the salaries and allowances of different categories of employees, an issue that the court had examined from the standpoint of the equality principle."

They pointed out that, under Article 28 of the Constitution, the provisions of international treaties took precedence over domestic-law provisions once they had been ratified by the legislature, and that Legislative Decree no. 53/1974 had ratified the Convention in domestic law. They cited, among other authorities, certain judgments by the Supreme Administrative Court, the Court of Cassation and the Court of Audit in which those courts had conducted an incidental review of the conformity of various legislative provisions with the Greek Constitution and/or Articles 7, 11 and 12 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Furthermore, the applicants pointed out that notaries in Greece were members of a liberal profession. Consequently, any legal action before the administrative courts would have no prospect of success since notaries were not agents of the State. As to an action in the civil courts, that would have no greater chance of success, as a notary who refused to draw up a notarised instrument in respect of a same-sex couple would not incur any liability in tort as a result.

For that reason, any compensation that might be awarded by the domestic courts would in no way alleviate their feeling of exclusion and social marginalisation caused by Law no. 3719/2008.

They submitted, firstly, that the case-law of the domestic courts cited by the Government by no means accepted that the State was civilly liable whenever a law was held to be contrary to a higher-ranking legal rule. Whether in the context of the Constitution or an international convention, the administrative courts were still very hesitant about establishing a general principle limiting the legislature’s margin of appreciation. Secondly, the applicants contended that the case-law cited by the Government was not relevant since it bore no relation to the present case. This was particularly so since the case-law of the domestic courts was much more restrictive than that of the Court with regard to the notion of “family”. The applicants cited Court of Cassation judgment no. 1141/2007, which had explicitly excluded the deceased’s partner from his “family”."

In other words, even in the hypothetical case that an action for damages under section 105 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code were to succeed in the domestic courts, the administrative authorities would be under no obligation to amend the impugned legislation.",

The Court reiterates that, in order to rely on Article 34 of the Convention, an applicant must meet two conditions: he or she must fall into one of the categories of petitioners mentioned in Article 34 and must be able to make out a case that he or she is the victim of a violation of the Convention. According to the Court’s established case-law, the concept of “victim” must be interpreted autonomously and irrespective of domestic concepts such as those concerning an interest or capacity to act (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, § 35, ECHR 2004-III). The word “victim”, in the context of Article 34 of the Convention, denotes the person or persons directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation (see SARL du Parc d’Activités de Blotzheim v. France, no. 72377/01, § 20, 11 July 2006). Hence, Article 34 concerns not just the direct victim or victims of the alleged violation, but also any indirect victims to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end (see, mutatis mutandis, Defalque v. Belgium, no. 37330/02, § 46, 20 April 2006, and Tourkiki Enosi Xanthis and Others v. Greece, no. 26698/05, § 38, 27 March 2008)."

However, the complaints raised by the present case relate to the fact that section 1 of Law no. 3719/2008 does not afford individuals of the same sex the possibility of entering into a civil union. Consequently, in so far as the seventh applicant in application no. 32648/09 is a legal entity, it cannot be considered in the instant case as a direct or indirect “victim” within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Fédération chrétienne des témoins de Jéhovah de France v.

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI, and Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, §§ 96-98, ECHR 2000-XI). It observes that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires applicants – using the legal remedies available in domestic law in so far as they are effective and adequate – to afford the Contracting States the possibility of putting right the violations alleged against them before bringing the matter before the Court (see, among other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v.

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 107, 10 September 2010). The existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV). Lastly, an applicant who has availed himself of a remedy capable of redressing the situation giving rise to the alleged violation, directly and not merely indirectly, is not bound to have recourse to other remedies which would have been available to him but the effectiveness of which is questionable (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 33, Reports 1996-IV, and Anakomba Yula v. Belgium, no. 45413/07, § 22, 10 March 2009)."

Firstly, the Court observes that the remedy referred to by the Government merely provides for the person concerned to obtain redress in respect of an act or omission by the State in the exercise of public authority. Accordingly, any review of the constitutionality of a law is carried out by the competent court as an incidental issue, with a view to determining whether the State must afford redress to the individual for an infringement of a rule of law establishing a specific individual right or interest. In the instant case, however, the applicants complain of a continuing violation of Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention on account of their inability, as same ‑ sex couples, to enter into civil unions, whereas legislation exists affording that possibility to different-sex couples. Hence, a mere award of financial compensation would not appear capable of remedying their grievances."

In particular, the Court notes that none of the judgments of the highest courts in Greece cited by the Government concerned an issue comparable to that raised in the instant case, that is to say, the unconstitutionality of a statute on account of its discriminatory nature with regard to the right to private or family life. This is particularly true since none of the judgments in question examined the issue of compensation for the claimants on account of the incompatibility of a law with Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention."

A State pleading non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must, however, demonstrate the existence of effective and sufficient domestic remedies (see Soto Sanchez v.

They contended that, although European countries’ legislation on the issue was not entirely uniform, there was nevertheless a trend towards legal recognition of same-sex couples. The applicants observed that, to their knowledge, Greece was to date the only European country to have introduced a legal alternative to marriage that was confined to different-sex couples. In other words, Greece was the only country to have enacted legislation governing a form of civil partnership while under the same legislation excluding same-sex couples from its scope. Greece was thus clearly and radically out of step with the norm among European countries in that regard. The applicants argued that the wish to preserve the ties of the traditional heterosexual family could not constitute substantive grounds such as to justify treating same-sex couples differently. Instead of taking positive steps to overcome prejudice against gays and lesbians in Greek society, the respondent State had reinforced that prejudice by enacting Law no. 3719/2008 without including same-sex couples. In the applicants’ view, the Law in question cast a negative moral judgment on homosexuality as it reflected an unjustifiable reserve, not to say hostility, towards same-sex couples. Having decided to move away from marriage as the sole formal basis of family life, the legislature had shown a clear disregard for same-sex couples by excluding them from the scope of Law no. 3719/2008."

In the applicants’ view, it was clear that the legislation in question was designed to regulate the situation of couples who did not wish to marry, irrespective of whether or not they had or wished to have children. Hence, they considered that their exclusion from the scope of the legislation lacked any objective and reasonable justification and was therefore discriminatory."

The Government observed that, with regard to the legitimate aims pursued by Law no. 3719/2008, the legislation on civil unions should be viewed as a set of provisions allowing parents to raise their biological children in such a way that the father had an equitable share of parental responsibility without the couple being obliged to marry. Civil unions therefore meant that, when the woman became pregnant, the couple no longer had to marry out of fear that they would not otherwise have the legal relationship they desired with their child since he or she would be regarded as being born out of wedlock. Hence, by introducing civil unions the Greek legislature had shown itself to be both traditional and modern in its thinking. By enacting Law no. 3719/2008, the legislature had sought to strengthen the institutions of marriage and the family in the traditional sense, since the decision to marry would henceforth be taken irrespective of the prospect of having a child and thus purely on the basis of a mutual commitment entered into by two individuals of different sex, free of outside constraints."

Greek law differed in that respect from the legislation in other European countries providing for civil unions. The Greek legislature had stated expressly in the explanatory report on the Law that it was not seeking to regulate all forms of de facto partnership but rather to protect children born to different-sex couples in such partnerships, as well as the parents themselves if they did not wish to marry. In the Government’s view, the whole structure of the Law and the content of its provisions were designed to reflect this. Consequently, the introduction of civil unions for same-sex couples would require a separate set of rules governing a situation which was analogous to, but not the same as, the situation of different-sex couples."

In particular, Article 1444 of the Civil Code made reference to “ de facto partnership[s]”. Under that provision, divorced persons who remarried or lived in a de facto partnership lost the right to maintenance payments. De facto partnerships were also mentioned in Articles 1456 and 1457 of the Civil Code concerning assisted reproduction. Article 1456 provided that, if an unmarried woman sought recourse to assisted reproduction techniques, the man with whom she lived in a de facto partnership had to give his consent before a notary.

First of all, the Government urged the Court to make a distinction between the applicants who cohabited and those who did not.

With regard to property issues, the Government reiterated their arguments concerning the admissibility ratione personae of the complaint. They observed that civil unions did not produce any automatic and binding effects with regard to the partners’ property status. As to social security matters, same-sex couples were in an identical position to different-sex couples who decided to enter into a union.

The Government referred in particular to sections 9 and 10 of Law no. 3719/2008, which enabled the father of a child born outside marriage to establish paternity and be involved in the child’s upbringing without having to be married to the child’s mother. Hence, marriage and the recognition of paternity by the courts or by the father himself no longer constituted the sole means of establishing paternity. The Government stressed that the object of the provisions in question represented the “hard core” of the legislation on civil unions and, by definition, could apply only to different-sex couples. On the basis of that argument, the Government contended that the present case should not lead the Court to find a violation of Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention.

The third-party interveners observed that a growing number of national courts, both in Europe and elsewhere, required that unmarried different-sex and same-sex couples be treated in the same way. A large number of Council of Europe member States had now enacted legislation recognising same-sex relationships. To their knowledge, the case of Greece was unique, as it was the only European country to have introduced civil unions while excluding same-sex couples from their scope of application. The relevant legislation of the Contracting States on registered civil partnerships for same-sex couples was founded on two models: (a) the “Danish model”, based on the Danish legislation introduced in 1989, which confined the registration scheme to same-sex couples, since different ‑ sex couples already had the option of marrying, and (b) the “French model”, whereby the right to enter into a civil partnership was open to all unmarried couples irrespective of their sexual orientation.",

Accordingly, the Court is of the view that the applicants’ relationships in the present case fall within the notion of “private life” and that of “family life”, just as would the relationships of different-sex couples in the same situation. It can see no basis for drawing the distinction requested by the Government (see paragraph 65 in fine above) between those applicants who live together and those who – for professional and social reasons – do not (see paragraph 8 above), since in the instant case the fact of not cohabiting does not deprive the couples concerned of the stability which brings them within the scope of family life within the meaning of Article 8."

In the instant case the applicants complain that Law no. 3719/2008 provides for civil unions for different-sex couples only, thereby automatically excluding same-sex couples from its scope. In other words, the applicants’ complaint is not that the Greek State failed to comply with any positive obligation which might be imposed on it by the Convention, but that it introduced a distinction, by virtue of Law no. 3719/2008, which in their view discriminates against them. Accordingly, the issue to be determined in the instant case is whether the Greek State was entitled, from the standpoint of Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention, to enact a law introducing alongside the institution of marriage a new registered partnership scheme for unmarried couples that was limited to different-sex couples and thus excluded same-sex couples.",

Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008; Schalk and Kopf, cited above, § 96; and X and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 98). The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 82, Series A no. 94)."

Austria, § 45; and X and Others v. Austria, § 99, all cited above). Where a difference in treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation the State’s margin of appreciation is narrow (see Karner, § 41, and Kozak, § 92, both cited above).

The Court reiterates that same-sex couples are just as capable as different-sex couples of entering into stable committed relationships (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, § 99).

                "80. The Court observes that the Government relied chiefly on two sets of arguments to justify the legislature’s choice not to include same-sex couples in the scope of Law no. 3719/2008. Firstly, they contended that if the civil unions introduced by that Law were applied to the applicants, this would result for them in rights and obligations – in terms of their property status, the financial relations within each couple and their inheritance rights – for which they could already provide a legal framework under ordinary law, that is to say, on a contractual basis. Secondly, the Government argued that the legislation in question was designed to achieve several goals: protecting children born outside marriage, protecting single-parent families (as made clear in the explanatory report to the Law), responding to the wishes of parents to raise their children without being obliged to marry and, ultimately, strengthening the institutions of marriage and the family in the traditional sense."
            ],
            [
                "81. As regards the first argument advanced by the Government, the Court is of the view that, even if it were to be considered valid, it does not take account of the fact that the civil partnerships provided for by Law no. 3719/2008 as an officially recognised alternative to marriage have an intrinsic value for the applicants irrespective of the legal effects, however narrow or extensive, that they would produce. As the Court has already observed, same-sex couples are just as capable as different-sex couples of entering into stable committed relationships. Same ‑ sex couples sharing their lives have the same needs in terms of mutual support and assistance as different-sex couples. Accordingly, the option of entering into a civil union would afford the former the only opportunity available to them under Greek law of formalising their relationship by conferring on it a legal status recognised by the State. The Court notes that extending civil unions to same-sex couples would allow the latter to regulate issues concerning property, maintenance and inheritance not as private individuals entering into contracts under the ordinary law but on the basis of the legal rules governing civil unions, thus having their relationship officially recognised by the State."
            ],
            [
                "82. It is true that the Government’s second main argument is that Law no. 3719/2008 is designed to strengthen the legal status of children born outside marriage and to make it easier for parents to raise their children without being obliged to marry. This aspect, it is argued, distinguishes different-sex couples from same-sex couples, since the latter cannot have biological children together."
            ],
            [
                "83. The Court considers it legitimate from the standpoint of Article 8 of the Convention for the legislature to enact legislation to regulate the situation of children born outside marriage and also indirectly strengthen the institution of marriage within Greek society by promoting the notion, as explained by the Government, that the decision to marry would be taken purely on the basis of a mutual commitment entered into by two individuals, independently of outside constraints or of the prospect of having children (see paragraph 62 above). The Court accepts that protection of the family in the traditional sense is, in principle, a weighty and legitimate reason which might justify a difference in treatment (see Karner, § 40, and Kozak, § 98, both cited above). It goes without saying that the protection of the interests of the child is also a legitimate aim (see X and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 138). It remains to be ascertained whether the principle of proportionality was respected in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "84. The Court reiterates the principles established in its case-law. The aim of protecting the family in the traditional sense is rather abstract and a broad variety of concrete measures may be used to implement it (see Karner, § 41, and Kozak, § 98, both cited above). Also, given that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in present-day conditions (see, among other authorities, Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, § 31, Series A no. 26, and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 75, ECHR 2002-VI), the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family and secure respect for family life as required by Article 8, must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social and civil-status issues and relationships, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice when it comes to leading one’s family or private life (see X and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 139)."

            [
                "85. In cases in which the margin of appreciation afforded to States is narrow, as is the position where there is a difference in treatment based on sex or sexual orientation, the principle of proportionality does not merely require the measure chosen to be suitable in principle for achievement of the aim sought. It must also be shown that it was necessary, in order to achieve that aim, to exclude certain categories of people – in this instance persons living in a homosexual relationship – from the scope of application of the provisions in issue (see Karner, § 41, and Kozak, § 99, both cited above). According to the case-law cited above, the burden of proof in this regard is on the respondent Government. It is therefore for the Greek Government to show in the instant case that it was necessary, in pursuit of the legitimate aims which they invoked, to bar same-sex couples from entering into the civil unions provided for by Law no. 3719/2008 (see, to similar effect, X and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 141)."

                "86. The Court notes that the legislation in question does not merely provide for measures aimed at regulating the social realities and attaining the objectives referred to by the Government (see paragraph 80 above). It is designed first and foremost to afford legal recognition to a form of partnership other than marriage, referred to as “civil unions”. This emerges clearly from the content and structure of the Law. Section 1 defines a civil union as a “contract between two different-sex adults governing their life as a couple”. Furthermore, the subsequent sections are not confined to regulating the status of children born outside marriage, but deal with the living arrangements of couples who have entered into a civil union. Sections 6 and 7, for instance, refer to the financial relations between the parties and the maintenance obligations on dissolution of the union. Section 11, meanwhile, provides that when one partner dies the surviving partner is entitled to inherit (see paragraph 16 above)."

The Court notes in that regard that in its report on the draft legislation the National Human Rights Commission observed that it was not made clear why exactly the bill had been given the title “Reforms concerning the family, children and society”, when it actually provided for a new legal form of non-marital partnership (see paragraph 22 above). In view of the foregoing the Court considers that, notwithstanding its title and the declared intentions of the legislature, Law no. 3719/2008 was primarily aimed at affording legal recognition to a new form of non-marital partnership."

                "88. In any event, even assuming that the legislature’s intention was to enhance the legal protection of children born outside marriage and indirectly to strengthen the institution of marriage, the fact remains that, by enacting Law no. 3719/2008, it introduced a form of civil partnership, known as “civil unions”, which excluded same-sex couples while allowing different-sex couples, whether or not they had children, to regulate numerous aspects of their relationship."
            ],
            [
                "89. On this point the Court notes firstly that the Government’s arguments focus on the situation of different-sex couples with children, without justifying the difference in treatment arising out of the legislation in question between same-sex and different-sex couples who are not parents. Secondly, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that the attainment through Law no. 3719/2008 of the goals to which they refer presupposes excluding same-sex couples from its scope. It would not have been impossible for the legislature to include some provisions dealing specifically with children born outside marriage, while at the same time extending to same-sex couples the general possibility of entering into a civil union. The Court points out in that connection that the explanatory report on the legislation in issue offers no insight into the legislature’s decision to limit civil unions to different-sex couples (see paragraph 10 above). It further notes that the National Human Rights Commission considered the bill to be discriminatory since it did not apply to same-sex couples (see paragraphs 23-24 above) and that the Scientific Council of Parliament adopted a similar position (see paragraph 13 above)."

                "90. Lastly, the Court observes that under Greek law, as the Government themselves pointed out (see paragraph 64 above), different-sex couples, unlike same-sex couples, could have their relationship legally recognised even before the enactment of Law no. 3719/2008, whether fully on the basis of the institution of marriage or in a more limited form under the provisions of the Civil Code dealing with de facto partnerships. Consequently, same-sex couples would have a particular interest in entering into a civil union since it would afford them, unlike different-sex couples, the sole basis in Greek law on which to have their relationship legally recognised."
            ],
            [
                "91. In addition, the Court would point to the fact that, although there is no consensus among the legal systems of the Council of Europe member States, a trend is currently emerging with regard to the introduction of forms of legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Nine member States provide for same-sex marriage. In addition, seventeen member States authorise some form of civil partnership for same-sex couples. As to the specific issue raised by the present case (see paragraph 75 above), the Court considers that the trend emerging in the legal systems of the Council of Europe member States is clear: of the nineteen States which authorise some form of registered partnership other than marriage, Lithuania and Greece are the only ones to reserve it exclusively to different-sex couples (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). In other words, with two exceptions, Council of Europe member States, when they opt to enact legislation introducing a new system of registered partnership as an alternative to marriage for unmarried couples, include same-sex couples in its scope. Moreover, this trend is reflected in the relevant Council of Europe materials. In that regard the Court refers particularly to Resolution 1728(2010) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and to Committee of Ministers Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)5 (see paragraphs 28-30 above)."

Nevertheless, in view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the Government have not offered convincing and weighty reasons capable of justifying the exclusion of same-sex couples from the scope of Law no. 3719/2008.

On 26 May 2006 Interfax quoted the mayor of Moscow as saying in an interview to the radio station Russian Radio that no gay parade would be allowed in Moscow under any circumstances, “as long as he was the city mayor”. He stated that all three “major” religious faiths – “the Church, the Mosque and the Synagogue” – were against it and that it was absolutely unacceptable in Moscow and in Russia, unlike “in some Western country more progressive in that sphere”. He went on to say : “That's the way morals work. If somebody deviates from the normal principles [in accordance with which] sexual and gender life is organised, this should not be demonstrated in public and anyone potentially unstable should not be invited. ” He stated that 99.9% of the population of Moscow supported the ban."

It referred to provisions of the Assemblies Act concerning the authorities responsible for ensuring the safety of events ( sections 12 and 14), who were entitled to suggest changing the time or venue, or both, of a proposed event on safety grounds ( section 12). It also noted that a public event could be held at any suitable venue unless it threatened to cause the collapse of buildings or constructions or entailed safety risks for its participants ( section 8). It then noted the organisers'right to hold the event at the venue and time indicated in the notice to the authorities, or at the venue and time agreed with the authorities if they had suggested a change, and stated that it was prohibited to hold the event if the notice had not been submitted on time or if the organisers had failed to agree to a change of venue or time proposed by the authorities ( section 5). Finally, the court noted that the organisers, officials or other individuals were prohibited from interfering with the expression of opinion by the participants in the public event unless they breached public order or contravened the format of the event ( section 18). It concluded on the basis of these provisions that the authorities could ban a public event on safety grounds and that it was for the organisers to submit a notice suggesting a change of venue and time for consideration by the authorities. It considered that the refusal to hold the event in the present case had legitimate grounds and that the applicant's right to hold assemblies and other public events had not been breached."

Austria (20 September 1994, §§ 52 and 56, Series A no. 295 ‑ A) the Court had recognised the great role of religion in people's everyday life, which should be taken into account in order to prevent religious beliefs from becoming the subject of unreasonable and insulting accusations. They concluded on that basis that the State must take into account the requirements of the major religious associations and that “the democratic State must protect society from destructive influence on its moral fundamentals, and protect the human dignity of all citizens, including believers ”. In the present case, the ideas of the event organisers were not neutral to the rest of society, but had actually encroached on the rights, lawful interests and human dignity of believers."

According to them, “[s]uch relations are allowed in some countries, in other countries they are considerably restricted”. For this reason they claimed that the domestic authorities were better informed as to what might insult believers in the respective communities. To illustrate this point they referred to the case of Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (22 October 1981, §§ 56-58, Series A no. 45), in which the Court had discussed the diversity of moral and cultural values in the context of criminal liability for homosexual conduct, which had existed at the material time in Northern Ireland, while stressing that they did not adhere to the conclusion arrived at by the Court in that case. They also cited at length the case of Müller and Others v. Switzerland (24 May 1988, Series A no. 133), where the Court had upheld measures by the authorities restricting general access to an exhibition of paintings depicting “ crude sexual relations, particularly between people and animals”. They suggested that gay parades should be viewed from the same standpoint, taking into account the interests of involuntary spectators, especially children. In their opinion, any form of celebration of homosexual behaviour should take place in private or in designated meeting places with restricted access. They added that such clubs, bars and entertainment facilities existed aplenty in Moscow (listing twenty-four examples of such places) and were well frequented, their operation not being hindered by the authorities."

In the Government's view, in Moscow the public was not yet ready to accept the holding of gay parades in the city, unlike in Western countries, where such celebrations were regular occurrences. It was thus the authorities'duty to demonstrate sensitivity to the existing public resentment of any overt manifestation of homosexuality. To that end they quoted a Russian celebrity performer, whose stage image capitalised on exaggeration of homosexual stereotypes, as saying that gay parades should not be conducted. They also referred to a statement apparently made by an organisation called “The Union of Orthodox Citizens”, which promised to conduct a mass protest “should the homosexuals try to hold the march in Moscow ”. Likewise, the Orthodox Church was quoted as objecting to the gay parade as propaganda promoting sin, as had the Supreme Mufti for Russia, who had threatened mass protests by Muslims of Russia “as well as by all normal people” should the parade go ahead. They also quoted, although referring to his statement as extreme, the head Muslim authority of Nizhniy Novgorod, who had said that “as a matter of necessity, homosexuals must be stoned to death ”."

First, he disagreed that the ban on the public events he had sought to hold had been imposed in accordance with the law. He pointed out that neither the Assemblies Act nor any other legislative instrument provided for a ban on public events. The restrictions set out in section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act on holding events in venues which were unsuitable for safety reasons required the authorities to suggest another venue, as set out in section 12 of the Act, and not to ban the event. In any case, even if the Court were to accept that the alleged impossibility of avoiding public disorder at any venue could provide a justification for the ban under domestic law, the applicant maintained that the ban did not comply with two other requirements of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, in that it had failed to pursue a legitimate aim and had not been necessary in a democratic society."

As regards the three legitimate aims referred to by the Government, namely the protection of public safety and the prevention of disorder, the protection of morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the applicant considered all of them inapplicable. He argued that the reference to the protection of morals was not justified because the Government's definition of “morals” included only attitudes that were dominant in public opinion and did not encompass the notions of diversity and pluralism. Moreover, the events at issue could not by their nature affect morals because they had been intended as a demonstration in favour of human rights and civil liberties for the protection and equality of sexual minorities. No intention to demonstrate nudity or sexually explicit or provocative behaviour or material had ever been expressed by the organisers in their applications or public statements. The Government had not shown that any harm would have been caused to society or third persons by the proposed events. On the contrary, the applicant argued, the events would have been of benefit to Russian society by advocating the ideas of tolerance and respect for the rights of the lesbian and gay population."

As regards the potential riots to be caused by the counter-demonstrators, the Government had not at any stage assessed the scale of possible clashes with the events'opponents and therefore their argument of inability to provide sufficient protection to the gay parades was unsubstantiated. In the three reference years the applicant had submitted numerous applications suggesting different formats and venues for the events, and the authorities had never given reasons as to why it was not possible to make security arrangements for any of them."

Poland, no. 1543/06, § 64, ECHR 2007 ‑ VI). He submitted that the measure repeatedly taken in the present case was gravely disproportionate to the aims allegedly pursued by the authorities and was incompatible with the notion of a democratic society which was “pluralistic, tolerant and broadminded” (ibid., § 63). He argued that the authorities had failed even to attempt to comply with their obligation under Article 11 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully. They had banned the events, which in their view were likely to be attacked, instead of protecting them. Moreover, they had endorsed the disapproval expressed by the events'opponents, claiming that they were immoral and thus depriving the minority of a lawful right to hold a peaceful demonstration, a right that was inherent in a society striving to be democratic."

There is accordingly no doubt that there has been an interference with the exercise of the applicant's freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 11 § 1 of the Convention. In fact, the existence of the interference in the present case is not in dispute between the parties."

To the extent that these issues are relevant to the assessment of the proportionality of the interference they will be addressed in paragraphs 78-79 below (see Christian Democratic People's Party v.

                "“61. As has been stated many times in the Court's judgments, not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a'democratic society'(see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, §§ 86-89, ECHR 2003-II, and Christian Democratic People's Party, [cited above] ).",
                "62. While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs and artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 92, ECHR 2004 -I ).",
                "63. Referring to the hallmarks of a'democratic society', the Court has attached particular importance to pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III).",
                "64. In Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria (24 November 1993, § 38, Series A no. 276) the Court described the State as the ultimate guarantor of the principle of pluralism. Genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of these freedoms (see Wilson and the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 306 68/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, § 41, ECHR 2002-V, and Ouranio Toxo v Greece, no. 74989/01, § 37, ECHR 2005-X ). This obligation is of particular importance for persons holding unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they are more vulnerable to victimisation.”"

Their first argument, which also formed the ground on which the events were banned by the domestic authorities, related to concerns for the participants'safety and to the prevention of disorder. They alleged that the Moscow authorities, having received numerous protest petitions, had realised that any such event would cause a large-scale controversy with various groups who objected to any demonstrations supporting or promoting the interests of lesbians, gays or other sexual minorities. The petitions cited by the Government (paragraph 62 above), however, were not all of identical gist. Some petitioners, such as the Orthodox Church, simply expressed their objection to the events and to the general idea of people being homosexual and identifying themselves as such. Others, such as the Supreme Mufti, informed the authorities of their intention to hold a protest against the events, whereas the senior Muslim authority in Nizhniy Novgorod threatened violence."

The Court has previously stressed in this connection that freedom of assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention protects a demonstration that may annoy or cause offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 86, ECHR 2001-IX). The participants must be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. It is thus the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben”, cited above, §§ 32 and 34)."

The Court cannot accept the Government's argument that these petitions should be viewed as a general indication that the Pride March and the picketing had the potential to cause public disorder. The first group of petitions, calling for the events to be prohibited because the petitioners considered them immoral, without a threat of immediate counteraction at the site of the events, were irrelevant to safety considerations. They could only be taken into account for the purpose of restrictions to be imposed for the protection of morals, an issue that will be specifically addressed below."

The next group of petitions, indicating the authors'intention to engage in protest actions at the site of the events because they found them objectionable, should, on the contrary, have been carefully assessed from the standpoint of security arrangements. As a general rule, where a serious threat of a violent counter-demonstration exists, the Court has allowed the domestic authorities a wide discretion in the choice of means to enable assemblies to take place without disturbance (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben”, loc. cit. ). However, the mere existence of a risk is insufficient for banning the event: in making their assessment the authorities must produce concrete estimates of the potential scale of disturbance in order to evaluate the resources necessary for neutralising the threat of violent clashes (see Barankevich, cited above, § 33). In the present case, no preliminary assessment of the risks posed by counter-demonstrations had been carried out. The subsequent events revealed that there was a potential total of about a hundred counter-protesters, a figure that is significant but by no means overwhelming on the scale of a city such as Moscow. The Court observes, moreover, that only a few of the petitions cited by the Government expressed determination on the part of the counter- protesters to proceed by unlawful means. The Government did not make any submissions as to whether any of the petitioners had attempted to give notice of their counter- demonstration. Had they done so, the authorities could have made arrangements to ensure that both events proceeded peacefully and lawfully, allowing both sides to achieve the goal of expressing their views without clashing with each other. It was for the Moscow authorities to address potential counter-protesters – whether by making a public statement or by replying to their petitions individually – in order to remind them to remain within the boundaries of the law when carrying out any protest actions."

However, it does not appear that the authorities in the present case reacted to the cleric's call for violence in any other way than banning the event he condemned. By relying on such blatantly unlawful calls as grounds for the ban, the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organisations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order."

In the light of the above findings, the Court concludes that the Government failed to carry out an adequate assessment of the risk to the safety of the participants in the events and to public order. It reiterates that if every probability of tension and heated exchange between opposing groups during a demonstration were to warrant its prohibition, society would be faced with being deprived of the opportunity of hearing differing views on any question which offends the sensitivity of the majority opinion ( see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 107). In the present case, the Court cannot accept the Government's assertion that the threat was so great as to require such a drastic measure as banning the event altogether, let alone doing so repeatedly over a period of three years. Furthermore, it appears from the public statements made by the mayor of Moscow, as well as from the Government's observations, that if security risks played any role in the authorities'decision to impose the ban, they were in any event secondary to considerations of public morals."

In the present case, having carefully studied all the material before it, the Court does not find that the events organised by the applicant would have caused the level of controversy claimed by the Government. The purpose of the marches and picketing, as declared in the notices of the events, was to promote respect for human rights and freedoms and to call for tolerance towards sexual minorities. The events were to take the form of a march and picketing, with participants holding banners and making announcements through loudspeakers. At no stage was it suggested that the event would involve any graphic demonstration of obscenity of a type comparable to the exhibition in the case of Müller and Others (cited above) referred to by the Government. The applicant submitted, and it was not contested by the Government, that the participants had not intended to exhibit nudity, engage in sexually provocative behaviour or criticise public morals or religious views. Moreover, it transpires from the mayor's comments ( see, in particular, paragraphs 16 and 24 above) and the Government's observations (see paragraph 61 above) that it was not the behaviour or the attire of the participants that the authorities found objectionable but the very fact that they wished to openly identify themselves as gay men or lesbians, individually and as a group. The Government admitted, in particular, that the authorities would reach their limit of tolerance towards homosexual behaviour when it spilt over from the strictly private domain into the sphere shared by the general public (ibid., in fine )."

To justify this approach the Government claimed a wide margin of appreciation in granting civil rights to people who identify themselves as gay men or lesbians, citing the alleged lack of European consensus on issues relating to the treatment of sexual minorities. The Court cannot agree with that interpretation. There is ample case-law reflecting a long-standing European consensus on such matters as abolition of criminal liability for homosexual relations between adults (see Dudgeon, cited above; Norris v. Ireland, 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142; and Modinos v. Cyprus, 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259), homosexuals'access to service in the armed forces (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, ECHR 1999-VI), the granting of parental rights ( see Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, ECHR 1999-IX), equality in tax matters and the right to succeed to the deceased partner's tenancy ( see Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, ECHR 2003-IX ); more recent examples include equal ages of consent under criminal law for heterosexual and homosexual acts ( see L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, ECHR 2003-I). At the same time, there remain issues where no European consensus has been reached, such as granting permission to same-sex couples to adopt a child ( see Fretté v. France, no. 36515/97, ECHR 2002-I, and E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... ) and the right to marry, and the Court has confirmed the domestic authorities'wide margin of appreciation in respect of those issues. This, however, does not dispense the Court from the requirement to verify whether in each individual case the authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation by acting arbitrarily or otherwise. Indeed, the Court has consistently held that the State's margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24 ). The Government's reference to the concept of a “court of fourth instance” (see § 58 above) cannot prevent the Court from exercising its duties in that regard in accordance with the Convention and established case-law."

                "84. In any event, the absence of a European consensus on these questions is of no relevance to the present case because conferring substantive rights on homosexual persons is fundamentally different from recognising their right to campaign for such rights. There is no ambiguity about the other member States'recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly. As the Government rightly pointed out, demonstrations similar to the ones banned in the present case are commonplace in most European countries. It is also worth noting that in the case of Bączkowski and Others it was the domestic authorities which first acknowledged the illegal nature of the ban initially imposed on similar marches, when the ban was quashed by the appeal court (cited above, § 22)."

The mayor of Moscow, whose statements were essentially reiterated in the Government's observations, considered it necessary to confine every mention of homosexuality to the private sphere and to force gay men and lesbians out of the public eye, implying that homosexuality was a result of a conscious, and antisocial, choice. However, they were unable to provide justification for such exclusion. There is no scientific evidence or sociological data at the Court's disposal suggesting that the mere mention of homosexuality, or open public debate about sexual minorities'social status, would adversely affect children or “vulnerable adults”. On the contrary, it is only through fair and public debate that society may address such complex issues as the one raised in the present case. Such debate, backed up by academic research, would benefit social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views are heard, including the individuals concerned. It would also clarify some common points of confusion, such as whether a person may be educated or enticed into or out of homosexuality, or opt into or out of it voluntarily. This was exactly the kind of debate that the applicant in the present case attempted to launch, and it could not be replaced by the officials spontaneously expressing uninformed views which they considered popular.

In particular, it had taken him one month and fifteen days to appeal against the judgment of 26 May 2006, following an extension granted to him by the court after the expiry of the statutory time-limit of ten days. Likewise, his appeal against the judgment of 22 August 2006 had been lodged two months and ten days after the judgment, again after the extension of the time-limit."

The applicant contended that the judicial proceedings of which he had availed himself to challenge the ban were not an effective remedy because the general time-limits provided for by law did not allow a final decision to be taken before the date of the disputed event. He referred to the time-limits for giving notice of a proposed event as set out in section 7 ( 1 ) of the Assemblies Act, that is, no earlier than fifteen days and no later than ten days before the date of the event. Under Article 257 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the provisions of the Code concerning the entry of judgments into force, he argued that any decision in the case – be it the first - instance judgment or the appeal decision – was bound to become final only after the planned date of the event. Therefore, the judicial reversal of the authorities'refusal of permission to hold the events would in any case have been retrospective and therefore futile."

He asserted that the appeals had been lodged as soon as the full text of the judgment had been made available to him. Moreover, he contended that the appeal proceedings had in any event been bound to take place after the intended date of the event. Thus, the event intended to be held on 27 May 2006 had been banned by the first-instance court on 26 May 2006, only one day before the event. There had been no possibility of having the appeal against the first-instance judgment examined on the same day so that the event could have taken place had the final decision been favourable to the applicant. The notices he had submitted for the picketing had suffered a similar fate. The 2007 and 2008 applications had likewise been refused at final instance long after the intended dates of the events. The applicant further contended that there would have been no possibility of obtaining a final decision before the event in question even if the first-instance judgment had allowed the demonstration. A first-instance judgment, if not appealed against, entered into force ten days after the date of its adoption. This time-frame made it impossible for the organisers of an event, even with their best efforts and forward planning, to obtain a final decision before the scheduled date of the event, because neither the administrative authorities nor the courts were required to complete the proceedings before that date."

In the present case the Court has found that the applicant's rights under Article 11 were infringed (see paragraph 88 above).

It is therefore important for the effective enjoyment of freedom of assembly that the applicable laws provide for reasonable time-limits within which the State authorities, when giving relevant decisions, should act (ibid., § 83)."

This provision complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols. It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among other authorities, Van Raalte v.

Furthermore, when the distinction in question operates in this intimate and vulnerable sphere of an individual's private life, particularly weighty reasons need to be advanced before the Court to justify the measure complained of. Where a difference of treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation the margin of appreciation afforded to the State is narrow, and in such situations the principle of proportionality does not merely require the measure chosen to be suitable in general for realising the aim sought; it must also be shown that it was necessary in the circumstances. Indeed, if the reasons advanced for a difference in treatment were based solely on the applicant's sexual orientation, this would amount to discrimination under the Convention ( ibid, § 92 )."

Throughout these years the applicant was represented by Mr Bartenev, the lawyer who also represented him before the Court. Although the three applications have been joined in one case and therefore the applicant was dispensed from the requirement to submit separate sets of comments on the Government's observations for each of them, the original applications and the accompanying documents had to be prepared separately.

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the amounts claimed in full.
