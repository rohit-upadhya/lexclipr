The Court notes that this provision prohibits the expulsion of citizens from their national territory. However, this matter concerns the applicant ’ s wife and children who are not parties to the present proceedings. The applicant cannot himself claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 4, being an Azerbaijan citizen. This complaint must be therefore be rejected as being incompatible ratione personae, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Relying on Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant complained that his expulsion from Lithuania to Azerbaijan breached his right to respect for his family life, in view of the fact that his wife and two children are Lithuanian citizens. In addition the applicant claimed that his expulsion from Lithuania limited his right to participate in the upbringing of his children, thereby breaching Article 5 of Protocol No. 7.

The Government maintained that, before submitting the application to the Court on 12 March 2003, the applicant had not exhausted the effective remedies available under domestic law. In particular, after the Migration Department ’ s decision of 10 March 2003 ordering the applicant ’ s deportation, he made a number of complaints to the administrative courts requesting not to be deported. A final, non- appealable decision to uphold the decision of the Migration Department to deport the applicant to Azerbaijan was taken by the Supreme Administrative Court on 4 September 2003. Moreover, regarding the decision of the Migration Department not to grant the applicant refugee status, the applicant lodged a complaint with the domestic courts which dismissed it by the final decision of 22 September 2004 (see paragraph 20 above). Relying on the above, the Government claimed that, when he submitted his application to the Court, the applicant was still using accessible and effective domestic remedies."

The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against this decision to the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, and later to the Supreme Administrative Court which, on 14 October 2002, adopted the final ruling in the case and confirmed the lower court ’ s decision. The remaining decisions of the domestic authorities had, in essence, been the consequence of the above-mentioned final ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court, after which the applicant ’ s stay in Lithuania became illegal. The applicant maintained that his attempts to bring complaints regarding the subsequent administrative decisions to deport him had simply been desperate efforts to prolong the duration of his stay in Lithuania, where all his family lived. The same applied to his request to be granted refugee status."

                "30. Regarding the plea of non-exhaustion, the Court is of opinion that before lodging his application with the Court on 12 March 2003 the applicant had effectively exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, the applicant ’ s stay in Lithuania became illegal after the Migration Department ’ s decision of 14 June 2002 not to grant him a temporary residence permit, and the applicant appealed against it to both the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court, which on 14 October 2002 took the final domestic decision. It is true that, after the latter decision and after submitting the application to the Court, the applicant made numerous complaints to various State institutions. However, first, those decisions, notably the decision to deport the applicant from the territory of Lithuania, in essence only implemented the main decision of 14 June 2002 refusing temporary residence. Secondly, the Court accepts that last ditch remedies may be tried shortly after the lodging of an application but before the Court is called upon to pronounce itself on admissibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Ringeisen v. Austria, judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, § 91), as in the present case. It follows that the Government ’ s objection under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention must be rejected."

                "32. The applicant submitted that the decision not to grant him a new temporary residence permit and the resulting expulsion order infringed Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, he claimed that that decision was based solely on the allegation that he posed a “ threat to national security” contained in the file provided by the State Security Department and classified as “secret”. However, he was never informed of the contents of that file. He argued that he was genuinely integrated into life in Lithuania, where he had a business and had registered a non-governmental organisation Ibrahimas ir draugai ( “ Ibrahimas and friends ” ), the aim of which was to foster the cultural traditions of Azeris residing in Lithuania. The applicant stressed that from 1993 he had lived in Lithuania with SG, a Lithuanian citizen, whom he had married in 2001 and with whom he had two children, both of whom were also Lithuanian citizens and still underage. He was the main source of income in the household and his expulsion deprived them of financial support."

                "33. The Government considered that the applicant had only lawfully lived in Lithuania since 12 March 2001, when he had been issued with a visa. That is to say, he and his wife had only lawfully lived together for slightly more than a year before the authorities decided not to renew his residence permit. Given the short time the applicant had spent in Lithuania, he could not have developed close personal, social and economic ties in the country. The applicant ’ s wife was a Lithuanian citizen and, in her passport, her nationality was indicated as Lithuanian, not Armenian. Moreover, when the Migration Department adopted the decision to deport the applicant to Azerbaijan, there had been no military conflict with Armenia, that conflict having ended in 1994. Therefore it was possible to preserve the family unit by establishing the family ’ s residence in Azerbaijan. It follows that the applicant ’ s deportation to Azerbaijan had not interfered with his right to respect for family life."

If the Court were to find that there had been interference, the Government contended that it had been in accordance with the Law on the Legal Status of Aliens, which allowed the authorities not to grant a temporary residence permit to a person whose stay in Lithuania posed a threat to national security. The law established clear legal grounds for a refusal to issue such a permit and its withdrawal, as well as the procedure to be followed. In addition, the law provided for the applicant ’ s right of appeal to the administrative courts against the decisions to deport him. The applicant had used this right."

                "35. The Government thus maintained that in the present case the applicant ’ s deportation from the territory of Lithuania had corresponded to the legitimate aim of protecting the interests of national security. On 11 June 2002 the State Security Department had started an investigation into the applicant, who was suspected of trying to set up an organisation of an anti - national character. The data collected during the investigation had proved that the applicant ’ s activities posed a threat to national security and public order. On that basis, the Migration Department had refused the applicant ’ s request for a temporary residence permit. Since all the data submitted by the State Security Department constituted State secrets, the courts had decided not to disclose it and had, exceptionally, relied on the data as evidence. However, the courts had duly examined the information marked “restricted use” and “secret”, and had found the conclusions of the State Security Department to be well reasoned. From the above, the Government deduced that the applicant ’ s deportation from the Republic of Lithuania had been fully compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention."

            [
                "36. The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities. There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in the effective “respect” for family life. However, the boundaries between the State ’ s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. In both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1994, Series A no. 297 ‑ C, § 31)."
            ],
            [
                "37. Moreover, the Court cannot ignore the fact that the present case is concerned not only with family life but also with immigration, and that a State is entitled, as a matter of international law and subject to its treaty obligations, to control the entry of aliens into its territory and their residence there (see, among other authorities, Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). In this respect the Court notes that the duty imposed by Article 8 does not create a general obligation on the part of a Contracting State to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to accept non-national spouses for settlement in that country ( see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, § 68). However, the removal of a person from a country where close members of his or her family are living may amount to an infringement of the right to respect for family life as guaranteed in Article 8 § 1 of the Convention (see Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, § 36, Series A no. 193; see also Üner v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 57, and Boultif v. Switzerland, no. 54273/00, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX, § 39 ). Such interference will violate the Convention if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8. It is therefore necessary to determine whether there has been an interference with family life which was “in accordance with the law”, motivated by one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph, and “necessary in a democratic society”.",

The Court recalls that when deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to “family life”, a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couple live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means (see X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, § 36)."

In the present case the Court notes that there is a disagreement between the applicant and the Government as to the actual date when he lawfully arrived in Lithuania (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). However, the Court observes that in 1996 a daughter was born to the applicant and SG and that, during the administrative proceedings related to the applicant ’ s deportation, SG was expecting another child. The Court also has regard to the fact that the applicant married SG in 2001. From the above, the Court concludes that the relationship between the applicant and SG clearly amounted to “ family life ”."

As to the relationship between the applicant and his daughter LG, the Court reiterates that the notion of the “family” in Article 8 may encompass de facto “family” ties where the parties are living together outside a formal marriage. A child born of such a relationship is ipso iure part of that “family” unit from the moment of its birth, by that very fact (see Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, § 44). Therefore the Court holds that the bond between the applicant and his daughter LG, never disputed by the Government, amounted to “family life” under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court also considers that there was “family life” between the applicant and his second daughter IG.",

                "41. The Court notes that in the present case the measures taken by the State in respect of the applicant originated in a decision of the Migration Department of 14 June 2002 whereby the applicant was refused a temporary residence permit and was consequently deported from Lithuania. The Court cannot follow the Government ’ s argument that the family unit could have been preserved by establishing the family ’ s residence in Azerbaijan and that therefore there was no interference. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s wife was a Lithuanian citizen and it cannot be disputed that she had strong social and cultural ties with the Republic of Lithuania (see, mutatis mutandis, Üner v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 58). Moreover, the applicant ’ s daughters were born in Lithuania and have lived in that country all their lives. As to the applicant ’ s argument that his wife ’ s Armenian origin was an additional factor precluding her from moving to Azerbaijan, the Court observes that the documents in the case file do not substantiate that contention. However, the Court would note that, had the applicant ’ s wife indeed been of Armenian origin, the difficulties of integration into daily life in Azerbaijan might have had a certain weight (see Achmadov and Bagurova v. Sweden ( dec .), no. 34081/05, 1 0 July 2007, unreported ). From the above considerations, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s expulsion from Lithuania amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his family life and falls to be considered under paragraph 2 of Article 8.",

The Court accepts that the Migration Department ’ s decision to deport the applicant had a basis in national law, namely Articles 14, 21, 32 and 34 of the Law on the Legal Status of Aliens. In the Court ’ s view, this legislation is designed to protect, inter alia, national security which is a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8. The Court accepts therefore that the impugned decision was “in accordance with the law” and had a legitimate aim.",

                "43. The key issue in this case is whether the interference with the exercise of the applicant ’ s right to respect for his family life was necessary in a democratic society. In this respect the Court reiterates that “necessity” implies that interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the aim pursued (see Berrehab v. the Netherlands, 21 June 1988, § 28, Series A no. 138). The Court also recalls that nature and seriousness of an offence committed by an applicant may be taken into account (see Boultif v. Switzerland, cited above, § 48)."

                "44. In the present case, the Court notes that the State Security Department drafted a report, classified as “secret”, indicating that the applicant posed a threat to national security and public order. This report was the basis for the Migration Department ’ s refusal of the applicant ’ s request for a temporary residence permit. The Court draws attention to the national administrative law and practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 2 5 -2 6 above) which provide that, as a rule, factual data which constitutes a State secret may not be used as evidence in an administrative case until it has been declassified. However in the present case the “secret” report was not only used as evidence, but, according to the information in the case file, it was also the sole ground for not granting the applicant a temporary residence permit. As a result, he was deported from Lithuania. Moreover, the Government acknowledged that, when reaching their decisions, the administrative courts relied on that report but chose not to disclose the content thereof to the applicant, thus restricting his defence rights."

                "45. The Court notes that, when the case was communicated to the Government, they were requested to provide information about the threat to national security posed by the applicant ’ s stay in Lithuania. The Government ’ s response was limited to the assertion that the applicant was suspected of trying to establish an organisation of an anti - national character, but no documents or any other factual information were submitted to the Court in support of that assertion."

                "46. To ascertain whether or not the State authorities convincingly found that the applicant posed a threat to national security in the present case, the Court has regard to the following considerations. First, there was no evidence that the applicant ’ s stay in Lithuania had posed such a threat beforehand – in 2001 the authorities, after having examined his background, saw no reason to refuse him a temporary residence permit (see paragraph 8 above). It is not contested that the applicant had a previous conviction; however, as the Government noted in their observations, it was for theft and not for a crime related to national security. Moreover, that conviction had not been an obstacle for the applicant to obtain a temporary residence permit in 2001. Secondly, no objective materials verified by the domestic courts have been presented to the Strasbourg Court to demonstrate that the domestic authorities had good reasons to suspect the applicant of being a threat to national security. From the foregoing, the Court finds that, in the case file before it, there are no documents allowing the Court to conclude that the applicant posed such a threat. Nonetheless, the applicant was deported and until 2099 is prohibited from re- entering Lithuania, where his two children and wife, all of whom were Lithuanian citizens, live, which is also an important element for the Court to take into account when assessing the necessity of the interference and its proportionality."

The applicant also complained of a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, alleging that the proceedings in the determination of the lawfulness of his stay in Lithuania were unfair. In this connection the Court reiterates that decisions regarding the entry, stay and deportation of aliens do not concern the determination of an applicant ’ s civil rights or obligations or of a criminal charge, within the meaning of this Convention provision (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 82, ECHR 2005 ‑ I).
